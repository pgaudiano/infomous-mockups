<h1 style="text-align:center;">Infomous Live Demos</h1>

This page offers links to a handful of live demos showing Infomous in action. Clicking any link will open the corresponding demo in a new window or browser tab.

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.infomous.com/#tab=news/world" target="_blank">Today's World News from Infomous</a>. This is our main page for browsing world news, an example of a <em>News Navigator</em>.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/12/5-things-to-know-friday/2511197/" target="_blank">USA TODAY News Navigator</a> (scroll to the bottom of the article). This is another <em>News Navigator</em>, in this case showing how USA TODAY can help readers find news from its entire web site in a convenient, interactive fashion.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2013/12/20/2013-top-stories-word-cloud/4140497/" target="_blank">USA TODAY 2013 in Review</a>. An example of our <em>Time Machine</em>, which lets you browse, week-by-week, top stories on USA TODAY from 2013.</li>

<li> <a href="http://www.infomous.com/site/events/WorldCup2014/" target="_blank">2014 World Cup on Twitter</a>. This is a sample <em>Social Spotlighter</em> based on my personal passion for the World Cup. Click team names to see tweets related to that team.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.infomous.com/site/client/NFL/" target="_blank">NFL Films</a>. A different kind of social spotlighter - actually a list of ten pages, capturing social media related to the top ten most buzzworthy moments of the 2013 season. This is the centerpiece of a special episode of NFL Top 10 that will air in late summer of 2014.</li>
