			<description>Okay. So, I'm giving this four stars, not five because there are probably 3 lights in the entire park, so I'm lucky I didn't fall in the dark and die or something equally unpleasant. Despite the lack…</description>

Quite expensive, but happy hour is really cheap. Best sushi I've had in the area. Really fast service too, even when it's overcrowded.
