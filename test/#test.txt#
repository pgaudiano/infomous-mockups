test/16 Jan 2013 - Evergreen Brickworks site visit

EB folks: Stuart, Cameron, Robert, Jeff, Melanie, Ozgur (also met
Colin - building maintenance guy)
CISCO: Gordon
Schneider: Jarrett and Pam 

Jeff - 43M bricks per year. Built a lot of the city. Use the history
as a catalyst to go from tech infrastructure to city design. Smart
cities / broad fabric of city buildings.

Gordon: e.g., 2-5pm site tour. At top of that, history, role it
plays. Then 2 blocks diving deeper. 

Jeff: there is a guy who talks about urban design and how smart
cities. 

PG: maybe self-guided tours with iPad/Android QR codes etc. Big tour
could be tough.

GF: we can cap number of participants and do multiple bands.

Jeff: this has a bit of a campus / urban feel, greater range of
possibilities. Ice Fair makes ice at night to cool the building during
the day.

Pam: want to help you share data and bring it into a single
system. Show less intervention required. Also from user side -
understand impact of opening windows. Take data from whichever system
and show it to people..

GF: So perhaps it could be accessible to people during the tour. On
their own screen?

PM: maybe.

Jarrett: coming out with a power outlet load metering. We are coming
out with a power strip that can meter and control things. Smart
plug. Put power strips at people's desks and show power consumption.

*** 30-50% of your energy is probably from plug loads. We could take a
place in the building and monitor usage in the space. Extract to
municipality, city, etc.

Best example: most people have cell phone charger plaugged
in. Dissipates energy all night long. We can see this and then shut it
off. Can program strip on timer, on usage pattern, etc. Brand new
offer, launching it in a couple of weeks in London at CISCO live.

Also CISCO phones can be integrated. Can be powered off phone when you
leave your desk.

Cam: new CISCO phones will have a larger screen - can it be used for
display of this info as well? What can the screens do?

Gordon: good question. E.g., send a message to people when about to
shut down. That kind of visual communication to visitors would be
cool. 

Jeff: big story is notion of retrofit. Take old crappy buildings and
use integration of technology to make them better. 

Robert: parallel is the pace/rate of change happening in this
field. We designed this building's systems 4-5 years ago and already
looking to augment. Possibilities there as well.

GF: in terms of sequencing, when story is told early in the process
early on the 10th. Story about the site, location, regeneration, use
of old assets. Jeff, you can do that?

J: sure.

GF: that will feed into how it has potential to be rolled out to whole
campus. Even the whole city could be retrofitted. 

I understand there is a discussion with Philips to retrofit lighting?

Jeff: yes, but not sure of status.

*** [Who was the guy from WSIE? Look it up] Folks from Philips
    lighting interested in this.

Stuart: looking at your site. Complexity of cities. How to simulate
interventions, how subsystems come together. What are the points where
collaboration can be good? [PG: I think he is thinking of another
company - mentioned something about Mass transportation]

Jeff: we could play a brokerage role with Metrolinks - $60B strategy
over the next decades. Amalgamate and create efficiencies across
transportation systems. They are modeling but having problems. Biggest
problem is in communication. Visualization and how they are selling
their ideas.

** We also have a great relationship, could make some intros.

Had a good meeting with Samsung. Made a $7-12B investment in Ontario
to be a hub for renewable energy strategy in North America. Big
investment, they are looking to build up arguments around
renewables. Need to do efficiency modeling and data
visualization. Political implications as they move toward an election.

Also doing aproject on hour of the future. Foresight, next 50 years of
urbanization. LEED partners with World Bank and World Economic Forum,
possibly UN. 3-phase project, looking at how much $$ we will spend on
building cities in the next 50 years? Based on current patterns ift
could be 500-600T. Series of planning exercises. First exercise: we cannot
buildg 600T. How do we do it? not with current pattern. Most feel it
will be a modification of current strategies, we thin more of a leap.

Phase 2 will be scenario planning, modeling, data visualization,
storytelling. Risk management, and aspirations/opportunities. Working
with Oxford and LSE, Accenture in the UK (partner in Phase 1). 

PG; lots of descriptions

Gordon: will follow up after MotM

Jeff: MotM is a big deal for us. We do corporat launches all the time,
Google did one. Another half million $$ event next week.

But we see MotM not as a one-off event. We are not a conference
facility. This is baked in.

GF: there is one track to followup, consulting inside Schneider about
what can take place. Also maybe pre-press tour ahead of time. Second
track is Paolo (and Eric) thinking about what could Ico bring that
might be the kind of size and intellectual investment that Ico wants
to make. Discuss with Schneider and Evergreen people, happy to be
sounding board. Not technical, but maybe a neutral party for feedback.

Also Cisco/Evergreen continue to discuss how the tour can go. Also
short version of tour on 10th-11th for those who missed it on the
9th. We are putting together a master schedule in SF office.

We need to put together the language for the invitation. If you want
to send it that might be better.

Jeff: we will focus on the audience to get here and how to do it, some
expression of the collaboration would be good.

*** Need to leverage this and put it on our site.

GF: goal is to have some of the ideas shown n the site so when people
click they can see what has been confirmed etc.

PM: I'd like to see profile of who we are inviting, to help identify
internal who to bring in. Right members of Canadian team.

Jarret: I have that, need to bring you into a meeting on Monday.

GF: thanks to all. Jef fyou'll come back from Davos with new ideas.

For our Urban Future we'll have a breakout session to dig into
details. 

*** I NEED SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP COORDINATE ALL THIS STUFF AND LEARN
    ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PROGRAMS etc.
