Rohit and Samantha 26 March 2010

Samantha: Director of Strategic Technology manages field engineers.

I'll take 30 min to give you an overview of the system, then deeper
dive into inventory aspects.

Real-time reporting

Let's go straight to campaign set-up

PG: who is your typical user?

R: typically geared toward publisher. They forge a partnership to use
our platform. In your world, boston.com. Want to work with an ad
server. Their traffic managers get campaigns from advertisers. Traffic
manager gets insertion order. So they see all the campaigns.

Operational arm of publisher to sift through campaigns they have
sold. Make sure the system meets the goals, and optimize things.

If publisher has contract to deliver a certain campaign, these reports
have the proof they need. Reports are important from the point of use
of advertiser for success of campaigns, but also help publishers to
show their ability to meet goals, and thus sell more.

Some reports are geared to external elements, but some are for the
traffic manager to show if it is on target, if it's meeting criteria,
if it's delayed, by how much?

Also there is inventory competition, as there are hundreds of
thousands of campaigns running at the same time. Therein lies part of
the problem for which we are engaging you.

PG: Sorry to ask basic questions!

RG: No problem.

Each campaign has different scheduling and targeting criteria.

Here is an example: 

Overview, schedule/billing, pages, excluded sites/pages, creatives,
target, notifications (alerts etc., can be set with thresholds).

TARGET:
Domain


...

Query targeting: 126 possible page positions on the page. Each request
to the server provides information about the content, the pseudo-URL
and the position, plus a query string consisting of keyword-value
pairs that consist of search terms for targeting.

So if you want additional targeting information you would employ the
query string (e.g., gender=female,age=45,...) or let's say someone is
under arts & entertainment, someone looking at "contemporary art"
has that sent as a query.

Cookie targeting: if some publishers have cookie info and package it
in the query, then we can use that.

RDB = Registration Data Base (if available)

Behavioral Targeting

PG: how do you blend Claritas, Omniture or their other behavioral one?

RG: some advertiser may want to use Claritas. Others Omniture.

Let's say someone comes to publisher and says "I am interested in all
folks interested in art & entertainment". If you take everyone who is
interested in A&E, then it's fine.

BUt what if someone who is interested in A&E shows up on a sports
section, then how do you use the information? Then you put them in a
segment regardless of where they are on the site.

Segments are very tactical. Claritas is an historical breakdown of
markets based on demographics, usage, etc.

The segmentation is tactical, based on how they interact with your
site. E.g, someone doing a certain thing may be interested in buying a
car, which Claritas will never tell you about.

SCHEDULING AND BILLING TAB

Impressions, clicks or uniques.

Priority level: all the way to the right, "S" means
sponsorship. Exclusive campaign on a given page. So the basic level
from inventory standpoint is a certain position on the page. Each page
has multiple positions. That's the most granular level. Competition is
among campaigns to grab each spot. AdServer tries to deliver the
highest priority campaigns first, but make sure you don't completely
block everyone.

We set a 15-minute goal for top priority campaigns, then if those are
met go to the next ones.

Weight: if priority and everything else is the same, twice the weight
means twice the exposure.

PG: So, different campaigns from different advertisers are based on
price? E.g., Nike vs. Reebok.

Priority of 20 will always deliver more than an 18. But in addition,
need to look at CPM tabulation against priority.

Switch to CONFIGURATION of PRIORITY LEVEL.

You build a grid as a publisher to say, you know, I get CPMs in the
$20 range, anything above that is priority 20 (top). Tabulate in terms
of eCPM (expected CPM) ranges min-max.

So now when I go to billing fees and set a CPM target and use the
yield manager, then the system figures it out automatically.

"Competitive separation". Let's say Delta airlines and American
Airlines. Two competing advertisers on contract do not want to show up
together. Something else the delivery mechanism needs to check.

You can always do overrides e.g.. if a campaign near end is way below
targets, turn up priority.

Also can specify what goals have to be met in order to end campaign.

REACH: 
house campaigns only deliver when no paid campaign can be delivered.
fixed campaign: exactly some number of clicks
Dynamic, some flexibility but no major swings. Initially figure out
how many impressions to deliver daily, and tries to deliver that
number, but then adapt the next days to balance out.

Open: don't care, usually long-term campaign with no fixed hard goals.

Fixed: calculated same as dynamic campaign as to what is delivered for
a given day. Or you can have daily click number, or an impression
overrun (e.g., give advertiser 10% bonus, for whatever reason).
Daily delivery rate: ASAP or smooth.

Companion positions. This too complicates inventory
management. Campaigns fighting for a spot, and some fighting for
multiple spots simultaneously. SOme competitive blocking.

Frequency: we can cap frequency for a particular user. Primary
frequency, e.g., no more than two impressions per day, and maybe no
more than 10 per month.

PG: what percentage of users cannot be tracked?

RG: very small. Most require cookies. We typically generate our cooky
in the publisher's domain. If they turn it off they will be in trouble
with their experience.

PG: But this is not a big deal?

RG: not really, we can also track IP etc., but the reality is that
it's not perfect in the industry. They will not always deliver
messaging exactly as required. But if you are on Boston.com and have
turned off cookies, then Boston.com will not provide certain
facilitation mechanisms.

PAGES:

Sections can be used to provide a higher-level control, e.g., target
at section level to capture multiple page types.

OK, so if you get the point, it's a marriage of content and
audience. Then campaigns are trying to gather or corner that piece of
content and make sure they are showing up to be viewed by the right
people.

Traffic managers typically know what sort of positions support which
type of ads, in some cases they can rotate as long as it does not ruin
the point of the campaign.


NEXT STEP: INVENTORY AND REPORTS

Two aspects of inventory manager.

(1) Give provider historical perspective in terms of what transpired
with position, page, section, # of impressions... and also (2)
futuristic aspect in terms of forecast: based on past historical
patterns, we expect that this piece of real estate will generate this
much impressions. And you may have overbooked, or have spare
inventory.

CONFIGURATION

Historical period: past 4 weeks, past 12 weeks, same period last year,
custom period.

Algorithms:

Uniform growth: same growth as you have experience in the past

day of week - uniform growth: some sites show different patterns on
weekends and weekdays

day of week - no growth.

flat average

custom growth: skew up or down by certain percentage.

PG: is this at publisher level? section level? page level?

RG: that's the crux: this is at publisher level. That's a big
deficiency.

PG: I am guessing they use it for inventory forecasting and pricing?

RG: yes, but a third one is to make sure that if they are overbooked
or reach a certain level of booking, they have to satisfy advertisers
and make sure they can deliver against promises, that they can
deliver.

PG: how would they do this??? Create new content?

Well, one way is you can add capacity (unlike hotels or airlines). SO
if you add a page, you can deliver more. Another thing might be:
Mr. advertisers, we could only deliver 80% of impressions, but folks
were paying more for them, so if you want to guarantee delivery, then
you have to pay us a bit more.

PG: what is the typical forecasting horizon?

RG: typically six months, but sometimes a year.

PG: from which I derive that you don't really account for spikes,
tsunamis etc.?

RG: well it depends on the site, e.g., they could use a custom growth
rate if the weather is unstable. Or maybe on a political site, when
the Clinton impeachment story went on for a long time, hard to
predict. Some publishers may have a small growth curve.

Also another aspect, each section will behave differently.

Now let's look at forecast at lowest level: pages.

Remnant inventory is what kicks in when you don't have any more paid
inventory.

Similar snapshot at section level, site level, various levels in the
hierarchy.

Note that this is without an overlap of the audience. Not capturing
the features of the audience. So no overlay of targeting aspects from
inventory standpoint.

PG: unclear about Total (which is the forecast from the model)
vs. Booked (which is the booked campaigns but not necessarily
executed).

So, back to overlaying the targeting on this.

Given sheer number of targeting criteria, we do this in a piecemeal
level. E.g., geographically we go down only by section.

Geography inventory. Select your criteria, e.g., geo-targeting. Select
the section, e.g. business. Check out resulting report.

Forecasting cannot be done at page level. 

Also keyword forecasting. 

PG: so all the forecasting is purely based on each publisher and his
or her own data? What if you are a new client?

RG: not meaningful until you've been around for a few weeks, but it
depends on how predictable you are as a site.

But if you have a big spike that is not representative, then the
numbers could take a long time to reveal the true picture.

PG: you provide the specific keywords?

Yes, you don't have to do it manually.

RG: now we overlay on this the audience caps such as frequency. And
then companion requirements.

PG: but does that complicate ad delivery or forecasting?

RG: if you see things not working, e.g., you set a frequency cap at 7, but
you see little click through after 3rd impression, then you may change
that on the fly.

DD: Are all those other things captured in the forecasting?

No. IN some cases we have done some custom things for clients that
include some audience interactions.

PG: so, the biggest problems are in inventory forecasting?

Absolutely, checking inventory forecasting. For one thing, blanket
inventory by publisher is not good. Second, in addition to algorithms
we have, we need others. Third, we need to factor in a much more
multi-variate system than what we have seen. We do not have bandwidth
and do not have a statistical expertise in-house. We do not employ
people like that, but we understand your company has.

We are aware of deficiencies. This could be improved with one or two
things. BUt for us to take it on we'd have to take it on, but need the
expertise and time.

DD: what do you mean by multivariate?

Interplay of audience and content. Geographies, ... How about
geography, with content, with a certain segment of user?

The combination of any element of targeting, and also frequency cap,
etc. E.g., I can tell you about anyone willing to buy a car in the LA
target and who is in a certain income level -- and we can provide you
1000 such users.

You don't need hundreds of conditions, because if it only generates 5
people they publishers don't want that.

PG: we would probably take more of a user-centric forecasting
approach.

RG: we did not use to do that (user-centric) at all, have tried a
little, but unfortunately not much interest in the industry. It makes
sense, ultimately you are reaching an audience. At the end of the day
it's all about behavior. If you target them about finance, it has to
do with behavior.

PG: do you think we can go after one of your clients for a joint
project?

RG: need to work with someone big and who covers a lot of factors that
could then be generalized.

PG: what about a 1/4 mil? How significant would that be?

PG: we'd like to do it holistically.

RG: that's a lot of money even for one of our customers. I can give
Dave a sense of what you said. See what he thinks. What about timing?

Hardware?

No big deal.

One element that is important to mention: the whole for you to figure
out how a campaign will deliver against that inventory. So that's the
other complication, factoring in the performance of the
campaign. Could you do that as well? Mapping the campaign behavior
based on prioritization.

PG: Is your business based on traffic or not?

Yes, but unfortunately commoditized. E.g., google is killing us and
devaluing the charge for serving ads. Not about the technology.

VOlume based but price pressure on it.

PG: OK, we'll think it over and send you some sort of outline.
