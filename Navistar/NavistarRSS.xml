Ronnie, as our conversation here are the part numbers and issues , first Cy Fair I.S.D. drivers heater core 2585989c1 natl fleet $ 909.00 , they said they

Can purchase this locally under a Kysor # 2612251 for $ 189.00, second pricing complaints on surge tank # 2602943c91 this price has increased

From 2010  for $ 95.00, to 2011 $ 221.00, to current price of $ 315.68   this is  a duel port sure tank with a long hose and a piece of reflective tape

There is another tank ( the tank itself is identical ) with a shorter hose and no tape 2602872c91 that sell for $ 153.09 customers do not understand

Why such an increase and price difference. Thanks Ray Z.

  I TALKED WITH THREE DIFFERENT DEALERS.  IT  SEEMS LIKE AT THE MOMENT FLYERS ARE NOT IN VOGUE.

PRICING COMPARISONS ARE WORSE THAN EVER.  LET ME EXPLAIN THE ATTACHED.

ITEM # 1.  THIS IS A PTO WE ARE INSTALLING ON 50 NEW UNITS.  NAV. PRICE IS $ 581.96.  CUSTOMER WAS

QUOTED $ 495.02.  OBVIOUSLY OUR COMPETITION IS MAKING A PROFIT.   WE HAVE ASKED FOR AN SPA.  

WE WILL PURCHASE OUTSIDE IF WE DO NOT HEAR PROMPTLY.

ITEM # 2

IN THE SPIRIT OF DEALING WITH CARQUEST WE PURCHASED THIS BATTERY FOR 100.07.  NAV.DEALER NET

WAS $ 49.05 .  WHERE IS THE RECIPROCITY?

ITEM # 3.  

THIS IS A PAGE FROM A COMPETITOR SHOWING THE HEATER CORE REFERRED TO YOU IN THE MESSAGE

I FORWARDED YOUFROM RON HARTMAN.  THE PRICING IS RIDICULOUS.    

 

DISREGARD THE SEAL PRICING MEMO.  I ADDRESSED IT LAST YEAR.  DON&apos;T KNOW HOW IT GOT COPIED.

 

SORRY COULD NOT GIVE YOU MORE.  I WILL FORWARD JACK SAUMS RESPONSE.

Vince,

 

Thank you for sharing the data.  I do have a question.  Can you tell me what price level these prices would be compared to?

 

·         For example, the Bendix 102657N is advertised at $21.91 in attachment 5.  Current Navistar National Fleet is $12.89 and Retail is $25.86 for part BX102657N.  Would you be competing at the Retail price level with this competitor?

 

·         Bendix Air Dryer Cartridge is 109685X is $157.91 in the advertisement.  Navistar National Fleet is $179.17 and Retail is $378.13.  What price level would we be comparing to in this example?
