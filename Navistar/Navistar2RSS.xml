<title>Litsheim, John FW: spicer clutch price</title>
<description>Our competitor can sell this clutch to us for $10 over your 72 piece direct price.  They are making more than $10 on the sale.  We are their biggest competitor.  They don&apos;t like us. 
This does not make sense.

Attached is example of clutch, PN C121000EX, sold to us by Badger for $10.00 over 72 piece trailer load cost.

<title>Litsheim, John FW: price discrepancy</title>
<description>Our Parts people tell me that the Spectra heater core number below is the same application as the “C” number.

If that is accurate, then there is an unrealistic variance in price.

<title>Matos, Justin M Alliant Power:  Current pricing and other detailed info available on the Parts Sharepoint site</title>
<description>I have been running up against Alliant Power (Distributed as Diesel Injection Services located just outside of Madison, WI).  I had scanned a copy of their Navistar offering from one of their catalogs about 4 weeks ago.  Yesterday while I was at Hawkeye International in Waterloo, Iowa, another Alliant distributor, Diesel Specialties Inc. (Sioux City, IA) dropped off the same catalog along with their current price book on CD.  The salesperson was sure to make note of the pricing advantages for dealers to by-pass the OEM channel, which was obviously disturbing.

 

In efforts to make sure you have access to this information, I loaded it to the SharePoint drive (access through the link below).  Please review and pass on to anyone that would benefit from having this information.  Alliant is causing some significant damage in Wisconsin and Iowa.  I would estimate that lost sales to Navistar are very substantial.  Please note that the catalog uses Navistar part numbers.

 

Most concerning, is that despite what the catalog states, I was told that the new strategy is that Alliant is beginning to provide parts and labor coverage; which, previously, only parts coverage was provided.  

 

I hope the information is beneficial and supports your efforts.

Thank you,

<title>Doug Jones 1841217C91</title>
<description>Randy,

Attached is an invoice from Paul Miller Ford that our customer (Blue Bank Diesel) sent to us on an IPR valve Navistar part# 1841217C91, our cost is $221.88 and NF is $339.54. As you can see this customer purchased it for less than our cost. Is there anything that can be done on pricing to make us more competitive?

Thanks,

<title>Bolin, Robert A (Randy) RE: 1841217C91</title>
<description>With Navistar placing  both a International number  and Ford number on the box, our customers are now calling the Ford dealers and buying the part from Ford at a much lower price, and returning the unused part back to International. We should be competitive with Blue Diamond on “like” parts. If not, then our customers will continue to buy from the Ford channel, and return the parts back to our dealers.  This is in regards to part number 1841217C91

<title>Warren, Nicole S FW: Pricing descrepency Fan Shroud brackets</title>
<description>
Can you please review the email below from Southeastern Freight Lines regarding two fan shroud mounting brackets on their ProStar + trucks?

 

Parts number 3835656C2 (item# 20) has a list of $40.30 with HF of $26.52.  This looks to be in line to me or at least not excessive.

 

Part number 3838891C2 (item# 35) though looks like a major pricing error.  We show a list of $401.01 and NF of $263.82.  I hope this is a mistake.

 

Can you please check these out and let me know so I can get back to the customer.

 

If this isn’t your, can you please pass it on to the correct person and copy me?

Please take a look at item# 20 (3835656C2 Retails for $48.36) and item# 35 (3838891C2 Retails for $401.01). Both are supports. 

 

We’re thinking there has been a mistake in pricing. Both should be around that $40.00 dollar mark.

<title>Patel, Arjav FW: JOSA400UT17 / JOSA400UT217 - complaining on pricing</title>
<description>Need help please.  We have a dealer complaining that the two parts above are overpriced.  Apparently Fleetpride is selling JOSA4007T17 for $325.00 each and not D/S.  Can you check into this for us?  They are also under the impression that JOSA40075217 is the same scenario.


Just want to let someone know that Fleetpride is sell this same part number in their stores for $325.00 each and not direct ship. We are way over priced on JOSA400UT17 landing gear and I am sure we are over priced on JOSA400UT217 also. We lost a order for 10 of the JOSA400UT17 because of be over priced and they did not have freight to pay either. Can we have someone look at pricing again on part number JOSA400UT17 to see why we are so much higher?

<title>Harris, Mike P Fwd: Head Light Bulbs for Volvos   -- Need a Quote</title>
<description>	Not sure who the new lighting person is but would like this to get forwarded to him or her.  This is a scenario that unfolded over the last couple of days over something that looked simple but turned into lost sales due to pricing.

	This is something similar to what we have gone through on other items that are similar in product that should be priced similar.  So you would think that a high beam and a low beam should be similar in price.

	Your pricing is so far off it isn’t worth going after. 

  
	I low beam headlight is $23.26 and you can get from Volvo for $11.68, that cant be right

<title>Harris, Mike P Fwd: Quantity discounts</title>
<description>	Since I missed the call, I have enclosed some examples of quantity breaks that jump out as unusual.  The  first 3 are exhaust clamps and they are discounted at an appropriate level.  The others clearly show how cheaply Navistar is purchasing these items.  We also have a problem pricing to our customers because the only cost that is downloaded is the higher “each” cost.  Has anyone mentioned this?  I know it can be done as a special cost/special price but then someone has to monitor and maintain those fields.  I know the discounts are to help the dealers but probably don’t get passed along to the customer.

	 

	Thanks,

<title>mike.jacobs Fleetguard Filters</title>
<description>Attached is a copy of an invoice that one of our customers sent to me when he picked up filters at this &quot;repair shop&quot;.  Looking at this, I would have to ask how a &quot;repair shop&quot; without any OEM affiliation could sell Fleetguard filters over the counter to a &quot;walk-in&quot; customer with pricing that is below what Interstate Motor Trucks, Inc.can purchase even at the $75,000.00 level.
I think we need to purchase our Fleetguard filters from &quot;Ron&apos;s Repair, Inc.&quot;
I realize that this invoice is from Aug of 2011, so I went back to the Navistar price file from the same time period and wrote the pricing on the invoice copy. (highlighted in yellow)
What is going on?

<title>Dave Baxter RE: Emailing: 1836542c1 gasket</title>
<description>To be clear the price was not the first thing in question.

I have 3 vt365 engine jobs being perform in my shop and there is no
stock on these gaskets in any pdc currently.

Ford had stock and they made money on the sale and they were cheaper
currently.

P.S. having the gasket no longer in the intake manifold mtg kit part #
1840701c93 is kind of odd.(that really started all the searching)

<title>Harris, Mike P Re: over priced parts</title>
<description>	Gentleman, since we haven&apos;t seen a parts representative from I/C for about a year and a half or more and don&apos;t even know who ours would be at the moment I am sharing this in case it does matter to anyone. Please find the first two attached pictures of a cheap plastic trash can (pt.# 2225560C1)  offered as an accessory thru I/C parts. As you will notice dealer cost is $50.33  list price to the customer $74.02  there is also a couple of simple brackets that go with the can that are also grossly over priced that I will not even bore you with.  We ordered this high tech trash can at the request of a customer, the good thing is we did not have it drop shipped as it was delivered broken as you can see in the third picture, I guess the rice paper box did not afford enough packing for it to withstand the rigorous effects of shipping. 

	Another example of over priced parts is (pt.#412612005) inside emergency door handle - (steel 1 inch x 12 inch,) dealer cost $321.00 ea.   We have a local metal shop make them for us @ $12.00 ea.

	I don&apos;t know how I/C goes about setting their parts prices, but we find on going many parts priced ridiculous, for those parts we have to find another supplier if we want sell the part in stead of our competitors. It sure makes it difficult to get our desired amount of parts market share with these kinds of prices.

We are preaching to the managers to use OE parts for warranty etc yet this is a bit hard to swallow … and the aftermarket ones are all metal.

<description>

Good morning 

 

I would like to have someone check the pricing on a PartSmart item

 

Part # SMR20248           Cost: $ 34.34            .23 % increase +

 

Back in Jan I purchased it for $ 27.76

 

My problem is that I put that item on the March/April My Edge flyer and the price I used was National Fleet pricing with was $ 33.85

 

A 23% + increase in pricing is kind of high 

 

Off all the PartSmart items I put on the flyer that is the only one that is off in pricing.

 

Thank you very much,

Good morning again

 SMR430030   Wheel Chock

I found a part that the price increase 105+% from Nov till know with doesn’t make any sense. 

Last purchased cost was $ 10.04 and today if I was going to purchase this item $ 20.94

 

My problem is that I put this item on MYEdge sale for March/April for the old national fleet pricing $17.65

With is less than today’s cost.

 

When we make these flyers it is a few months in advance and if the pricing goes up 105% this mess thing up 

And as a company we are losing money

 

Thanks,

If you can find out something today, that would be great as I have been questioned by several folks.

Have a great day!

<title>Bolin, Robert A (Randy) RE: Specials from local KW store</title>
<description>Gentlemen

Above are the specials like we have in My Edge.  Look at the CR seal pricing from the local KW store.  They are selling below our cost or just a few dollars over.  When we can get to their pricing on CR seals then we could be more of a competitor.  With this information can we see how they are selling at these prices and help us the dealer be more competitive with these guys.
