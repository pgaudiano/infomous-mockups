<h2>Infomous Mockups for Twitter</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.infomous.com">Infomous</a> is a cool new way to
navigate online information through <em>interactive text
  clouds</em>. Infomous can summarize and display text from many
sources, including RSS feeds and Twitter Feeds.

<p>
<h3>How could Twitter use Infomous?</h3>

Twitter has established
itself as the dominant platform for real-time information exchange. However, the
text-based nature of Twitter can make consumption of that information
challenging. Infomous can support Twitter users by providing a quick,
interactive, visual snapshot of Tweets.

<p>Here are two examples of how Twitter could use Infomous to
  support its user base (links open in a new window/tab):

<p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="index1.html" target="_blank">Embed an Infomous cloud in a user's Twitter home</a></li>
  <li><a href="index2.html" target="_blank">Embed an Infomous cloud to show Twitter
  search results</a></li>
</ul>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-size:12px">
Note: in the mockups above, the clouds are based on the tweets at the moment you view the page, while the rest of the page is static. Hence the tweets seen on the left of the page will probably not reflect those seen in the cloud.
</span>

<p>And here is an example of how a publisher such as
  EntertainmentWeekly might use an Infomous cloud to show its own
  tweets on its own site (note: this is not an official web page, nor
  was it approved by Entertainment Weekly):

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="index4.php" target="_blank">Mockup of a Twitter Cloud on
    EW.com (see the right column just below TV Watch)</a>
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Why would Twitter want to use Infomous?</h3>
<p>

<ol>
  <li>Infomous clouds provide a visual snapshot that makes it easier for
  users to visualize and navigate tweets.</li>
  <li>Infomous clouds can be used to deliver unobtrusive, contextually
  relevant text advertising similar to search engine advertising, but
  based on dynamic content of interest to your users.
</ol>

<p>
We believe Infomous will become a dominant navigation tool, and that
it will revolutionize the way advertisement is delivered. We would
love to collaborate with a leading, innovative company like Twitter.

<p>
<h3>Additional Infomous features</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Infomous clouds are fully customizable: size, colors, number of
  words, feeds, ... Twitter could choose to control customization or
  give its users some flexibility in their own clouds.
  <li>Infomous runs as SaaS, hosted on Amazon EC2 (which, in spite of
  recent issues, is quite robust).
  <li>Infomous can be easily embedded, requires virtually no
  "installation"
  <li>The nature and quality of the words, as well as the links, can
  be fully filtered or manipulated to allow for different types of
  user experience. For example, we could add a "chronology" feature
  allowing users to visualize tweets over a specific date range.
</ul>
