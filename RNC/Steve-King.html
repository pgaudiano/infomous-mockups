August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Steve King Republican National Committeeman from Wisconsin (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 Good evening. In two short months, our country faces a momentous decision. We will decide whether to continue our slide into debt and dependence, or whether to restore opportunity and self-determination. I believe, at this time, America is looking for leadership. Americans are searching for substance. We are here tonight because Mitt Romney has chosen the first real leader of his generation, a man who can help us believe in America again -- and his name is Paul Ryan! We are here tonight, as Republicans, united and excited for a Romney-Ryan presidency! I remember talking with Paul when he was weighing his first congressional race. Even at the age of 27, he was a man with big ideas and the courage of his convictions. Paul's time in politics has been a family affair. His brother Tobin helped lead Paul's first campaign. His mother Betty and sister-in-law Oakleigh knocked on doors and handed out fliers. Now Paul is joined by his wife Janna, his daughter Liza, and his sons Charlie and Sam. You'll find them in church and later watching a Packers or Brewers game, or swapping hunting and fishing stories with family. From his very first campaign, Paul Ryan asked voters directly: "Hire me." And has since always reminded his constituents: "Remember, I work for you!" He never forgets who he works for. And no one has been more diligent and effective in working for the good of Wisconsin and America. Paul Ryan has the courage to tell the truth ­ even when the truth is hard to hear. Paul Ryan has big, thoughtful ideas. Paul Ryan has the determination to tackle tough challenges ­ even those that others choose to ignore.Paul Ryan is the leader we need at this critical moment in our nation's history. Mitt Romney believes that. Do we? Ladies and gentlemen, it is my singular great honor and distinct privilege to nominate my good friend, my fellow citizen of Janesville, Wisconsin, a genuinely good man from the Midwest -- Paul D. Ryan -- to be vice president of the United States of America! Thank you! ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
