August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Deb Fischer Republican Candidate for the United States Senate from Nebraska (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 Thank you. I'm not your typical politician. I'm a wife. I'm a mother of three grown sons, a rancher, a small business owner and a citizen-legislator. Becoming a U.S. Senator has never been an ambition of mine. But over the last four years, I've become dismayed with the record spending, the record debt, and the record unemployment. The Obama administration has been out of touch with the American people, and they've driven our country towards the edge of a fiscal cliff. We're on track to become the first generation that passes on fewer opportunities to the next. And that is unacceptable. But it doesn't have to be this way. I'm running for the U.S. Senate because I know we can do better. I've been a Senator in the Nebraska legislature these past eight years. And in Nebraska, we have an unemployment rate of only 4 percent. How did we get there? We cut spending. We balance our budget every year. We passed the biggest tax relief package in the history of our state. And most importantly, we got government out of the way and let the private sector do what it does best: grow our economy and create jobs.We've done it in Nebraska, and I know we can do the same thing in Washington, because we only have two options left. We can either continue the same failed policies of the past, or we can begin to make the tough decisions and lead our country responsibly. We have a tremendous opportunity to set our country in a new, more prosperous direction, and it begins in November. Thank you so much, and may God Bless America. ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
