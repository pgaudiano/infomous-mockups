Or are we a country that is resigned to whatever liberty the government decides to dish out? I tell students all the time the only way to fail in America is to quit. I truly believe that.</title></item><item><title>And I know Mitt Romney does too.</title></item><item><title>For four years, Barack Obama has been running from the nation's problems.</title></item><item><title>He hasn't been working to earn reelection.</title></item><item><title>He's been working to earn a spot on the PGA tour.</title></item><item><title>Mitt Romney has spent his entire life finding ways to solve problems.</title></item><item><title>Mitt Romney has never been resigned to what someone else said was possible.</title></item><item><title>He cut his own path.</title></item><item><title>That's why he believes in his heart that America has a future full of opportunity and hope.</title></item><item><title>And that's why when Mitt Romney looks down the road, he sees a country that's ready for a comeback.</title></item><item><title>I firmly believe he's the man to lead it.</title></item><item><title>As we meet here tonight, America is suffering through an economic calamity of truly historic dimensions.</title></item><item><title>Some are calling it the slowest recovery in our nation's entire 236-year history.</title></item><item><title>To call this a recovery is an insult to recoveries.</title></item><item><title>This is not the result of forces beyond our control.</title></item><item><title>It is not the result of some sinister political plot; as some of the more paranoid inhabitants of the left-wing fever swamps would have you believe.</title></item><item><title>It is the result of the policies that Barack Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress spent two full years carefully putting into place, and which they are determined to continue, if they win again.</title></item><item><title>Policies that are meant to gently lull us into a state of lower expectations and diminished dreams.</title></item><item><title>We've gotten a preview of this future over the past few years.</title></item><item><title>We hear the stories every day now. ...the father who puts on a suit every morning and leaves the house so his daughter doesn't know he lost his job. ...the recent college grad facing up to the painful reality that the only door that's open to her after four years of study and a pile of debt is her parents'.
