August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Ron Kaufman Advisor, Romney Ryan Campaign (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012A friend who founded Staples with Mitt Romney once said to me, "The great thing about Mitt Romney is that he makes everyone who is around him greater than they were!" One of the folks that Mitt Romney brought in to help save the Salt Lake Olympics told me, "Every day on the way to work, you would say to yourself ­ that you owed it to Mitt to be better today than you were yesterday!" If ever there was a time that Americans need to be inspired to be better today than yesterday, that time is now. If ever there was a time that we needed someone to inspire us to do great things, that time is now! Today we come together as a party to nominate for president a man who will energize and inspire this country. The time has come for a new day in America. One with more freedom, one filled with more opportunities and jobs, and a lot less debt. That time and that man have met! That moment is now. That man is Mitt Romney!I have the incredible honor of seconding the nomination for Mitt Romney as the next President of the United States! ### Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
