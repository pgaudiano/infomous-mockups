I bring you greetings from the National Federation of Republican Women, an organization of more than 75,000 Republican women from across the nation. As in every recent election, victory in November will depend on our ability to energize and mobilize women voters. Recently, our National Federation conducted a survey of more than 8,500 Republican women and asked them what they want from their government. Number 1: They want less interference and fewer regulations. Number 2: They want the kind of strong, fiscal conservative leadership that only Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan can deliver. We hear a lot from the media about the Republican's "so-called" war against women. Well, which women? Is it the 850,000 women who have lost their jobs under President Obama? Or the women whose family household income has dropped by $4,300 since the President took office? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women lost 92% of all the jobs lost under the Obama Administration. If there is a war against women, it is President Obama who has waged it.</title></item><item><title>Join us in restoring sanity in our government by electing Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan.
