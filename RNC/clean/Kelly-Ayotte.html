<a name="line1">
Live free or Die! 
<p>
<a name="line2">
That's the motto of the great state of New Hampshire. But I believe tonight we all share that view ­ as have generations of Americans before us. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
Like most Americans ­ our family's life changed after 9/11. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
My husband Joe ­ who was on track to be a commercial pilot ­ instead served our great country flying combat missions in Iraq. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
When he returned home from the war ­ he found himself in the same position as so many Americans ­ he needed a job. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
So he started a family business ­ a landscaping and snowplowing company. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
And when I say he ­ I mean we ­ because I spent many a sleepless night shoveling snow. And I'm proud of the fact that in addition to being a United States Senator ­ I'm also pretty good with a snow plow! 
<p>
<a name="line8">
We are no different from most families who take risks starting their own business. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
We borrowed money to pursue our dreams. And believe me, there was no guarantee of success. We certainly were not too big to fail ­ we had to make it work. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
Yet through all the hard work and sacrifice ­ we pulled together as a family. As the business grew so did our extended family. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
And I speak to you tonight with great concern ­ for our employees ­ their families ­ my family ­ and your family. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
My concern is that President Obama is making it very difficult for small businesses to get started ­ to create jobs ­ and to survive. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
I hear this all the time from the small business owners I speak with. They want to focus on their business. The Obama Administration wants to bury them with rules, regulations and red tape. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
From the National Labor Relations Board ­ to the Department of Labor ­ to the EPA. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
Under this Administration, the regulations are up ­ and the job creation is down. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
President Obama's view is clear: he actually believes that as a family business grows ­ the federal government should take a larger share of its earnings. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
That's punishment for expanding and creating more jobs. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
I call it a "success tax." 
<p>
<a name="line19">
And the very best example is Obamacare. 
<p>
<a name="line20">
Let me tell you what I hear in the real world about Obamacare. 
<p>
<a name="line21">
Just a couple of months ago ­ a successful restaurant owner in Concord, New Hampshire, told me about his dilemma. He wanted to open up a second restaurant ­ and hire more employees. 
<p>
<a name="line22">
But he realized that if he did ­ he would trigger penalties under Obamacare and he couldn't afford it. So he never opened up that restaurant. 
<p>
<a name="line23">
Is that what we want for small businesses in America ­ to be afraid to grow because of the government? To face penalties when you create more jobs? 
<p>
<a name="line24">
To be told "you're earning too much"? 
<p>
<a name="line25">
Isn't it time we had a leader who believes that creating jobs ought to be celebrated not penalized? 
<p>
<a name="line26">
That is why Mitt Romney is running for president. 
<p>
<a name="line27">
He'll get the federal government out of the business of small business. 
<p>
<a name="line28">
He'll fight to lower and simplify taxes. 
<p>
<a name="line29">
He'll work to eliminate job-killing red tape. 
<p>
<a name="line30">
And he will roll back Obamacare starting on Day One! 
<p>
<a name="line31">
In both the private sector and as Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney always asked: how can I help small businesses grow, innovate, and compete? 
<p>
<a name="line32">
It's the right question. And it's the question that this Administration never thinks to ask. 
<p>
<a name="line33">
But why should we be surprised? President Obama has never even run a lemonade stand ­ and it shows. 
<p>
<a name="line34">
So what we need to do is clear. For the sake of the future of small business ­ we need to replace Barack Obama. 
<p>
<a name="line35">
We need to replace Barack Obama with Mitt Romney. A man who truly gets it. 
<p>
<a name="line36">
Mitt understands the hopes and dreams of small business owners throughout our great country. 
<p>
<a name="line37">
But don't just take my word for it. I want you to hear directly from someone on the front lines of small business. 
<p>
<a name="line38">
Jack Gilchrist is a small business owner from Hudson, New Hampshire. 
<p>
<a name="line39">
Three generations of his family have used their own hands to build Gilchrist Metal Fabricating. It's a true family business ­ founded over 30 years ago by Jack's father ­ and carried on by Jack and his son. 
<p>
<a name="line40">
Jack Gilchrist is the face of small business in America, and yes he did build it. Please join me in welcoming my friend Jack Gilchrist. 
<p>
