<br>(Remarks as Prepared for Delivery)

</h2>
<h3>August 28, 2012</h3>
<a name="line1">
As Chairman of the Young Republicans National Federation, I hear from young people all over the country, especially back home in Ohio. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
And times are bad under Barack Obama and his leadership. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
The labor force participation is at its lowest level in 30 years. Twenty-three million Americans are unemployed, underemployed, or have stopped looking for work. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
And quite simply, the jobs just aren't there. Household incomes have fallen and their debt has risen. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
We're paying more for healthcare and getting less choice. There's a war on young people, a war on paychecks and a war on our ability to succeed. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
We're working to build our own businesses, struggling to pave our own way, only to learn that, according to this president, we didn't build it. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
But there is hope -- for the change of a new day. Governor Mitt Romney has a plan to get this country back on track and the Young Republicans are excited. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
We're ready for the government to get out of the way so job creators can actually create jobs. We're ready for leadership that leads from the front. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
We're ready for change. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
We're ready to elect Governor Mitt Romney.                                                     ### </body>
