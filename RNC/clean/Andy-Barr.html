Beyond the rolling hills of the Bluegrass, within the depths of steep mountainsides, Kentuckians built a coal industry that powers America. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
But President Obama doesn't care. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
Coal provides Kentuckians with some of the lowest electricity costs in America ­ enabling companies like Toyota to create 7,000 jobs in Georgetown, Kentucky. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
But President Obama doesn't care. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
This year alone, 2,000 Kentucky miners lost their jobs because of Obama's "War on Coal." For every mining job lost, three additional jobs are threatened, including those at Toyota. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
But President Obama doesn't care. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Rarely in history has a single industry been so ruthlessly attacked with so little regard for the people it hurts. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
People like Chris Woods, a young coal miner who took me underground to show me his work. Chris considers himself lucky. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
He still has a job, driving an hour each way, for a 10-hour shift. His paycheck supports his wife, two kids and both sets of parents. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
Chris looked me in the eyes. I'll never forget his words: "Andy, I don't know much about politics, and frankly I don't care about politics. But if you can save my job, I'm for you." 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Chris, I care about your job. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
Mitt Romney cares about your job. And together, we're going to fight to save your job! 
<p>
