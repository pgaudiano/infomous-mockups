In 1982, my husband Grant and I moved from California to Massachusetts, with our newborn son. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
Being a church-going family, we looked for the nearest chapel and soon found ourselves in a congregation led by a clearly bright and capable man, named Mitt Romney. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
I knew Mitt was special from the start. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
We didn't own a dryer, and the day he stopped by to welcome us, I was embarrassed to have laundry hanging all over the house. Mitt wasn't fazed. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
In fact, as we spoke, without a word, he joined me and started helpfully plucking clothes from around the room and folding them. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
By the time Mitt left, not only did I feel welcome, my laundry was done! 
<p>
<a name="line7">
As Grant and I juggled school, jobs, church and family, we grew to love the Romneys. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
They became role-models and friends, and we were honored when Mitt and Ann regularly trusted us to stay with their five rambunctious - but very loving - sons when they traveled. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
It was when our daughter Kate was born three and a half months early that I fully came to appreciate what a great treasure of friendship we had in Mitt and Ann. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
Kate was so tiny and very sick. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Her lungs not yet ready to breathe, her heart unstable, and after suffering a severe brain hemorrhage at three days old, she was teetering on the very edge of life. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
As I sat with her in intensive care, consumed with a mother's worry and fear, dear Mitt came to visit and pray with me. As our clergy, he was one of few visitors allowed. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
I will never forget that when he looked down tenderly at my daughter, his eyes filled with tears, and he reached out gently and stroked her tiny back. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
I could tell immediately that he didn't just see a tangle of plastic and tubes; he saw our beautiful little girl, and he was clearly overcome with compassion for her. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
During the many months Kate was hospitalized, the Romneys often cared for our two-year old son, Peter. They treated him like one of their own, even welcoming him to stay the night when needed. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
When Thanksgiving rolled around, Kate was still struggling for life. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
Brain surgery was scheduled, and the holiday was the furthest thing from our minds. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
I opened my door to find Mitt and his boys, arms loaded with a Thanksgiving feast. 
<p>
<a name="line19">
Of course we were overcome. When I called to thank Ann, she sweetly confessed it had been Mitt's idea, that most of the cooking and chopping had been done by him. 
<p>
<a name="line20">
She and the boys had just happily pitched in. 
<p>
<a name="line21">
Eventually we moved from Boston. Our daughter Kate grew into an amazing girl of faith and love. 
<p>
<a name="line22">
But complications of her birth remained with her, and after 26 years of both miracles and struggle, she passed away just a year and a half ago. 
<p>
<a name="line23">
In the midst of making the final decision to run for President ­ which had to be the most difficult of their lives ­ when they heard of Kate's passing, both Mitt and Ann paused, to personally reach out to extend us sympathy, and express their love. 
<p>
<a name="line24">
It seems to me when it comes to loving our neighbor, we can talk about it, or we can live it. 
<p>
<a name="line25">
The Romney's live it every single day. 
<p>
<a name="line26">
When the world looks at Mitt Romney, they see him as the founder of a successful business, the leader of the Olympics, or a Governor. 
<p>
<a name="line27">
When I see Mitt, I know him to be a loving father, man of faith and caring and compassionate friend. 
<p>
<a name="line28">
It is with great excitement and a renewed hope, to know that our country will be blessed as it is led by a man who is not only so accomplished and capable, but who has devoted his entire life quietly serving others. That man is Mitt Romney. 
<p>
