Imagine, working every day for four years without a paycheck. I did. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
I worked while our children, Jessica and Kevin, played and napped. And after I tucked them into bed, I worked. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
Our first nine months, we had one client -- a client who waited six months to pay us. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
We sustained our business by tapping into our personal credit cards and borrowing against our home. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
The commitments, expenses and the stress kept us up at night, but we were determined to build a successful business. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
And after several years of hard work, long hours, no pay and low pay, we did. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Today, Exhibit Edge employs 20 people and helps businesses grow through trade show marketing. When those businesses grow, they employ people. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
The President said that business owners didn't get there on our own. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
Well, he's wrong. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
We risked everything and succeeded because of our hard work and commitment. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
What President Obama doesn't understand is that when businesses grow, unemployment goes down and people thrive. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
We need a president who understands the value of entrepreneurship. Governor Romney knows and, more importantly, appreciates what it takes to build a successful business, and that's why I'm supporting Mitt Romney.
