Thank you. I'm not your typical politician. I'm a wife. I'm a mother of three grown sons, a rancher, a small business owner and a citizen-legislator. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
Becoming a U.S. Senator has never been an ambition of mine. But over the last four years, I've become dismayed with the record spending, the record debt, and the record unemployment. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
The Obama administration has been out of touch with the American people, and they've driven our country towards the edge of a fiscal cliff. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
We're on track to become the first generation that passes on fewer opportunities to the next. And that is unacceptable. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
But it doesn't have to be this way. I'm running for the U.S. Senate because I know we can do better. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
I've been a Senator in the Nebraska legislature these past eight years. And in Nebraska, we have an unemployment rate of only 4 percent. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
How did we get there? We cut spending. We balance our budget every year. We passed the biggest tax relief package in the history of our state. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
And most importantly, we got government out of the way and let the private sector do what it does best: grow our economy and create jobs. We've done it in Nebraska, and I know we can do the same thing in Washington, because we only have two options left. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
We can either continue the same failed policies of the past, or we can begin to make the tough decisions and lead our country responsibly. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
We have a tremendous opportunity to set our country in a new, more prosperous direction, and it begins in November. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Thank you so much, and may God Bless America.
