<title>We understand ­ just like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan ­ that small businesses are the engines of our economy, so we get government out of their way and let entrepreneurs build their businesses. </title>

<title>Mitt Romney shares an understanding of the solutions North Dakota has developed and is prepared to lead where President Obama has left broken promises.
