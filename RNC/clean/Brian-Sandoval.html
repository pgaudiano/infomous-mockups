<a name="line1">
Thank you. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
I stand here tonight humbled to share with you the story of a nation, a state and of one man. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
It is the story of America itself ­ of courageous, freedom-loving visionaries who believed in the promise of opportunity, rather than the divine right of kings. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
Who dared to dream that anyone could rise above the circumstances of their birth. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
It is also the story of the great Silver State: Battle Born Nevada! 
<p>
<a name="line6">
We joined the Union to help keep Abraham Lincoln in the White House and fulfill the promise of opportunity, as he ended forever the scourge of slavery. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
And, it is my story: the child of working-class Hispanic Americans who has lived the American dream. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
The Proverbs tell us "from small beginnings come great things." My father was one of ten children. My mother and her family lived in a tiny, two-bedroom house in the Southwest. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
When I was a boy, my parents brought us to Nevada in search of opportunity. My first job was cleaning sheep pens. In college, I worked in a hospital cafeteria. I worked my way through law school. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Encouraged by my parents' love for this country, I dreamed of public service. I became a state legislator, a gaming regulator, and attorney general of my state. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
My story could end there, but this is America. And so, in 2005, a simple son of promise was appointed by President Bush, and confirmed by the United States Senate as a federal judge. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
I saw in my courtroom the fulfillment of all that our forefathers sought to create. A nation of laws. A nation of due process and merit and justice for all. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
And, yes, a nation of immigrants. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
One of the greatest duties I performed was to administer the oath of citizenship to new Americans ­ immigrants who embody our dream of opportunity and prosperity. But from the federal bench, I also saw a nation beset on all sides by unprecedented challenges. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
I watched my state's economy falter, stagnate and slide into decline. Nevadans lost their jobs and their homes. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
Nevada was hit hardest by the recession ­ highest unemployment, highest foreclosure rate, highest bankruptcy rate. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
Like so many, I looked around for help. And what did I find? 
<p>
<a name="line19">
A president who promised change, but turned instead to the same tired strategy of ever-larger government. A president who abandoned hope and embraced only blame. 
<p>
<a name="line20">
So I stepped down from a lifetime appointment to make a difference. I ran for governor, was elected and, like Republican governors all across this nation, I chose to make the tough decisions: 
<p>
<a name="line21">
On issues like economic development, education reform and redesigning how state government operates. 
<p>
<a name="line22">
On job creation, and reducing state spending, and eliminating red tape. It hasn't been easy. And we're not through it yet. 
<p>
<a name="line23">
But I have put my faith in the people of my great state ­ because they are the ones who will grow our economy. 
<p>
<a name="line24">
I have seen Hispanic business owners and families from backgrounds -- not unlike my own -- struggle in this economy. 
<p>
<a name="line25">
I have seen young children from all walks of life begin to wonder if their future holds any hope at all. 
<p>
<a name="line26">
Make no mistake: The current administration's failed experiment with big government gets in the way of economic recovery. Their love affair with government regulation is a drag on business confidence. 
<p>
<a name="line27">
From personal experience, I can tell you what will help states like Nevada and families like mine: elect the team that understands how to get America working again. Send Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to the White House! 
<p>
<a name="line28">
This administration sings the siren song that this is all there is. They tell us government is the answer, but we know it's the problem. 
<p>
<a name="line29">
They tell us we didn't build our businesses, but somebody else made it happen. They tell us not to dream but to settle. 
<p>
<a name="line30">
You and I know America is better than that. 
<p>
<a name="line31">
Our national story is one of confronting challenges ­ and winning. We have overcome economic devastation, defeated mighty oppressors and lifted up generation after generation of Americans. 
<p>
<a name="line32">
We can ­ and we will ­ do it again. 
<p>
<a name="line33">
For that is our birthright as members of the American family ­ white, black, Hispanic, Asian, immigrant or descendent of the Founding Fathers themselves. 
<p>
<a name="line34">
We must leave Tampa this week on a mission to remind Americans they deserve more than the status quo. They deserve to dream big. 
<p>
<a name="line35">
We must remind Americans that the promise of opportunity remains unbroken ­ that every person in this great nation can succeed through hard work, courage and personal responsibility. 
<p>
<a name="line36">
For that is the real American story. 
<p>
<a name="line37">
Thank you. 
<p>
<a name="line38">
And now, let me introduce to you one of those Hispanic business owners that I mentioned are struggling in this economy, Mr. Phil Archuletta of New Mexico. 
<p>
