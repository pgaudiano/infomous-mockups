U.S. Senator, Ohio

	<title>Good evening America, and hello to the fired-up delegation from the Buckeye State right in front of me. </title>

<title>My name is Rob Portman and they say I was on Governor Romney's short list of vice presidential candidates. </title>

<title>Apparently, it wasn't short enough. </title>

<item>
<title>But it's been a great convention and I am delighted to be here tonight to talk about the fundamental differences between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama when it comes to understanding our economy. </title>

<item>
<title>Let's begin by talking about something the Democrats love to demonize - Mitt Romney's success in the private sector. He built a company from the ground up, created lots of jobs, and yes, he made money. </title>

<title>He made it the old fashioned way . . . He earned it. </title>

</item>


<item>
<title>Then you have Barack Obama, who has never started a business--never even worked in business. And he claims those who have should give credit to the government or someone else for their success. </title>
	<link>http://www.infomous.com/site/mockups/RNC/clean/Rob-Portman-Wednesday-FINAL.html#line7</link>
	<author>The Hon. Rob Portman</author>
</item>


<item>
<title>So, you have one candidate who understands that success comes from working hard, competing and taking risks. </title>
	<link>http://www.infomous.com/site/mockups/RNC/clean/Rob-Portman-Wednesday-FINAL.html#line8</link>
	<author>The Hon. Rob Portman</author>
</item>


<item>
<title>And you have another candidate who believes success comes from government. </title>

<title>Which one do you think knows how to turn this economy around? </title>

<item>
<title>Which one would you choose to invest your life's savings? Should it be any different for safeguarding our nation's economy? </title>

<title>Or let's say you don't have any savings. Let's say you're worried about how to pay September's rent or mortgage. </title>

<title>You've gotta be running out of patience ­ and hope. You have to be tired, looking for a new start. </title>

<item>
<title>Well, you don't have to be patient any longer. Through your vote this fall you can change the leadership of this country and the opportunities for you and your family. </title>

<title>Governor Romney had a plan to build his business. He now has a detailed plan to restore our economy and strengthen the middle class. </title>

<item>
<title>Blaming others does not qualify as a plan. Now the president did submit a budget. It was so bad that not a single Republican or a single Democrat in the entire United States Congress would vote for it. </title>

<item>
<title>He got zero votes. That is a failure of leadership. President Obama has been right about at least one prediction he's made about the economy. He said, "If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition." </title>

<title>It hasn't worked, because you cannot spend your way, regulate your way, tax your way or blame your way out of the economic mess we are in. </title>

<title>In contrast, President Obama is the first president in 75 years--Democrat or Republican--who hasn't even sought the ability to negotiate export agreements and open markets overseas. Now why is this important? </title>

<title>Because 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside our borders. And to create jobs, our workers and our farmers need to sell more of what we make to those people. </title>

<title>While this administration has been dragging its feet, other countries have been busy negotiating hundreds of new trade agreements to benefit their workers and their farmers, taking away our opportunities. </title>

<title>President Obama has been so driven to advance his big government ideology that he has abandoned the daily economic work that a government must do to open markets, restore business confidence and create the climate for job growth. </title>

<title>Take trade with China. China manipulates its currency giving it an unfair trade advantage. So why doesn't the president do something about it? </title>

<title>I'll tell you one reason ­ President Obama could not run up his record trillion dollar deficits if the Chinese did not buy our bonds to finance them. </title>

<title>We need to reform our outdated and complicated tax code. We need to fix our burdensome regulatory system and we need an energy policy that encourages development of our resources right here, in the ground, in America. America has a choice between Mitt Romney, who seeks to grow the economy, and Barack Obama who seeks to redistribute it. </title>

<title>I have seen that dream up close. When I was a kid, my dad left his job as a salesman and started his own business selling forklift trucks. My Mom was the bookkeeper. He had to borrow money from her uncle because the bank wouldn't give him a loan. He lost money for the first few years, but he never lost his dream. </title>

<title>About a year into the Obama Administration ­ I asked my dad whether he would do it again. He said, "Rob ­ with all the uncertainty out there today ­ I don't know if I would take the risk." </title>

<title>In that one sentence, he summed up what I've heard from hundreds of small business owners across Ohio and around this great country. They're afraid to make the investment and jobs are the casualty. Ladies and gentlemen, we need new leadership and new policies to bring back the dream and renew America's promise. </title>
