<br>(Remarks as Prepared for Delivery)

<a name="line1">
Fellow delegates, Mr. Chairman: 
<p>
<a name="line2">
It's been an honor to chair the deliberations of your Committee on Resolutions of the Republican platform committee. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
I appreciate the diligent work of the 112 men and women from 50 states and six territories who served on that committee. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
They discussed, debated and delivered. It was a good team. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
I want to thank my co-chairs, Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
And I thank the staff of the RNC who conducted countless meetings and conference calls to compose this document. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
We have outlined a conservative vision of governance, a document that is many things--an indictment, a blueprint and a declaration of values. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
It is an invitation and a pledge. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
First, it is an indictment of the failed policies of the current administration's record of debt, job losses and government overreach. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
More importantly, our platform is a blueprint for rebuilding the cherished American dream. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
It is an overview of our conservative principles and detailed policies for how we jumpstart economic growth and job creation. This ambitious blueprint projects a sea change in the way government works. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
It offers solutions for workers without jobs, families without savings and neighborhoods without hope. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
This platform addresses the elderly who are worried about Medicare. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
It tells the truth about Obamacare and the need to repeal and replace it. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
This blueprint lays out a bold agenda for government reform -- a government that operates to serve the people better at less cost. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
States are going to take center stage in the long-overdue renewal of American society. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
By reclaiming management of education. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
By reforming Medicaid and welfare programs. 
<p>
<a name="line19">
By managing environmental problems locally. 
<p>
<a name="line20">
By enacting a comprehensive energy policy. 
<p>
<a name="line21">
This platform affirms the traditional meaning of marriage and the sanctity of human life, defends religious freedom and Second Amendment rights and calls for a balanced budget amendment. 
<p>
<a name="line22">
This platform is an invitation. It invites every American to consider what kind of country we want to be. 
<p>
<a name="line23">
An America where every person matters, every worker has an opportunity to work and every family can aspire to a better future. 
<p>
<a name="line24">
We invite Americans to consider this platform: a call for dramatic change in government, from stagnation to prosperity, from an entitlement society to an opportunity society. 
<p>
<a name="line25">
This platform is a pledge. 
<p>
<a name="line26">
We will restore American leadership in the world and honor our courageous men and women in uniform. 
<p>
<a name="line27">
We will stand by our friends and stand against those who dare to harm us. 
<p>
<a name="line28">
That is your platform. I urge its adoption. It is now my great pleasure to introduce one of my co-chairs of the platform committee, the outstanding senator and former governor from the state of North Dakota, John Hoeven. Please give him a warm welcome! 
<p>
<a name="line29">
