Greetings from Virginia, where the American story began. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
What started with entrepreneurs arriving in Jamestown in 1607 ­ and grew with the wisdom of Washington, Jefferson, Madison ­ shaped a nation and the world. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
Lovers of freedom and liberty, members of all races and religions ­ from across the globe ­ now live and prosper in Virginia, which is rated one of the best places to live, work, start a business, and raise a family. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
Over the past four years, we in Virginia have kept the American Dream alive by observing the President's policies ­ and DOING THE OPPOSITE. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
If reelected, President Obama would double down on his job-destroying policies: 
<p>
<a name="line6">
·He promises to raise our taxes and hurt working families. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
·He mocks our right-to-work laws. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
·His budget failure threatens to slash 200,000 national security and high-tech jobs in Virginia. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
·His war on success undermines individual initiative and innovation. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
Obama isn't working. President Mitt Romney and Vice President Paul Ryan WILL. They have a common-sense plan to reward and unleash our entrepreneurs and innovators and put America back to work. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
They will be unapologetic in championing the American Dream. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
In 70 days, let's renew our Founding Fathers' victory for freedom. Let's guarantee that our children and their children continue this American story of freedom, opportunity and prosperity for all. 
<p>
