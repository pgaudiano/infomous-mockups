Hello fellow patriots! 
<p>
<a name="line2">
As an actress, I have worked on movie sets all across our great land, from New York to Los Angeles, from Miami to Seattle. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
As a constitutionalist, I have traversed America, visiting classrooms and town halls, from Ohio to Arizona, from Colorado to Wisconsin. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
What I have witnessed is the splendor of American ingenuity, the triumph of American tenacity and the goodness of the American heart. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
And President Obama, I'm here to tell ya, the government didn't build it. God and the American people built it! 
<p>
<a name="line6">
And while we are at it, I stand here as witness ­ America is exceptional. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
America's entrepreneurship was fostered by our Founding Fathers' vision of a Republic ­ a small government, limited by the Constitution's enumerated powers. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
Speaking of our republic, when Benjamin Franklin was walking out of Independence Hall after signing the Constitution, a woman approached him and said, "Sir, what form of government have you given us?" Franklin replied, "A republic, ma'am, if you can keep it!" 
<p>
<a name="line9">
I believe the best way to keep it ­ our republican form of government ­ is with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan! Our Constitution guarantees us a republican form of government in Article 4 Section 4. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
But our liberal brethren don't feel constrained by our Constitution. That's convenient for them. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
By ignoring Constitutional limits, they do whatever they like ­ grow the government to unbelievable and unsustainable heights, and accumulate historic, catastrophic debt. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
Patrick Henry said, "Give me liberty or give me death." Today Obama enables an entitlement society that says, "Give me liberty and gimme, gimme!" 
<p>
<a name="line13">
Why? Because democrats depend on dependence. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
America was not born with a gimme, gimme mentality, and American liberty cannot survive with a gimme, gimme mentality. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
America was built with her hands at work, not with her hands out. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
The torch of the American dream is fueled with the unquenchable desire for independence, liberty and freedom. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
Free enterprise has paved the way for Americans to earn their own success and it has created an America that has yielded an unprecedented level of progress. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
This progress has lifted up humanity to greater heights of living and a greater level of dignity. 
<p>
<a name="line19">
Mitt Romney will preserve this exceptional American legacy. 
<p>
<a name="line20">
Barack Obama will destroy it. 
<p>
<a name="line21">
Obama is stifling the American dream primarily because it isn't HIS dream. 
<p>
<a name="line22">
His dream is not of an independent people. His dream is of a dependent people based upon the failed principles of antiquated governments. 
<p>
<a name="line23">
Mitt Romney will restore the American dream based on three of our tried and true founding principles. 
<p>
<a name="line24">
1) God gives us our rights, not government. If man gives us our rights, then man can take them away. As James Madison forewarned, and history has proven, "men are not angels." 2) The checks and balances of government are paramount: without them, we have tyranny, and tyranny strangles liberty. 
<p>
<a name="line25">
3) The genius of the people will prevail: for the people's voice is the republic, and for the republic Mitt Romney will stand. 
<p>
<a name="line26">
Thank you! 
<p>
