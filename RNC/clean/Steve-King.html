Good evening. In two short months, our country faces a momentous decision. We will decide whether to continue our slide into debt and dependence, or whether to restore opportunity and self-determination. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
I believe, at this time, America is looking for leadership. Americans are searching for substance. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
We are here tonight because Mitt Romney has chosen the first real leader of his generation, a man who can help us believe in America again -- and his name is Paul Ryan! 
<p>
<a name="line4">
We are here tonight, as Republicans, united and excited for a Romney-Ryan presidency! 
<p>
<a name="line5">
I remember talking with Paul when he was weighing his first congressional race. Even at the age of 27, he was a man with big ideas and the courage of his convictions. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
Paul's time in politics has been a family affair. His brother Tobin helped lead Paul's first campaign. His mother Betty and sister-in-law Oakleigh knocked on doors and handed out fliers. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Now Paul is joined by his wife Janna, his daughter Liza, and his sons Charlie and Sam. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
You'll find them in church and later watching a Packers or Brewers game, or swapping hunting and fishing stories with family. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
From his very first campaign, Paul Ryan asked voters directly: "Hire me." And has since always reminded his constituents: "Remember, I work for you!" 
<p>
<a name="line10">
He never forgets who he works for. And no one has been more diligent and effective in working for the good of Wisconsin and America. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Paul Ryan has the courage to tell the truth ­ even when the truth is hard to hear. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
Paul Ryan has big, thoughtful ideas. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
Paul Ryan has the determination to tackle tough challenges ­ even those that others choose to ignore. Paul Ryan is the leader we need at this critical moment in our nation's history. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
Mitt Romney believes that. Do we? 
<p>
<a name="line15">
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my singular great honor and distinct privilege to nominate my good friend, my fellow citizen of Janesville, Wisconsin, a genuinely good man from the Midwest -- Paul D. Ryan -- to be vice president of the United States of America! 
<p>
<a name="line16">
Thank you! 
<p>
