	<title>Thank you. I'm not your typical politician. I'm a wife. I'm a mother of three grown sons, a rancher, a small business owner and a citizen-legislator. </title>

<title>Becoming a U.S. Senator has never been an ambition of mine. But over the last four years, I've become dismayed with the record spending, the record debt, and the record unemployment. </title>

<title>But it doesn't have to be this way. I'm running for the U.S. Senate because I know we can do better. </title>

<title>I've been a Senator in the Nebraska legislature these past eight years. And in Nebraska, we have an unemployment rate of only 4 percent. </title>
