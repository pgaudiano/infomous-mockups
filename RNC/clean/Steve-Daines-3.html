Thank you. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
In 1984, as a young delegate from the great state of Montana, I cast my vote for President Ronald Reagan in Dallas. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
For the past 28 years, I have built businesses and created hundreds of jobs. My wife Cindy and I have been married for 25 years and are the parents of four great kids. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
Now, out-of-control spending, crushing debt, and job-destroying regulations threaten our children's future. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
We have more government than ever before. Our economy is stagnant, families are struggling, and the America we love is threatened. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
Washington does NOT create jobs, the people do. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
I'm grateful that six generations of my family have called Montana home. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
My great-great grandmother left Norway and came to Montana in search of a better future. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
As a widow with seven children, she homesteaded on the plains of northern Montana. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
On her tombstone are three simple words: "Saved by Grace." 
<p>
<a name="line11">
The words "Saved by Government" would never have crossed her mind. She put her faith in God not Government. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
In 70 days, our country faces a pivotal election -- and our choice is clear. We can do better and we will do better when we elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Thank you and God bless. 
<p>
