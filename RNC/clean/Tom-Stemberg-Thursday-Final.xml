<item>
	<title>Twenty-five years ago I had a crazy idea for a new business. </title>

<title>I wanted to do to office supplies what Home Depot had done with home improvement. I pictured an office superstore for regular customers and small businesses. The business would be called Staples. </title>

<item>
<title>It wasn't easy at first. I had a vision and a business plan. </title>

<item>
<title>Then I met Mitt Romney. He helped make it come alive. </title>

<item>
<title>Now Mitt was an unusual guy. He had already enjoyed great success at Bain & Company. But he knew the value of a dollar. </title>

<item>
<title>When I told him about Staples, he really got excited at the idea of saving a few cents on paper clips. </title>

<item>
<title>But I ask you. Who would make a better president: Someone who knows how to save a dollar on pens and paper or someone who knows how to waste $535 million on Solyndra? </title>

<title>The truth is Mitt was not a typical investor. He was a true partner. Where some saw an unproven new business, he saw a store that could save people money. He recognized that efficiency creates consumer value. </title>

<item>
<title>He never looked at Staples as merely a financial investment. He saw the engine of prosperity it could become. </title>

<title>Today Staples employs nearly 90,000 people. It has over 2,000 stores. Over 50 distribution centers. It is part of a competitive industry that helps entrepreneurs and small businesses get started on their own. For me, as a founder, it was the realization of a dream. </title>

<item>
<title>So you can imagine my dismay, when I see this White House and their campaign demonizing Mitt Romney. Demonizing Bain Capital. Demonizing the private equity industry that created so many new jobs. </title>

<title>Over and over again: Fiction. Half truths. Down-right lies. </title>

<item>
<title>You have to ask yourself: why would an Administration that can't create any jobs demonize someone who did? </title>

<title>I think when it comes to jobs, new businesses, and economic growth ­ they just don't get it. </title>

<title>The night before we opened the first store, I asked our people to do back-to-back all-nighters. </title>

<item>
<title>That's when I got a call from Mitt. He wanted to come over and talk with the team, spend time with them. He told me in very clear terms: This business is all about the people. </title>

<title>Most people didn't give the business a chance. It went for five straight years without making a profit ­ but Mitt and Bain Capital stood by them. </title>

<title>The Obama campaign will tell you that Bain Capital was a form of "Vampire Capitalism." Drain the blood from a company and move on. They just don't get it. </title>

<title>They don't get it because they don't believe in the spirit of the entrepreneur. They don't understand what it means to risk money to create something new. </title>

<title>They don't understand the hard work it takes to get a business off the ground. The sacrifices you make, the Little League games you miss. </title>

<title>They don't see that this is a country of opportunity, where someone like myself, the son of immigrants born in Newark, New Jersey ­ and proud of it, Governor Christie ­ can live the American dream. </title>
