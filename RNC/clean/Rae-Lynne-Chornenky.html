<br>(Remarks as Prepared for Delivery)

<a name="line1">
Thank you. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
I bring you greetings from the National Federation of Republican Women, an organization of more than 75,000 Republican women from across the nation. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
As in every recent election, victory in November will depend on our ability to energize and mobilize women voters. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
Recently, our National Federation conducted a survey of more than 8,500 Republican women and asked them what they want from their government. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
Number 1: They want less interference and fewer regulations. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
Number 2: They want the kind of strong, fiscal conservative leadership that only Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan can deliver. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
We hear a lot from the media about the Republican's "so-called" war against women. Well, which women? 
<p>
<a name="line8">
Is it the 850,000 women who have lost their jobs under President Obama? 
<p>
<a name="line9">
Or the women whose family household income has dropped by $4,300 since the President took office? 
<p>
<a name="line10">
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women lost 92% of all the jobs lost under the Obama Administration. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
If there is a war against women, it is President Obama who has waged it. Join us in restoring sanity in our government by electing Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
Thank you.
