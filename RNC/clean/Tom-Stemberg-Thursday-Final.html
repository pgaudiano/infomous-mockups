<a name="line1">
Twenty-five years ago I had a crazy idea for a new business. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
I wanted to do to office supplies what Home Depot had done with home improvement. I pictured an office superstore for regular customers and small businesses. The business would be called Staples. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
It wasn't easy at first. I had a vision and a business plan. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
Then I met Mitt Romney. He helped make it come alive. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
Now Mitt was an unusual guy. He had already enjoyed great success at Bain & Company. But he knew the value of a dollar. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
When I told him about Staples, he really got excited at the idea of saving a few cents on paper clips. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Funny thing. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
But I ask you. Who would make a better president: Someone who knows how to save a dollar on pens and paper or someone who knows how to waste $535 million on Solyndra? 
<p>
<a name="line9">
The truth is Mitt was not a typical investor. He was a true partner. Where some saw an unproven new business, he saw a store that could save people money. He recognized that efficiency creates consumer value. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
He never looked at Staples as merely a financial investment. He saw the engine of prosperity it could become. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Today Staples employs nearly 90,000 people. It has over 2,000 stores. Over 50 distribution centers. It is part of a competitive industry that helps entrepreneurs and small businesses get started on their own. For me, as a founder, it was the realization of a dream. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
So you can imagine my dismay, when I see this White House and their campaign demonizing Mitt Romney. Demonizing Bain Capital. Demonizing the private equity industry that created so many new jobs. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
Over and over again: Fiction. Half truths. Down-right lies. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
You have to ask yourself: why would an Administration that can't create any jobs demonize someone who did? 
<p>
<a name="line15">
I've got a theory. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
I think when it comes to jobs, new businesses, and economic growth ­ they just don't get it. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
They say that Mitt Romney is out of touch with ordinary Americans. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
They just don't get it. 
<p>
<a name="line19">
The night before we opened the first store, I asked our people to do back-to-back all-nighters. 
<p>
<a name="line20">
That's when I got a call from Mitt. He wanted to come over and talk with the team, spend time with them. He told me in very clear terms: This business is all about the people. 
<p>
<a name="line21">
But this Obama-Biden campaign; they just don't get it. 
<p>
<a name="line22">
They will tell you that private equity is focused only on the short-term. 
<p>
<a name="line23">
Tell that to the founders of Bright Horizons Day Care, a company that has transformed corporate day care. 
<p>
<a name="line24">
Most people didn't give the business a chance. It went for five straight years without making a profit ­ but Mitt and Bain Capital stood by them. 
<p>
<a name="line25">
Mitt and Bain Capital believed in the vision. 
<p>
<a name="line26">
They understood how important it was for women to join the workforce and have on-site care for their children. It was an overdue revolution in the American workplace. 
<p>
<a name="line27">
Today the company employs over 19,000 people. 
<p>
<a name="line28">
But President Obama and his friends, they just don't get it. 
<p>
<a name="line29">
The Obama campaign will tell you that Bain Capital was a form of "Vampire Capitalism." Drain the blood from a company and move on. They just don't get it. 
<p>
<a name="line30">
Where were they when Mitt stayed with Staples for 15 years ­ long after Bain Capital had sold its stock? 
<p>
<a name="line31">
Where were they when Bain Capital helped start Steel Dynamics, when most people had given up on the American steel industry? 
<p>
<a name="line32">
Eighteen years later that company employs 6,000 people. 
<p>
<a name="line33">
But this administration they just don't get it. 
<p>
<a name="line34">
They've got a Jobs Council that never meets. 
<p>
<a name="line35">
A Democratic Senate that doesn't act. 
<p>
<a name="line36">
A President who doesn't believe and a Vice President who won't stop talking. 
<p>
<a name="line37">
They just don't get it. 
<p>
<a name="line38">
They don't get it because they don't believe in the spirit of the entrepreneur. They don't understand what it means to risk money to create something new. 
<p>
<a name="line39">
They don't understand the hard work it takes to get a business off the ground. The sacrifices you make, the Little League games you miss. 
<p>
<a name="line40">
They don't see that this is a country of opportunity, where someone like myself, the son of immigrants born in Newark, New Jersey ­ and proud of it, Governor Christie ­ can live the American dream. 
<p>
<a name="line41">
Well, let me tell you: my friend Mitt Romney gets it. 
<p>
<a name="line42">
And I could not be more confident in saying that the American people get it. 
<p>
<a name="line43">
That's why, this November, they will elect Mitt Romney as the next President of the United States of America. 
<p>
