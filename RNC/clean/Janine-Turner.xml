<title>Speaking of our republic, when Benjamin Franklin was walking out of Independence Hall after signing the Constitution, a woman approached him and said, "Sir, what form of government have you given us?" Franklin replied, "A republic, ma'am, if you can keep it!" </title>

<title>I believe the best way to keep it ­ our republican form of government ­ is with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan! Our Constitution guarantees us a republican form of government in Article 4 Section 4. </title>

<title>By ignoring Constitutional limits, they do whatever they like ­ grow the government to unbelievable and unsustainable heights, and accumulate historic, catastrophic debt. </title>

<title>Patrick Henry said, "Give me liberty or give me death." Today Obama enables an entitlement society that says, "Give me liberty and gimme, gimme!" </title>

<title>America was not born with a gimme, gimme mentality, and American liberty cannot survive with a gimme, gimme mentality. </title>

<title>1) God gives us our rights, not government. If man gives us our rights, then man can take them away. As James Madison forewarned, and history has proven, "men are not angels." 2) The checks and balances of government are paramount: without them, we have tyranny, and tyranny strangles liberty. </title>

<title>3) The genius of the people will prevail: for the people's voice is the republic, and for the republic Mitt Romney will stand. </title>
