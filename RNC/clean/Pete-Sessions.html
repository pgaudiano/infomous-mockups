<a name="line1">
Good afternoon. I'm Pete Sessions, a Congressman from Dallas, Texas and the Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
I'm delighted to be here with our team. Our delegates sell the fight every day, in every community across the country, as we stand up to make Barack Obama a one-term president. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
In 2008, I declared that we would retire Nancy Pelosi ­ and the pundits laughed. I traveled the country recruiting community leaders who, like their neighbors, were concerned for the future of America under the Pelosi-Obama regime. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
Together, we retired Nancy Pelosi and brought common-sense to the House by placing the gavel firmly in Speaker Boehner's hands. The fight didn't stop there. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
The Republican message that won us the majority in 2010 ­ implementing free enterprise policies that create jobs, cutting spending and repealing Obamacare ­ will continue to allow us to grow our House Majority, to take back the Senate and make Mitt Romney the next President of the United States. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
We have a diverse group of competitive candidates this cycle ­ our lead salesmen ­ that will boost the Romney-Ryan ticket. These candidates, many of whom you will hear from shortly, have the will to win. They are on offense to defeat big-government Democrats. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Thank you for all you do to help us in our fight to rebuild the American Dream and God Bless America! 
<p>
