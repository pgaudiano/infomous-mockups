Hello Tampa! 
<p>
<a name="line2">
Hello delegates! 
<p>
<a name="line3">
I am a proud member of the Party of Reagan, Romney and Ryan. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
As a father of six, my biggest worry is that our children are losing their shot at the American Dream. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
Today, record unemployment is dashing the dreams of our college graduates: instead of moving onto their dream jobs, they're moving into their parents' basement. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
The debt we're passing off to our kids is a shameful legacy. And Obama's big government policies have made this the worst recovery since the Great Depression. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
This is not a liberal problem. It's not a conservative problem. This economy is America's problem! 
<p>
<a name="line8">
Obama's quest to spread the wealth has only managed to spread the misery. We have a better idea. Let's spread the economic growth! 
<p>
<a name="line9">
And we will spread it from the breweries of Wisconsin to the barrios of California. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
If you voted for Obama and you have buyer's remorse, let me tell you, Mitt Romney is the hope and Paul Ryan is the change. A vote for Romney / Ryan is a vote for a dream ticket -- a dream ticket that will end the Obama economic nightmare. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
It is a vote for fiscal sanity and responsibility to Washington. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
And it is a vote to put AMERICA back to work! 
<p>
<a name="line13">
Let's get it done! 
<p>
<a name="line14">
