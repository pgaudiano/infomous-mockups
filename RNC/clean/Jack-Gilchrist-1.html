<a name="line1">
Thank you very much, Senator. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
I'm glad to have you as a champion of small business for New Hampshire. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
Like many small businessmen, my dad borrowed against our house to purchase the machinery to start Gilchrist Metal Fabricating. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
Machines making equipment for drilling oil, generating power, broadcasting television, processing food and many other industries. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
Machines run by taxpaying Americans. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
We employ about 40 people, most of them with families, including my son Stuart. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Though we have enjoyed success, we face more global pressure every day. So do our suppliers and customers. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
If we don't continually improve and streamline our processes to stay efficient, we will lose out to our competition. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
We don't have a choice. Often the decisions we make are difficult. Running a business means taking responsibility: 
<p>
<a name="line10">
               Presenting a certain future to the management team.                Developing a functional budget.                Insuring that we have adequate supplies.                Making a commitment to fulfill our customer's orders on time. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Sure, there are things which I cannot control. But running the business is my job and mine alone. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
I blame no one else for the challenges we face. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
I am often reminded of something Lee Iacocca said: "lead, follow or get out of the way." 
<p>
<a name="line14">
Everyone who runs a business understands this. Everyone but our federal government. They won't lead. Their rules and regulations are too hard to follow. And they won't get out of our way. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
This Administration is killing us out here. Small business needs a leader. A leader who understands the entire spectrum of business and industry. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
A leader who can work with all parties involved. A leader who will not avoid dealing with difficult issues. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
A leader with the experience to understand what it takes. A leader who is in touch with America's small businesses. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
Mitt Romney is exactly that leader. 
<p>
<a name="line19">
Thank you! 
<p>
