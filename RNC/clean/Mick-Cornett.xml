<title>It's becoming more and more unusual for our best and brightest to leave the state, but in this case we're glad it's worked out the way it has. We're enjoying a renaissance in Oklahoma City. </title>

<title>Oklahoma City was recently named as the most entrepreneurial city in the country, with the most start-ups per capita. Interestingly, we have NOT done this by creating large amounts of debt. We did something unique for many of our infrastructure packages: we paid cash. </title>
