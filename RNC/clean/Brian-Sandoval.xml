<title>It is the story of America itself ­ of courageous, freedom-loving visionaries who believed in the promise of opportunity, rather than the divine right of kings. </title>

<title>We joined the Union to help keep Abraham Lincoln in the White House and fulfill the promise of opportunity, as he ended forever the scourge of slavery. </title>

<title>Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life. </title>

<title>When I was a boy, my parents brought us to Nevada in search of opportunity. My first job was cleaning sheep pens. In college, I worked in a hospital cafeteria. I worked my way through law school. </title>

<title>Encouraged by my parents' love for this country, I dreamed of public service. I became a state legislator, a gaming regulator, and attorney general of my state. </title>

<title>My story could end there, but this is America. And so, in 2005, a simple son of promise was appointed by President Bush, and confirmed by the United States Senate as a federal judge. </title>

<title>One of the greatest duties I performed was to administer the oath of citizenship to new Americans ­ immigrants who embody our dream of opportunity and prosperity. But from the federal bench, I also saw a nation beset on all sides by unprecedented challenges. </title>

<title>Make no mistake: The current administration's failed experiment with big government gets in the way of economic recovery. Their love affair with government regulation is a drag on business confidence. </title>

<title>From personal experience, I can tell you what will help states like Nevada and families like mine: elect the team that understands how to get America working again. Send Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to the White House! </title>
