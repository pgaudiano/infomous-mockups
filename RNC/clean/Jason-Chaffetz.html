America is in trouble. If you spent $1 million every day, it would take you almost 3,000 years to get to $1 trillion. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
We are now nearly $16 trillion in debt. Each day we pay more than $600 million in interest on that debt - and we deficit spend $3 billion a day. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
Excessive regulations choke businesses. Our tax code punishes success, discourages entrepreneurs, and stifles growth. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
President Obama's solution: more government and more taxes. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
This isn't the American Dream. Our nation isn't just one good tax increase away from prosperity. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
American success hasn't come from Czars, "Cash for Clunkers," endless bailouts, a limitless government credit card, or more taxes for more government. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
The American Dream was built on the sweat and blood of Americans who took pride and personal ownership in themselves and their country. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
When times were tough, generations before quietly rolled up their sleeves and built a stronger, more prosperous nation. The government didn't build it. They built it. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
America was built with hard work, dedication to principles, and a belief that success was predicated on liberty and ownership. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
Restoring the American Dream will require fiscal discipline, limited government, accountability, and a strong national defense. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
We need to make tough choices. We need leadership. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
We need to elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. We need to believe in America again. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
Thank you.
