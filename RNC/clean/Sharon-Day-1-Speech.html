<a name="line1">
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
Welcome everyone to my home State of Florida! 
<p>
<a name="line3">
We are honored to host you and I am honored to serve as the RNC Co-Chair. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
Every election we hear that this is the most important election of our lifetime. This election is more than that. It is the most important election in our nation's lifetime. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
In 1775 our Founding Fathers rose up to establish our liberty. Today, we need to defeat a President whose actions threaten our liberty! 
<p>
<a name="line6">
In this way, we are in a similar position as our Founding Fathers. Just as they were called upon, we are being called upon. What they started, what they believed in, we must defend! 
<p>
<a name="line7">
The danger for America is already here, in the form of the Democratic leaders in Washington. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
We have a Democrat Senate leader who refuses to meet his moral obligation to pass a budget for the government. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
We have a Democrat House leader that wouldn't allow a major piece of legislation--Obama Care--to be read before it was passed. She stated to the world, and I quote "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it." 
<p>
<a name="line10">
We have a President that has bypassed the Senate confirmation process in order to appoint unaccountable czars to make and enforce policies on America's citizens. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
A President that by executive action has changed immigration laws, imposed unconstitutional burdens on our states, and issued over-reaching regulations. We know the problem, America--their names are Obama ­ Biden ­ Reid ­ Pelosi ­ Holder. What they have done--and will continue to do, should Obama be re-elected--runs contrary to the values we believe in and the principles we stand for. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
It is our duty, as citizen activists, of this great Republican Party, to fight to restore the values of our Founding Fathers. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
My fellow members, this fight is not just about an election, and it is not about our party. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
Our fight is about our country, and we must not lose! 
<p>
<a name="line15">
Our Founding Fathers made huge personal sacrifices for what they believed in. The time is now for us to do the same! 
<p>
<a name="line16">
I am a proud grassroots activist, one of many in my state and countless others from across the country. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
Today we need as many grassroots activists from all walks of life and throughout this great nation to stand with us. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
The sacrifices we need to make are nothing compared to the sacrifices our children and our grandchildren will face if we don't take back our country on November 6th. 
<p>
<a name="line19">
We must take this election house-by-house, precinct-by-precinct, city-by-city, state-by-state, to bring our proud conservative message of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to every voter. 
<p>
<a name="line20">
When we leave Florida in a few days, let's commit ourselves to give all that we can to help the Romney/Ryan ticket. 
<p>
<a name="line21">
Together, let's make history. Together, let's defeat Barack Obama. 
<p>
<a name="line22">
Together, let's save our country for the next generation. 
<p>
<a name="line23">
Thank you. God bless each of you. God bless our proud military and their families and may God continue to bless the United States of America.                                                ### </body>
