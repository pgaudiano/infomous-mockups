<br>(Remarks as Prepared for Delivery)

</h2>
<h3>August 28, 2012</h3>
<a name="line1">
Good evening. My name is Sher Valenzuela. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
Two years ago, I never would have imagined that I would be here tonight, speaking at the Republican National Convention. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
I've seen these on TV ­ what an honor to be here with you. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
I'm a mother from Delaware, a co-owner with my husband of First State Manufacturing. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
And after this November, I plan on taking on a new title: the next Lieutenant Governor of the Great State of Delaware. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
Tonight, it is my honor to talk about the three themes that inspired me to run for office: 
<p>
<a name="line7">
        My family. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
        The business we built. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
        And my belief in America's unlimited potential. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
But it starts with a wonderful story. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Shortly after our son was born, my husband and I received some news that would change our lives forever. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
We learned that our son Simon was autistic. We loved him with every fiber in our being. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
But the "experts" told us not to expect much. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
"Your son will never learn to read, write, or communicate effectively," they said. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
"Accept these limits," they seemed to say. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
It was a tough time. We quickly realized that the jobs we had wouldn't pay for the professionals Simon needed to overcome the odds. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
So we followed a deep and long-standing American tradition. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
We took a risk. 
<p>
<a name="line19">
We bet on the future. 
<p>
<a name="line20">
We started our own business. 
<p>
<a name="line21">
When he was serving in the Army, my husband had taken a mail order course on upholstery. 
<p>
<a name="line22">
One day I came home to find him pulling out the second hand sewing machine he'd learned his craft on. 
<p>
<a name="line23">
He called her "Old Betsy." 
<p>
<a name="line24">
A second-generation Mexican-American, my husband will do whatever it takes to provide for his family. 
<p>
<a name="line25">
Our friends thought we were crazy. Didn't we have enough challenges trying to raise Simon? 
<p>
<a name="line26">
Why not just accept our lot in life? 
<p>
<a name="line27">
That's when I remembered something my dad used to say. 
<p>
<a name="line28">
My dad was an old school guy. A former drill sergeant. Blue collar union worker his whole life. 
<p>
<a name="line29">
He taught us to work hard and think big. I remember he once pulled off the road and pointed at a big factory. 
<p>
<a name="line30">
"That's more than a building," he told me. 
<p>
<a name="line31">
"It took a lot of work to get that big. It started out as just an idea at some guy's kitchen table." 
<p>
<a name="line32">
I guess you could say our upholstery business was OUR kitchen table idea. 
<p>
<a name="line33">
Fifteen years later we employ more than 70 people in our 70,000 square foot factory. 
<p>
<a name="line34">
And we're so proud of what we do. 
<p>
<a name="line35">
We make umpire vests for Little Leagues. 
<p>
<a name="line36">
Products for the men and women serving our country. 
<p>
<a name="line37">
Restaurant seats for pizza chains. 
<p>
<a name="line38">
And protective gear for our allies in the Israeli military. 
<p>
<a name="line39">
We're actually taking work away from Chinese and Mexican competitors ­ and bringing it back to Delaware! 
<p>
<a name="line40">
How did it happen? We defied the odds. 
<p>
<a name="line41">
We rolled the dice on losing ­ or gaining ­ everything. We didn't listen to the experts. We grew our dream. 
<p>
<a name="line42">
And with our son Simon, we didn't listen to the experts either. 
<p>
<a name="line43">
Yes, he still struggles with autism. But this past June, he completed his first year at the University of Delaware. 
<p>
<a name="line44">
I can't tell you how much this means to him ­ and how much it means to me, the mom of a special needs child. 
<p>
<a name="line45">
Raising our family and building our business have been the passions of our lives, and what struck me is how similar they are. 
<p>
<a name="line46">
If you've ever raised a child or started a business, you know what I'm talking about. 
<p>
<a name="line47">
You put your heart and soul into it. 
<p>
<a name="line48">
You work to find the 25th hour in the day 
<p>
<a name="line49">
You struggle to overcome insurmountable odds. 
<p>
<a name="line50">
And you do it all because you believe in an unlimited future. 
<p>
<a name="line51">
"An unlimited future." Isn't that what America is all about? 
<p>
<a name="line52">
But today, when I talk to the young families and the struggling businesses I meet throughout Delaware, I have to ask: are we creating an unlimited future for them? 
<p>
<a name="line53">
A Gallup report recently said nearly 50% of small businesses owners aren't hiring because of what they call "regulatory uncertainty." 
<p>
<a name="line54">
Can you blame them? 
<p>
<a name="line55">
This Administration has imposed 106 new major regulations. 
<p>
<a name="line56">
They are on track to create 109 million new paperwork burden hours. 
<p>
<a name="line57">
And by year's end, $110 billion dollars' worth of new regulatory costs will be laid on the backs of business owners and taxpayers. 
<p>
<a name="line58">
You might call that "regulatory uncertainty." 
<p>
<a name="line59">
I call it an all-out assault on free enterprise. 
<p>
<a name="line60">
That's what worries me about this Administration. They seem so eager to "fix" society. 
<p>
<a name="line61">
But they don't have a clue about how to fix the economy. In the end, it all comes down to what you believe. 
<p>
<a name="line62">
And yes, they are believers! 
<p>
<a name="line63">
The Obama Administration believes in "experts" and blue ribbon panels. 
<p>
<a name="line64">
They believe in creating new agencies and boards. 
<p>
<a name="line65">
They believe in all that ­ but they just don't trust the entrepreneur's ability to grow her own business and to create jobs. 
<p>
<a name="line66">
Mitt Romney not only believes in the values of economic freedom. His entire life has been committed to advancing it. 
<p>
<a name="line67">
Last April, I was privileged to be one of a dozen business leaders in Delaware to sit down and meet with Mitt Romney. 
<p>
<a name="line68">
This wasn't some scripted photo op; this wasn't a staged event; this was a real discussion with someone who understands where small business is coming from. 
<p>
<a name="line69">
You see, for Governor Romney, free enterprise isn't just a theory you study in graduate school. It's a creed. A commitment. A world view. 
<p>
<a name="line70">
It's what connects Americans, families, and communities, to an unlimited future. 
<p>
<a name="line71">
That's why this election is so important to our small businesses and to our country. 
<p>
<a name="line72">
I represent the small businesses, the women, and the families working so hard to rebuild our communities. 
<p>
<a name="line73">
In order to secure our unlimited future, we need a leader who understands the moral case for free enterprise. 
<p>
<a name="line74">
Someone who believes in an unlimited future. 
<p>
<a name="line75">
These aren't just words to Mitt Romney. His track record proves it. 
<p>
<a name="line76">
Let's secure that future together by sending Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to the White House in November! 
<p>
<a name="line77">
Dios lo Bendiga! God Bless America! 
<p>
<a name="line78">
