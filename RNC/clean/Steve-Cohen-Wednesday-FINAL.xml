<title>The opportunity to create new products and open new markets is the American Dream. This capitalistic spirit has supported our economy since its founding. </title>

<title>It can take several years and tens of thousands of dollars to achieve patent status. Once granted, we expect it to be protected. Our products are often stolen and copied overseas for a mere fraction of the price. </title>

These factors create a tremendous disadvantage in the global market place. </title>
