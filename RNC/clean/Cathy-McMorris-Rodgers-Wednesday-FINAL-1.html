Good evening. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
While we gather here tonight for the second night of the GOP Convention in Tampa, we'd like to pause to acknowledge those along the Gulf Coast impacted by Hurricane Isaac. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
While it's now been downgraded to a tropical storm, our hearts and our prayers remain with them. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
And we pledge to help them recover and rebuild. 
<p>
<a name="line5">

<a name="line6">
Tonight we have a terrific line-up for you. Our theme tonight is, "We can change it." 
<p>
<a name="line7">
We have heard of the challenges America is facing; now let's talk about the solutions. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
Those of you here in the convention, and those of you watching at home, know what needs to be done: 
<p>
<a name="line9">
--We need to create more jobs and get our economy moving again. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
--We need to make college affordable and within the reach of every child. I was the first in my family to graduate from college, so I know how important that is to the American Dream. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
--We need a government that works for us, not against us, and lives within its means (just like you and I do). 
<p>
<a name="line12">
--We also need a president who shares these ideas and values. Our current president has a different philosophy. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
For every problem, he has the same solution: more taxes, more spending and more government. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
We know how those policies have turned out: more unemployment, more poverty, and more debt. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
Friends, we know we can do better ­ we can change it. And tonight's program is filled with people who will tell us how. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
Senator John Thune will talk to us about how small businesses ­ like the one I ran with my family in Washington state ­ are the fuel our economy needs. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
Senator Rob Portman will talk to us about the vital role of international trade in jump-starting our economy. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
Governor Tim Pawlenty will share with us why he believes Mitt Romney is the man who can get the job done. 
<p>
<a name="line19">
We're so pleased that Mike Huckabee will be with us. We look forward to hearing his candid assessments as one of America's favorite former governors. 
<p>
<a name="line20">
And former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will talk about America's role on the world stage ­ and how our current economic situation impacts our ability to lead. 
<p>
<a name="line21">
New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez will talk about how she became the first female Hispanic governor in American history ­ and how she hopes to break down barriers for other young women. 
<p>
<a name="line22">
And finally, our keynote speaker is a man with the courage of his convictions, who is not afraid to tackle the tough questions facing our country, the next vice president of the United States, Paul Ryan. 
<p>
<a name="line23">
So let's start by talking about one of the first things that will change under Mitt Romney ­ Obamacare. Join me in welcoming Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens. 
<p>
<a name="line24">
