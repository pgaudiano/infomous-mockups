<a name="line1">
The past four years of "Hope and "Change" have led me to one simple conclusion: 
<p>
<a name="line2">
Our only "Hope" is to "Change" the current resident of the White House. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
And I am so proud to support the next President of the United States, Governor Mitt Romney! 
<p>
<a name="line4">
You see, as a poor kid growing up in a single parent household in North Charleston, South Carolina, I felt like I didn't have much going for me. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
But I did have a couple of things. A mom who believed in tough love. And that love comes at the end of a switch. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
And my momma loved me a lot! 
<p>
<a name="line7">
And a small business owner who was my mentor. And taught me that I could "think my way out of poverty." He taught me that having a job is a good thing but creating jobs was even better. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
Mitt Romney embodies the same vision for America that my mentor had for me. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
He believes that the path forward is more important than the place where we begin. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
And let me close by giving President Obama a heartfelt message from the good people of South Carolina: 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Hit the road, Jack! And don't you come back no more, no more, no more! 
<p>
<a name="line12">
Thank you.                                               ### </body>
