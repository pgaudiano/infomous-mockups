<a name="line1">
I'm Richard Hudson, running for Congress in North Carolina. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
In NC we tell the truth. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
The truth is you can't support open-ended bailouts and giveaways if you want to create jobs. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
You can't support Obamacare and say you're saving Medicare. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
And you cannot support Barack Obama if you want to stop the spending, stop the waste and stop the assault on our values. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
This election is about real people ­ people who are suffering under the policies of President Obama and his friends like Larry Kissell. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
It's about the woman in Thomasville who told me she has to support two men at home ­ her husband who was laid off and her recent college graduate son who can't find a job. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
And it's about the home builder in Monroe who will take any kind of work just to avoid laying off any more employees. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
The people of NC are suffering under President Obama. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
It's not just time for a change ­ it's time for the great American comeback! 
<p>
<a name="line11">
I give you my word, I will fight every day for what's right. Because it's not about politics, it's about people. It's about our future. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are right for America. Obama and Biden are just wrong! Thank you. God bless you. God bless America. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
