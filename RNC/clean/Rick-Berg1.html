Thank you, Mr. Chairman and delegates, 
<p>
<a name="line2">
It is a privilege to share with you North Dakota's success story and to voice my support for our next President, Mitt Romney. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
President Obama has put America on the wrong track, but my home state, North Dakota, shows a different way forward. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
We have less than 3% unemployment, rising salaries, and a budget surplus. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
Mr. President, if you're still looking for an example where the private sector is actually doing fine, you can look to North Dakota. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
That is because we don't burden our job creators with red tape. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
We understand ­ just like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan ­ that small businesses are the engines of our economy, so we get government out of their way and let entrepreneurs build their businesses. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
We trust the individual ­ not big government ­ to make decisions about their money, families, and opportunities. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
This is the North Dakota way. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
And it works. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Mitt Romney shares an understanding of the solutions North Dakota has developed and is prepared to lead where President Obama has left broken promises. With Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in the White House and a Republican majority in the Senate, our North Dakota way can be the American way. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
Thank you and God Bless. 
<p>
