<title>He was born to a farming family in rural Cuba. Childhood polio left him permanently disabled. Because he couldn't work the farm, his family sent him to school, and he became the only one in the family who could read. </title>

<title>As a boy, I would sit on our porch and listen to his stories about history, politics and baseball while he puffed on one of his three daily Padron cigars. </title>

<title>I don't recall everything we talked about, but the one thing I remember, is the one thing he wanted me to never forget. The dreams he had when he was young became impossible to achieve. </title>

<title>For those of us who were born and raised in this country, it's easy to forget how special America is. But my grandfather understood how different America is from the rest of the world, because he knew what life was like outside America. </title>

<title>Mitt Romney knows America's prosperity didn't happen because our government simply spent more. It happened because our people used their own money to open a business. And when they succeed, they hire more people, who then invest or spend their money in the economy, helping others start a business and create jobs. </title>

<title>Our problem with President Obama isn't that he's a bad person. By all accounts, he too is a good husband, and a good father -- and thanks to lots of practice, a pretty good golfer. </title>

<title>These are tired and old big government ideas. Ideas that people come to America to get away from. Ideas that threaten to make America more like the rest of the world, instead of helping the world become more like America. </title>

<title>Now millions of Americans are insecure about their future. But instead of inspiring us by reminding us of what makes us special, he divides us against each other. </title>

<title>No matter how you feel about President Obama, this election is about your future, not his. And it's not simply a choice between a Democrat and a Republican. </title>

<item>
<title>It's a choice about what kind of country we want America to be. </title>

	<author>The Hon. Marco Rubio</author>
</item>


<item>
<title>As we prepare to make this choice, we should remember what made us special. For most of history almost everyone was poor. Power and wealth belonged to only a few. </title>

<item>
<title>Your rights were whatever your rulers allowed you to have. Your future was determined by your past. If your parents were poor, so would you be. If you were born without opportunities, so were your children. </title>
	<link>http://www.infomous.com/site/mockups/RNC/clean/MarcoRubio-Thursday.html#line28</link>
	<author>The Hon. Marco Rubio</author>
</item>


<item>
<title>But America was founded on the principle that every person has God-given rights. That power belongs to the people. That government exists to protect our rights and serve our interests. That we shouldn't be trapped in the circumstances of our birth. That we should be free to go as far as our talents and work can take us. </title>

	<author>The Hon. Marco Rubio</author>
</item>


<item>
<title>We are special because we've been united not by a common race or ethnicity. We're bound together by common values. That family is the most important institution in society. That almighty God is the source of all we have. </title>
	<link>http://www.infomous.com/site/mockups/RNC/clean/MarcoRubio-Thursday.html#line30</link>
	<author>The Hon. Marco Rubio</author>
</item>


<item>
<title>Special, because we've never made the mistake of believing that we are so smart that we can rely solely on our leaders or our government. </title>

<title>Our national motto is "In God we Trust," reminding us that faith in our Creator is the most important American value of all. </title>

	<author>The Hon. Marco Rubio</author>

<item>
<title>And special because we've always understood the scriptural admonition that "for everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required." </title>

<title>Maybe, after years of hard work, this was the time you expected to be your prime earning years. But instead, you've been laid off, and your house is worth less than your mortgage. </title>

<title>Maybe you did everything you were told you needed to do to get ahead. You studied hard and finished school. But now, you owe thousands of dollars in student loans. You can't find a job in your field. And you've moved back in with your parents. </title>

<item>
<title>And Mitt Romney is running for president because he knows that if we are willing to do for our children what our parents did for us, life in America can be better than it has ever been. My mother was one of seven girls whose parents went to bed hungry so their children wouldn't. My father lost his mother when he was nine. He left school and went to work for the next 70 years. </title>

<title>My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier, a maid and a stock clerk at K-Mart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful. Because just a few decades removed from hopelessness, they made possible for us all the things that had been impossible for them. </title>

<title>A few years ago during a speech, I noticed a bartender behind a portable bar at the back of the ballroom. I remembered my father who had worked for many years as a banquet bartender. </title>
