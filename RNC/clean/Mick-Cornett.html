<h2>Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett<br>(Remarks as Prepared for Delivery)

</h2>

<a name="line1">
I'm pleased to be here representing my fellow Republican mayors. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
In Oklahoma, we think we've made a very real and substantial contribution to this presidential ticket. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
Janna Ryan, the smart and charming wife of the next Vice President of the United States, is from Oklahoma, and Paul and Janna were married in Oklahoma City. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
It's becoming more and more unusual for our best and brightest to leave the state, but in this case we're glad it's worked out the way it has. We're enjoying a renaissance in Oklahoma City. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
It's a renaissance fueled by sound, fiscally conservative leadership and a belief that local investment in infrastructure is vital to economic development. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
Twenty years ago we decided "we can do better" and we have. Today, we have the nation's lowest unemployment rate among large U.S. metropolitan areas. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
While there is a role for Washington in addressing our city's critical infrastructure needs ­ we chose to invest in ourselves. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
We built quality-of-life amenities that have transformed our city into a dynamic home for smart young people and enterprising businesses. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
Oklahoma City was recently named as the most entrepreneurial city in the country, with the most start-ups per capita. Interestingly, we have NOT done this by creating large amounts of debt. We did something unique for many of our infrastructure packages: we paid cash. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
Today we are building a community that is more walkable, more sustainable, more affordable and more business-friendly, and we are building it with the kind of common-sense economic policies that we need in Washington, policies that Mitt Romney will deliver as the next president of the United States. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
      Thank you.                                                 ### </body>
