<title>That's the motto of the great state of New Hampshire. But I believe tonight we all share that view ­ as have generations of Americans before us. </title>

<title>When he returned home from the war ­ he found himself in the same position as so many Americans ­ he needed a job. </title>

<title>And when I say he ­ I mean we ­ because I spent many a sleepless night shoveling snow. And I'm proud of the fact that in addition to being a United States Senator ­ I'm also pretty good with a snow plow! </title>

<title>We borrowed money to pursue our dreams. And believe me, there was no guarantee of success. We certainly were not too big to fail ­ we had to make it work. </title>

<item>
<title>Yet through all the hard work and sacrifice ­ we pulled together as a family. As the business grew so did our extended family. </title>

<item>
<title>My concern is that President Obama is making it very difficult for small businesses to get started ­ to create jobs ­ and to survive. </title>
	<link>http://www.infomous.com/site/mockups/RNC/clean/Kelly-Ayotte.html#line12</link>
	<author>The Hon. Kelly Ayotte</author>

<item>
<title>I hear this all the time from the small business owners I speak with. They want to focus on their business. The Obama Administration wants to bury them with rules, regulations and red tape. </title>

<item>
<title>Under this Administration, the regulations are up ­ and the job creation is down. </title>

<item>
<title>President Obama's view is clear: he actually believes that as a family business grows ­ the federal government should take a larger share of its earnings. </title>

<title>That's punishment for expanding and creating more jobs. </title>

<title>I call it a "success tax." </title>

<title>And the very best example is Obamacare. </title>

<title>Let me tell you what I hear in the real world about Obamacare. </title>

<title>Just a couple of months ago ­ a successful restaurant owner in Concord, New Hampshire, told me about his dilemma. He wanted to open up a second restaurant ­ and hire more employees. </title>

<item>
<title>But he realized that if he did ­ he would trigger penalties under Obamacare and he couldn't afford it. So he never opened up that restaurant. </title>

<item>
<title>Is that what we want for small businesses in America ­ to be afraid to grow because of the government? To face penalties when you create more jobs? </title>
	<link>http://www.infomous.com/site/mockups/RNC/clean/Kelly-Ayotte.html#line23</link>

<title>To be told "you're earning too much"? </title>

	<author>The Hon. Kelly Ayotte</author>

<item>
<title>Isn't it time we had a leader who believes that creating jobs ought to be celebrated not penalized? </title>

<title>That is why Mitt Romney is running for president. </title>

<title>He'll get the federal government out of the business of small business. </title>

<title>He'll fight to lower and simplify taxes. </title>

<title>He'll work to eliminate job-killing red tape. </title>

<title>And he will roll back Obamacare starting on Day One! </title>

<item>
<title>In both the private sector and as Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney always asked: how can I help small businesses grow, innovate, and compete? </title>
	<link>http://www.infomous.com/site/mockups/RNC/clean/Kelly-Ayotte.html#line31</link>

<item>
<title>It's the right question. And it's the question that this Administration never thinks to ask. </title>
	<link>http://www.infomous.com/site/mockups/RNC/clean/Kelly-Ayotte.html#line32</link>
	<author>The Hon. Kelly Ayotte</author>

<item>
<title>But why should we be surprised? President Obama has never even run a lemonade stand ­ and it shows. </title>

<item>
<title>So what we need to do is clear. For the sake of the future of small business ­ we need to replace Barack Obama. </title>
