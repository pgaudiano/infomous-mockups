<title>Before I ran for office I worked in my family's business, the Peach Crest Fruit Basket, for 13 years. I worked hard every day, and I can assure you that my family built that business from the ground up. </title>

<title>You'll hear from Jack Gilchrist, the owner of a family-owned metal fabricating business in New Hampshire. A number of our nation's leading governors are with us tonight. The chief executives from states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Nevada and Virginia ­ places where they have created an environment that unleashes American ingenuity instead of stifling it. </title>

<title>They will tell us how the job creators in their communities aren't found in the state house ­ they're found on Main Street. </title>
