Throughout his life, friends, family, businesses, charities, troubled entities, and a Commonwealth have turned to a leader ­ Mitt Romney ­ when they needed wisdom, support or a turnaround. Each time he answered the call and led. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
Mitt Romney, with humility, grace and diligence, has succeeded at everything he has done: as a successful governor, with a cabinet that was 50% women, at turning around the scandal-plagued Olympics, as a businessman, and as a husband, father and grandfather. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
He is a man uniquely prepared and committed to lead America at this critical point when we can do so much better with the right leadership. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
I am so pleased that this week, the American people are again meeting this man ­ this leader that so many of us who have been privileged to know and work with ­ admire and love. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
I am deeply honored, proud and excited to second the nomination of Mitt Romney for the office of President of the United States!
