<title>And, while there are far too many people involved in this endeavor to thank everyone individually, I'd like to thank the 106 members of our staff, the thousands of volunteers, and acknowledge our chief operating officer, Mike Miller, who has been the foundation of our efforts. </title>

<title>I believe the convention is an important institution, not just for our candidates or for our Party, but for our democracy. Right now, our men and women in uniform around the world stand in defense of our freedoms. Our right to select a leader of our choosing is one of the most important freedoms they work to uphold. </title>

<title>This convention will enable Governor Romney and Representative Ryan to communicate their message and vision for the country with the American people. </title>
