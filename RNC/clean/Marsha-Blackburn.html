<a name="line1">
Co-chairing your platform committee has been a great honor. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
It's also been a lot of work ­ and a lot of fun. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
You can be so proud of the members of your state delegations. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
They were smart, conscientious, and opinionated in the best way. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
They knew what they and you believed, and weren't afraid to say so. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
And neither were the thousands of American people who responded to our call and through social media offered us their solutions to the challenges that face our country. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
It has been a remarkable exercise in grassroots democracy and, from this day forward, the GOP will be known as the Great Opportunity Party. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
If you want to know how our economy can create the millions of jobs we need in order to get America back to work; 
<p>
<a name="line9">
If you want to know how we're going to get the unlimited energy we need to power our economy so that this really will be an American century; 
<p>
<a name="line10">
If you're alarmed by our country's declining position in the world, and wondering what can be done to reverse it; 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Read this platform. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
Read it to learn how, together, we can assure a quality education for every child, regardless of where they live or what their family income might be. Read it to discover how the American people can replace Obamacare with patient-centered, quality healthcare. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
Read it to learn about the Republican Party's commitment to true federalism -- where the states take the lead in providing smaller, smarter and more efficient government. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
If you want to know how Republicans ­ Republicans like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan ­ are going to get America back on track, and back into the black, go online and read this platform. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
And you will find that where we stand is right with you, with every American who wants a better future for their children, a more secure future for the elderly and a renewed promise of the American dream. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
Thank you. 
<p>
