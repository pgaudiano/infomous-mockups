<title>I have had the good fortune--the amazing blessing--to represent this great country, as a proud member of Team USA at the last five Olympic Games, in doubles trap and skeet shooting competitions. </title>

<title>I won my first gold medal in Atlanta, in the summer of 1996, and I just returned from the Olympics in London, a few weeks ago with another gold medal. This was one of a record-setting 104 medals won by Team USA, including 58 by women--which is the most ever. I think it's safe to say we showed the world that American women are a force to be reckoned with! </title>

<title>From the time when I walked into the Games in Atlanta as a wide-eyed 16-year-old to the moment a few weeks ago, when I heard our national anthem played in London as a seasoned veteran, I've seen our country both prosper and more recently falter. </title>

<title>Not unlike my athletic career, there were times when things were going very well, and times when they were not. It was in those times -- when things were difficult -- that I learned to rely on strong leadership to get me--as they say in my world -- back on target. </title>

<title>I came here tonight because I believe that today our country is off-target. We need the leadership of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to turn our country around so the millions of Americans who have taken aim at their own dreams -- whatever they may be -- have the opportunity for those dreams to come true just like our Olympic dreams did. </title>

<title>I am honored to have this opportunity tonight to talk with you about the global significance of the Olympic movement -- its ideals and its meaning ­ and how it was rescued by Mitt Romney. </title>

<title>It has been over 10 years, so many of you may have forgotten, but in 2002, due to bribery scandals and mismanagement, the Olympics -- not just those Games -- but the Olympics as an institution -- were threatened. </title>

<title>Thankfully, Mitt Romney was there, to salvage a desperate situation. </title>

<item>
<title>Mitt's leadership not only turned around those Games by solving the operational and financial problems ­ but he did something deeper ­ he drew a line in the sand and said, that the 2002 Games would have the highest standards of ethics and integrity. He put Olympians -- the athletes -- and the ideals of the Olympics back at the center of the Games. </title>

<title>I was fortunate to compete in the Olympics as the captain of the 1980 U.S. "Miracle on Ice" hockey team. And that team was proud and honored to light the cauldron for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. That action, of passing along the flame of the Olympic spirit symbolizes something grander than all of us. It is the single greatest movement that brings all humans -- across the world -- together. </title>

<title>But somehow, from inside a Roller Rink as a teenager, a dream grew within my heart that, someday maybe I could represent my country at the Olympic Games. </title>

<title>The Olympics were mired in scandal and budget deficit and, even worse, the national tragedy of September 11th that shook our entire nation to its very core. It was a time of uncertainty. But in my Olympic world, Mitt Romney was at the helm. </title>

<title>February 8th, 2002, was a cold, but clear night in Salt Lake City. It was the night of the Opening Ceremonies. </title>

<title>I was competing the very next morning so I was not planning to attend. That is, until I got a call from the U.S. Olympic Committee just hours before the ceremony asking me if I would be one of the eight athletes selected to carry the World Trade Center flag into the Opening Ceremonies. I was floored. </title>

<item>
<title>They began telling us how proud they were of us - that the families of the victims were proud of us - that all the people who'd lost their lives would be proud of us. When it came time to begin the procession, I touched the flag for the first time, and I remember a physical sensation unlike anything I had ever experienced. If it's possible to feel your soul being touched, then that is what I felt. </title>

<title>As we carried the flag out before the capacity crowd and a worldwide television audience, the silence was deafening. The flag, which had flown over so much pain and loss, still stood for life, love and the hope of our nation. </title>
