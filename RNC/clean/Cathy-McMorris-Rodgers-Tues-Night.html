<a name="line1">
Good evening ladies and gentleman. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
Thank you. My name is Cathy McMorris Rogers, and I am proud to represent eastern Washington in Congress. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
Tonight, we're going to do things a little differently. I have the pleasure of being your host for the night guiding you through the next few hours. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
I'm delighted to report that we have a wonderful lineup for you. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
Each speaker will be joining together to send a message to President Obama. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
And that message is three simple words: We built it. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Before I ran for office I worked in my family's business, the Peach Crest Fruit Basket, for 13 years. I worked hard every day, and I can assure you that my family built that business from the ground up. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
Today, that hands-on experience guides my decision-making in Congress. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
Unlike President Obama, I know that small businesses are the true engine of our economy ­ not the government ­ and what businesses need to grow and create jobs is less taxes and regulation, not more. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
Tonight you'll hear a variety of stories from people who work hard every day to build our economy. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
You'll hear from Jack Gilchrist, the owner of a family-owned metal fabricating business in New Hampshire. A number of our nation's leading governors are with us tonight. The chief executives from states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Nevada and Virginia ­ places where they have created an environment that unleashes American ingenuity instead of stifling it. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
They will tell us how the job creators in their communities aren't found in the state house ­ they're found on Main Street. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
And one of the speakers I'm most looking forward to hearing from tonight is someone who I think we all can agree will make a fabulous First Lady, Ann Romney. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
To close out the evening, we will hear from a dynamic and engaging leader who is shaking up the way they do business in New Jersey ­ Governor Chris Christie. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
So let's get started. Our next speaker is from the Granite State and was elected to the United States Senate in 2010. Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Kelly Ayotte. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
