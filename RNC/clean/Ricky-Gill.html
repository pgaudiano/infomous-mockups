<h2>Ricky Gill<br>Republican Candidate for Congress, Ninth District of California
<br>(Remarks as Prepared for Delivery)

</h2>
<h3>August 28, 2012</h3>
<a name="line1">
My name is Ricky Gill, and I am humbled to stand before you as a Republican nominee for Congress ­ and a proud son of California's San Joaquin Valley. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
My parents immigrated to the Valley from India and Africa with only their love for each other, a strong work ethic, and the enduring desire to pursue their American Dream. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
We all work hard in the Valley, and we're proud to live there. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
But today we face crippling unemployment and foreclosures ­ even the bankruptcy of Stockton, our largest city. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
Young people leave -- or drop out of school to help their families make ends meet. Our friends and neighbors are suffering. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
But the Valley is a cautionary tale of failed policies, not false ambitions. No one in this country dreams of dependency; no one hopes for mediocrity. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
We are ready again to seize the measure of our ambitions ­ not because the government says we can, but because we believe we can. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
We need a new generation of leadership to chart the path ­ to fight for policies that create jobs, rather than red tape ­ and to help small businesses succeed, rather than helping green energy companies fail. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
Like you, we Valley folks are tough, independent, and faithful ­ and we are ready to rebuild our American Dream. Thank you, and God Bless America. 
<p>
