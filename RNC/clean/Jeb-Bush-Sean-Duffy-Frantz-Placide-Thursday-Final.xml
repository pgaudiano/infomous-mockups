<title>This election is about the future of this nation. We can shape that future with what we do here, with what we do November 6. </title>

<title>That starts with a strong economy, a smart energy policy, lower deficits, and a president who puts America's workers and job-creators first. </title>

<title>As a candidate and Governor, I visited over 400 schools. I saw children read their first sentences. Solve their first long-division problems. Explore the miracles of chemistry and physics. </title>

<title>The sad truth is that equality of opportunity doesn't exist in many of our schools. We give some kids a chance, but not all. </title>

<title>For the last decade, this state has been on a path of reform. Under the leadership of Governor Rick Scott and local leaders, our focus every day is whether students are learning. That's it. </title>

<title>And perhaps most exciting, those traditionally left behind are showing the greatest gains. </title>

<title>And among Latino students, the gains were so big, they required a new metric. Right now, Florida's fourth grade Hispanic students read as well or better than the average of all students in 21 states and the District of Columbia. </title>

<title>And at the end of the day, all of what we do from the educators to the policy makers has to be student-focused and student-centered. </title>

<title>Education is hard work, but if you follow some core principles, and you challenge the status quo, you get great results. So here's another thing we can do: Let's give every parent in America a choice about where their child attends school. </title>

<title>I knew that could lead to an unproductive and failing future. Thanks to Governor Bush's school choice program, I got the chance to choose a better school. Making my education my priority, I enrolled at one of the toughest private schools in Miami - Archbishop Curley Notre Dame. </title>

<title>But I do know the numbers for failure, and I probably wouldn't have had a very good chance. Governor Bush's school choice program gave me the chance to achieve academic success, in the school that was the best fit for me. </title>
