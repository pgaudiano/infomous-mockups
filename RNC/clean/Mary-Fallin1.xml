<title>President Ronald Reagan once said "there are no great limits to growth, because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder." </title>

<title>We can ­ and we will ­ overcome any economic challenge if government lets go of the regulatory chokehold zapping the air out of the economy and deflating the spirits of our entrepreneurs. </title>

<title>We need a president who will applaud and encourage those who work hard to pursue their dreams, to reach their potential, and, in doing so, make themselves and America better and stronger. </title>

<title>The history of my state of Oklahoma offers a great example of pursuing the American Dream. It was built and settled by pioneers moving West to seek better lives. </title>

<title>And in 1897, eight years after the Land Run, a handful of adventurous pioneers risked their own money ­ not, the federal government's money ­ to drill Oklahoma's first oil well, the Nellie Johnstone. </title>

<title>By doing so, these early-day pioneers changed the future and the fortune of Oklahoma forever, and today Oklahoma is one of the nation's key energy producers and job creators. President Obama wants us to believe that Oklahomans owe that success to the federal government: to the Department of Energy, to the EPA, the IRS or maybe even to him. </title>
