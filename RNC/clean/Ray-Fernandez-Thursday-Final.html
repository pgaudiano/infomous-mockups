Thank you. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
These last few months, we've heard a lot of false information about Bain Capital and private equity. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
I'm proud to stand here ­ and tell you what I saw ­ when Bain Capital bought the company where I worked. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
The experience improved my job and it gave me opportunities that I always believed were part of the American dream. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
In 1996, I became a sales rep at a contact lens business called Wesley Jessen. My sales region was right here in Florida, where my parents emigrated from Cuba when I was 13, a country, where the government owns everything but nothing works. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
Wesley Jessen had been struggling ­ losing over $50 million a year ­ under the previous owner. Then, Mitt Romney and Bain Capital came in. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Bain Capital saw something others didn't see. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
They invested money in marketing. They brought in a charismatic and dynamic CEO, Kevin Ryan. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
They did everything to make the company succeed. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
This is the real Bain Capital, the story the Obama campaign doesn't want you to hear. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Because of Bain Capital's attention and management, Wesley Jessen roared back. Workers like me, were inspired by what we saw ­ and our careers thrived. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
And when the company went public a few years later, I was well rewarded. With that money, my wife Sylvia, who is a pharmacist, and I started our own business in Hialeah, Florida ­ Vida Pharmacy. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
None of this would have been possible without Bain Capital's investment. They brought a vision and commitment to a struggling company. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
As a result, we are doing what we love, serving our community. We are building our future. 
<p>
<a name="line15">
Stories like this need to be told. My life today is better because of Bain Capital. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
Mitt Romney helped turn around my company. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
I can't imagine anyone better prepared to turn around this country. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
Thank you.
