<title>In 1775 our Founding Fathers rose up to establish our liberty. Today, we need to defeat a President whose actions threaten our liberty! </title>

<title>In this way, we are in a similar position as our Founding Fathers. Just as they were called upon, we are being called upon. What they started, what they believed in, we must defend! </title>

<title>We have a Democrat Senate leader who refuses to meet his moral obligation to pass a budget for the government. </title>

<title>We have a Democrat House leader that wouldn't allow a major piece of legislation--Obama Care--to be read before it was passed. She stated to the world, and I quote "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it." </title>

<title>We have a President that has bypassed the Senate confirmation process in order to appoint unaccountable czars to make and enforce policies on America's citizens. </title>

<title>A President that by executive action has changed immigration laws, imposed unconstitutional burdens on our states, and issued over-reaching regulations. We know the problem, America--their names are Obama ­ Biden ­ Reid ­ Pelosi ­ Holder. What they have done--and will continue to do, should Obama be re-elected--runs contrary to the values we believe in and the principles we stand for. </title>
