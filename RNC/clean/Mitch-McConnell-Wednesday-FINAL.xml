<title>America is about to turn the page on Barack Obama's four-year experiment in big government. </title>

<title>Over the past four years Americans have been led to believe we're just like everybody else, that America isn't unique. </title>

<title>The President scoffs at this idea. To him, this kind of thinking is the problem, not the solution. That's why he's spent the last four years lowering Americans' expectations instead of raising them. </title>

<title>What this administration has in mind for America isn't a renewal, it's a great leveling out. It wants the kind of government-imposed equality that in a single generation transformed Western Europe from a place where for centuries high achievement and discovery and innovation were celebrated and prized, to a place where they have elections about whether people should have to work. </title>

<title>As we meet here tonight, America is suffering through an economic calamity of truly historic dimensions. Some are calling it the slowest recovery in our nation's entire 236-year history. </title>
