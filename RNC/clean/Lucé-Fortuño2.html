<a name="line1">
Good evening Tampa! My name is Lucé, and it's great to be here with you tonight! 
<p>
<a name="line2">
I am the proud mother of 20-year-old triplets, a practicing attorney, a proud Latina, and a die-hard Republican! 
<p>
<a name="line3">
I am also the wife of someone we're extremely proud of back home in Puerto Rico: Luis Fortuño. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
As Governor, he has unleashed a true Republican revolution that has already accomplished so much. It is a success story of fiscal responsibility, controlled government spending, lower taxes, and pro-growth policies. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
But it is also one of caring and compassionate attention to a social and faith-based agenda of unprecedented reach and consequence. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
Through it all, I have stood by his side and learned what it takes to be the rock of support to a great leader, just like our next speaker has done for 43 years for our next President, Mitt Romney! 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Ann's story is one of remarkable courage, tenacity, and commitment: a story that stands in its own right, one that inspires all who know her. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
A woman of faith, a devoted wife, a caring mother to five boys, a multiple sclerosis and cancer survivor, a tireless advocate, and a timeless First Lady of Massachusetts. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
For decades, she's been a fighter who has championed the cause of disadvantaged children, been an advocate of teenage pregnancy prevention, a leader of faith and community-based initiatives, and an ambassador for multiple sclerosis awareness. Watching her, during a recent visit to Puerto Rico, I marveled at her ability to endear children, connect with the elderly, and engage workers at a farmers market with such ease, heart, and purpose that people wondered "who was the handsome gentleman next to her?" 
<p>
<a name="line10">
No wonder, she's been Mitt Romney's secret weapon for 43 years! 
<p>
<a name="line11">
No wonder Mitt calls her his personal hero! 
<p>
<a name="line12">
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you my friend and the next First Lady of the United States, Ann Romney! 
<p>
