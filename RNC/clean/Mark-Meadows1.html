You are here and I am here because we indeed do believe in America! We are at a crossroads; we have a choice to make. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
We have a President who wants his party to make us all dependent on government. We need leaders who believe in the prosperity that the free market brings. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
We have a President who tramples our first amendment right to religious liberty by requiring all taxpayers to fund abortions. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
We need public servants who respect life and our religious freedom. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
We have a President all-too-willing to lead from behind. We need a White House that will unflinchingly support our strongest ally, Israel. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
We need a President who believes in America. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
We have a nation too precious to give up on. We have a history too glorious to be forgotten. We have a Constitution too noble to be rewritten. We have a God who reigns over the affairs of nations. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
And we have a people who, once again, are ready to stand up as "We the People" and choose for themselves the direction of their beloved country. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
I'm Mark Meadows and I'm running for Congress. With Mitt Romney, we're ready to take our country back.                                         ### </body>
