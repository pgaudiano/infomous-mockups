Jeanine McDonnell: 
<p>
<a name="line2">
Good evening, I am proud to be one of the 212,000 servicewomen who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
As a 24 year old Virginian in Iraq, I worked with some of the most courageous men and women this nation has to offer, and we were united in a singular cause: to protect the nation that we love. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
It has been my privilege to serve alongside heroes of every service. Defending this nation and its citizens is not without sacrifice for service members and the families who support them. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
And that's why we need leaders who don't play chicken with our nation's defense. We need leaders who will invest in defense--not abandon it. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
And that's why we need Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Now, it is my honor to introduce Chris Devlin-Young, a hero in his own right, a former Coast Guardsman and a two-time Paralympic gold medalist in alpine skiing. Chris. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
Chris Devlin-Young: 
<p>
<a name="line9">
Thank you. It's wonderful to be with you tonight. In 1982, while flying in heavy fog during a Coast Guard mission, our plane crashed, leaving me paralyzed from the waist down. While my career as a Coast Guardsman ended, a new world of service began for me. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
27 years ago, this California boy was introduced to ski racing at the first Veterans Administration Winter Sports clinic. I decided then and there to dedicate myself to racing and coaching other injured veterans. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
Being a gold medal Paralympian gives me a whole new way to honor and serve my country. Being the coach of paralympic medalists gives me a way to honor and serve others. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
I believe that we can all serve no matter what our challenges. Because it's not about what you've lost in life but rather what you are able to give. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
And now, it is my honor to introduce a hero who has given of himself regardless of the price. He is the son and grandson of admirals, a decorated naval pilot, a war hero, and the senior senator from the great state of Arizona -- Senator John McCain. 
<p>
