	<description>The Hon. Kerry Healey

(Remarks as Prepared for Delivery)
</description>

	<title>Ten years ago, as chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party, I flew to Salt Lake City -- not to see the Olympics, but to meet the man who had saved them. </title>

<title>I had a message from the grassroots: "Come back to Massachusetts. Our state needs you!" </title>

<title>Mitt Romney had turned around companies and he had turned around the Olympics. Now Massachusetts needed Mitt Romney to turn us around. </title>

<title>Massachusetts was in deep trouble. We had a massive budget gap and soaring unemployment. </title>

<title>People in my state were losing hope -- for themselves, their families and their children. Sadly, very much like our country finds itself today. </title>

<title>Mitt Romney answered the call of service and accepted the challenge. </title>

<title>Well, he quickly assembled a cabinet of the best and the brightest, drawing on both parties, Republicans and Democrats, half women, half men, to give him the full spectrum of ideas and advice. </title>

<title>He respected different opinions, valued open debate, and when it was all said and done, Mitt Romney knew how to make a decision. </title>

<title>Governor Romney did what many thought was impossible. He turned around a $3 billion budget gap and created a $2 billion rainy day fund. Even as he worked to streamline government, he made certain to safeguard protections for the elderly, children and the homeless. </title>

<title>In education, Governor Romney gave parents more choices, insisted on tough standards for both teachers and students, and Massachusetts schools became the best in the nation. </title>

<title>We cleared out regulations on small businesses. We cut taxes 19 times. And, as a result, unemployment dropped to only 4.7 percent. </title>

<title>And, unlike President Obama, Governor Romney's economic policies were rewarded with a credit upgrade. </title>

<title>Those are the facts and figures, but when people find out that I served as Mitt Romney's lieutenant governor, they always ask me the same question: What's he like? </title>

<title>First and foremost, Mitt is a good and honorable man, committed to public service and his country. </title>

<title>On the morning he took the oath of office, his first act was to focus public attention on those in need. We served breakfast to homeless veterans -- encouraging volunteerism, and acknowledging the special debt we owe to those who sacrifice for our country. </title>

<title>Mitt never took a salary as governor. But he worked harder than anyone I know. </title>

<title>Early every morning, before the rest of us arrived, Mitt would meet with his economic secretary. They worked tirelessly -- because for Mitt, creating jobs was his top priority. </title>

<title>Mitt was always a hands-on leader. When one of Boston's tunnels collapsed, tragically killing a passenger in her car, Mitt didn't blame others. He dove in and fixed the problem. </title>

<title>Mitt immersed himself in the engineering challenges, personally oversaw safety inspections, abolished cronyism and corruption, and restored public confidence. </title>

<title>And he is ready to bring that same work ethic, vision and integrity to the White House. </title>

<item>
<title>He will never let our children's education be second-best or allow their future prosperity to be mortgaged by today's political cowardice. And he will respect those who build things with their own minds and their own hands. </title>

<item>
<title>And I'll tell you another thing, Mitt Romney understands that the world is a safer place when our country leads, and he will never apologize for America. </title>

<title>He will lead us back to an America we can be proud of -- and ahead to a future where the American dream is alive again, and within every man and woman's reach. </title>
