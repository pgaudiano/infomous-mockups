A friend who founded Staples with Mitt Romney once said to me, "The great thing about Mitt Romney is that he makes everyone who is around him greater than they were!" 
<p>
<a name="line2">
One of the folks that Mitt Romney brought in to help save the Salt Lake Olympics told me, "Every day on the way to work, you would say to yourself ­ that you owed it to Mitt to be better today than you were yesterday!" 
<p>
<a name="line3">
If ever there was a time that Americans need to be inspired to be better today than yesterday, that time is now. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
If ever there was a time that we needed someone to inspire us to do great things, that time is now! 
<p>
<a name="line5">
Today we come together as a party to nominate for president a man who will energize and inspire this country. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
The time has come for a new day in America. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
One with more freedom, one filled with more opportunities and jobs, and a lot less debt. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
That time and that man have met! 
<p>
<a name="line9">
That moment is now. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
That man is Mitt Romney! I have the incredible honor of seconding the nomination for Mitt Romney as the next President of the United States!
