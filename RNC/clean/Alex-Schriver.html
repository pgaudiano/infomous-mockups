As the elected leader of 250,000 College Republicans on more than 1,800 campuses, I've got one of the best jobs in the country. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
I get to push back against the bastions of liberalism ­ America's colleges and universities. 
<p>
<a name="line3">
Every day, I'm thankful to be employed. Yet, unfortunately, many of my peers are not as lucky. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
Half of my generation didn't get up and go to a job this morning. Many of them, in fact 3 out of 10, graduated this year and moved back in with their parents. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
The fact is: we're young. We're focused. We're driven. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
And we need to be out making our mark on the world. Instead, our generation is having a mark made on us. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
Our country is nearly $16 trillion in debt ­ a burden placed on our generation's back. We're tired of it. 
<p>
<a name="line8">
And we're tired of a President and his cronies in Congress being all-too-willing to kick the nation's fiscal crisis down to our road. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
Governor Mitt Romney has a plan to get America back to work, to rein in our out-of-control spending, and to get our great country back on a sustainable path. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
That plan is just what we need. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
At the end of the day, Barack Obama has failed young Americans. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
We're out of jobs, we're out of "hope" and we're out of "change." 
<p>
<a name="line13">
Our generation can do better. My generation deserves better. Thank you very much, God bless you! 
<p>
