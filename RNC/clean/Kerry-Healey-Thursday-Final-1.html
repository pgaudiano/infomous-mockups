<br>(Remarks as Prepared for Delivery)

<a name="line1">
Ten years ago, as chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party, I flew to Salt Lake City -- not to see the Olympics, but to meet the man who had saved them. 
<p>
<a name="line2">
I had a message from the grassroots: "Come back to Massachusetts. Our state needs you!" 
<p>
<a name="line3">
Mitt Romney had turned around companies and he had turned around the Olympics. Now Massachusetts needed Mitt Romney to turn us around. 
<p>
<a name="line4">
Massachusetts was in deep trouble. We had a massive budget gap and soaring unemployment. 
<p>
<a name="line5">
People in my state were losing hope -- for themselves, their families and their children. Sadly, very much like our country finds itself today. 
<p>
<a name="line6">
Mitt Romney answered the call of service and accepted the challenge. 
<p>
<a name="line7">
How did he fix our state? 
<p>
<a name="line8">
Well, he quickly assembled a cabinet of the best and the brightest, drawing on both parties, Republicans and Democrats, half women, half men, to give him the full spectrum of ideas and advice. 
<p>
<a name="line9">
He respected different opinions, valued open debate, and when it was all said and done, Mitt Romney knew how to make a decision. 
<p>
<a name="line10">
Governor Romney did what many thought was impossible. He turned around a $3 billion budget gap and created a $2 billion rainy day fund. Even as he worked to streamline government, he made certain to safeguard protections for the elderly, children and the homeless. 
<p>
<a name="line11">
In education, Governor Romney gave parents more choices, insisted on tough standards for both teachers and students, and Massachusetts schools became the best in the nation. 
<p>
<a name="line12">
We cleared out regulations on small businesses. We cut taxes 19 times. And, as a result, unemployment dropped to only 4.7 percent. 
<p>
<a name="line13">
And, unlike President Obama, Governor Romney's economic policies were rewarded with a credit upgrade. 
<p>
<a name="line14">
Those are the facts and figures, but when people find out that I served as Mitt Romney's lieutenant governor, they always ask me the same question: What's he like? 
<p>
<a name="line15">
First and foremost, Mitt is a good and honorable man, committed to public service and his country. 
<p>
<a name="line16">
On the morning he took the oath of office, his first act was to focus public attention on those in need. We served breakfast to homeless veterans -- encouraging volunteerism, and acknowledging the special debt we owe to those who sacrifice for our country. 
<p>
<a name="line17">
Mitt never took a salary as governor. But he worked harder than anyone I know. 
<p>
<a name="line18">
Early every morning, before the rest of us arrived, Mitt would meet with his economic secretary. They worked tirelessly -- because for Mitt, creating jobs was his top priority. 
<p>
<a name="line19">
Mitt was always a hands-on leader. When one of Boston's tunnels collapsed, tragically killing a passenger in her car, Mitt didn't blame others. He dove in and fixed the problem. 
<p>
<a name="line20">
Mitt immersed himself in the engineering challenges, personally oversaw safety inspections, abolished cronyism and corruption, and restored public confidence. 
<p>
<a name="line21">
That's the Mitt Romney I know. 
<p>
<a name="line22">
And he is ready to bring that same work ethic, vision and integrity to the White House. 
<p>
<a name="line23">
He will never let our children's education be second-best or allow their future prosperity to be mortgaged by today's political cowardice. And he will respect those who build things with their own minds and their own hands. 
<p>
<a name="line24">
Mitt Romney won't just talk about family values, he will live them. 
<p>
<a name="line25">
And I'll tell you another thing, Mitt Romney understands that the world is a safer place when our country leads, and he will never apologize for America. 
<p>
<a name="line26">
He will lead us back to an America we can be proud of -- and ahead to a future where the American dream is alive again, and within every man and woman's reach. 
<p>
<a name="line27">
Thank you, Mitt Romney, for believing in America. 
<p>
<a name="line28">
And America, you can believe in Mitt Romney! 
<p>
