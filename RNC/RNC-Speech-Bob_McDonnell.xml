The choice is clear: the status quo of the entitlement society, or dynamic change to an opportunity society. We need a President who will say to a small businesswoman: congratulations, we applaud your success, you did make that happen, you did build that! Big government didn't build America: You built America! Small businesses don't come out of Washington D.C. pre-made on flat bed trucks. That coffee shop in Henrico; that florist in Virginia Beach....that bakery in Radford...they were all built by entrepreneurial Americans with big dreams....not a big spending government with a wide open wallet full of other people's money!" ... "Conservative fiscal policies are working, and so are more Americans in states with Republican governors. Now, just think what we can do if we had a President who would support us, not obstruct us. Someone who has created jobs in the private sector, who understands the economy, and who has actually balanced a budget....or heck, for that matter, who has actually passed a budget!</title></item><item><title>We need President Mitt Romney! When Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan get to work with Susana Martinez...Scott Walker...John Kasich ....Terry Branstad and governors from both parties across this country, we will get people back to work!"</title></item><item><title></title></item></channel></rss>
