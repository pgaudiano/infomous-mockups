August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Jackie Walorski Republican Candidate for Congress, Second District of Indiana (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 Good afternoon. I'm proud to represent Indiana, which we affectionately refer to as the Hoosier State. Hoosiers cherish values like common sense, hard work and problem solving. And there's a lot Washington can learn from the Hoosier state. When Indiana faced a massive budget shortfall, we didn't play partisan games. We came together, rolled up our sleeves and turned a billion-dollar deficit into a surplus. We understood that when you have a deficit, spending more money isn't the solution. In the face of record unemployment, we understood that more government spending won't create jobs. That's why we passed common-sense reforms that made it easier to do business ­ and create jobs -- in our great state. As a result, Indiana was rated as the best Midwest state to do business in and we are among the nation's leaders in job growth. In the Hoosier state, we proved a very simple lesson: Working together is the best way to solve our problems. And Washington can do the same. By cutting spending and reducing the red tape, we can unleash our small businesses to create jobs. And with Hoosier common sense, we can balance the budget and get our nation's economy working again. American workers and American entrepreneurs are the best in the world.I'm ready to carry their torch to Washington and prove there will never be a mountain too high for us to climb. The American spirit will always persevere. Fellow Hoosiers it's your time to take back our country. Thank you and God bless! ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
