August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Tampa, Fla. ­ The following are the remarks as prepared for delivery by convention CEO Bill Harris. The actual remarks may differ. Bill Harris, Chief Executive Officer, 2012 Republican National Convention (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 Thank you, and welcome to the 2012 Republican National Convention. We are pleased to be in the great state of Florida, and especially right here in Tampa Bay. I have had the privilege of living and working here for over a year now, and I am confident you all will enjoy your visit this week. There are quite a few people who have been instrumental in getting us to this point. First of all, Governor Scott, thank you for welcoming us into your state. Mayor Buckhorn, thank you for opening your community to us. The people of Tampa Bay have been incredibly welcoming, and we appreciate their hospitality and the great support of the host committee. I'd like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the RNC team, especially Chairman Reince Priebus and COA chairman Alec Poitevint. And, while there are far too many people involved in this endeavor to thank everyone individually, I'd like to thank the 106 members of our staff, the thousands of volunteers, and acknowledge our chief operating officer, Mike Miller, who has been the foundation of our efforts. This is the third convention I've had the privilege of running and the 11th convention I've attended. I believe the convention is an important institution, not just for our candidates or for our Party, but for our democracy.Right now, our men and women in uniform around the world stand in defense of our freedoms. Our right to select a leader of our choosing is one of the most important freedoms they work to uphold. This convention is a critical step in that selection process. This convention will enable Governor Romney and Representative Ryan to communicate their message and vision for the country with the American people. As millions tune in and begin to pay attention to the fundamental issues at stake in this campaign, it is from this stage that they will begin to form their opinions and make their decisions. So, I trust you will not only enjoy the next three days, but that you will appreciate the important role you are in playing in our democratic process. Thank you. ### #Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
