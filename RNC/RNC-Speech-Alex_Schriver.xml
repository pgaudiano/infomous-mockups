I get to push back against the bastions of liberalism ­ America's colleges and universities. Every day, I'm thankful to be employed. Yet, unfortunately, many of my peers are not as lucky. Half of my generation didn't get up and go to a job this morning. Many of them, in fact 3 out of 10, graduated this year and moved back in with their parents. The fact is: we're young. We're focused. We're driven. And we need to be out making our mark on the world. Instead, our generation is having a mark made on us. Our country is nearly $16 trillion in debt ­ a burden placed on our generation's back. We're tired of it. And we're tired of a President and his cronies in Congress being all-too-willing to kick the nation's fiscal crisis down to our road. Governor Mitt Romney has a plan to get America back to work, to rein in our out-of-control spending, and to get our great country back on a sustainable path. That plan is just what we need. At the end of the day, Barack Obama has failed young Americans. We're out of jobs, we're out of "hope" and we're out of "change." Our generation can do better.</title></item><item><title>My generation deserves better. Thank you very much, God bless you! </title></item></channel></rss>
