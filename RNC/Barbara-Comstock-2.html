August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888The Hon. Barbara Comstock Deputy Permanent Co-Chair of the Convention and Member of the Virginia House of Delegates (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 Throughout his life, friends, family, businesses, charities, troubled entities, and a Commonwealth have turned to a leader ­ Mitt Romney ­ when they needed wisdom, support or a turnaround. Each time he answered the call and led. Mitt Romney, with humility, grace and diligence, has succeeded at everything he has done: as a successful governor, with a cabinet that was 50% women, at turning around the scandal-plagued Olympics, as a businessman, and as a husband, father and grandfather. He is a man uniquely prepared and committed to lead America at this critical point when we can do so much better with the right leadership. I am so pleased that this week, the American people are again meeting this man ­ this leader that so many of us who have been privileged to know and work with ­ admire and love. I am deeply honored, proud and excited to second the nomination of Mitt Romney for the office of President of the United States! ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
