August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888The Hon. Pete Sessions Chairman, National Republican Congressional Committee and U.S. Representative ­ Texas' 32nd District (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 Good afternoon. I'm Pete Sessions, a Congressman from Dallas, Texas and the Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. I'm delighted to be here with our team. Our delegates sell the fight every day, in every community across the country, as we stand up to make Barack Obama a one-term president. In 2008, I declared that we would retire Nancy Pelosi ­ and the pundits laughed. I traveled the country recruiting community leaders who, like their neighbors, were concerned for the future of America under the Pelosi-Obama regime. Together, we retired Nancy Pelosi and brought common-sense to the House by placing the gavel firmly in Speaker Boehner's hands. The fight didn't stop there. The Republican message that won us the majority in 2010 ­ implementing free enterprise policies that create jobs, cutting spending and repealing Obamacare ­ will continue to allow us to grow our House Majority, to take back the Senate and make Mitt Romney the next President of the United States. We have a diverse group of competitive candidates this cycle ­ our lead salesmen ­ that will boost the Romney-Ryan ticket. These candidates, many of whom you will hear from shortly, have the will to win. They are on offense to defeat big-government Democrats. Thank you for all you do to help us in our fight to rebuild the American Dream and God Bless America! ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
