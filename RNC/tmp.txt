It has been my pleasure to serve as chairman of the 2012 Tampa Bay Host Committee. On behalf of the Tampa Bay community, welcome. We're glad you are here. You may know that we were finalists for the last two conventions, which ultimately went to New York City and then to Minneapolis/St. Paul. Apparently, the third time is a charm. With more than 15,000 members of the media here from around the globe, I am pleased that Tampa Bay will no longer be the best kept secret in the world. For me, to stand on this stage, in this city, is the realization of a long-time dream. There has not been a convention for either party in the state of Florida since 1972. That same year, I was a delegate to the convention in Miami Beach. I have been a delegate or alternate at every convention since then. And I've been working hard at building my community, and creating jobs and opportunity for the Tampa Bay area. Having you all here in this Forum will have a significant impact on the future of our region. Because you chose us, thousands of people have the opportunity to get to know our people, our businesses, our attractions -- and our food.</title></item><item><title>You are creating jobs for caterers, waiters, taxi drivers, and so many more Floridians. And you are filling up hotel rooms that often sit empty after the summer tourism season ends and families head back for their children to start school. So thank you for stimulating our economy. Hundreds of volunteers have spent countless hours to prepare for the next few days. We trust that you will enjoy our city and our hospitality, and that you come back often. Thank you for entrusting us with the great honor of hosting the 2012 Republican National Convention. </title></item></channel></rss>

I get to push back against the bastions of liberalism ­ America's colleges and universities. Every day, I'm thankful to be employed. Yet, unfortunately, many of my peers are not as lucky. Half of my generation didn't get up and go to a job this morning. Many of them, in fact 3 out of 10, graduated this year and moved back in with their parents. The fact is: we're young. We're focused. We're driven. And we need to be out making our mark on the world. Instead, our generation is having a mark made on us. Our country is nearly $16 trillion in debt ­ a burden placed on our generation's back. We're tired of it. And we're tired of a President and his cronies in Congress being all-too-willing to kick the nation's fiscal crisis down to our road. Governor Mitt Romney has a plan to get America back to work, to rein in our out-of-control spending, and to get our great country back on a sustainable path. That plan is just what we need. At the end of the day, Barack Obama has failed young Americans. We're out of jobs, we're out of "hope" and we're out of "change." Our generation can do better.</title></item><item><title>My generation deserves better. Thank you very much, God bless you! </title></item></channel></rss>

But President Obama doesn't care. Coal provides Kentuckians with some of the lowest electricity costs in America ­ enabling companies like Toyota to create 7,000 jobs in Georgetown, Kentucky. But President Obama doesn't care. This year alone, 2,000 Kentucky miners lost their jobs because of Obama's "War on Coal." For every mining job lost, three additional jobs are threatened, including those at Toyota. But President Obama doesn't care. Rarely in history has a single industry been so ruthlessly attacked with so little regard for the people it hurts. People like Chris Woods, a young coal miner who took me underground to show me his work. Chris considers himself lucky. He still has a job, driving an hour each way, for a 10-hour shift. His paycheck supports his wife, two kids and both sets of parents. Chris looked me in the eyes. I'll never forget his words:</title></item><item><title>"Andy, I don't know much about politics, and frankly I don't care about politics. But if you can save my job, I'm for you." Chris, I care about your job. Mitt Romney cares about your job. And together, we're going to fight to save your job! </title></item></channel></rss>
Ann Romney,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Ann Romney</title><description>Remarks of Ann Romney to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Luce, thank you for that kind introduction. I want to talk to you tonight not about politics and not about party. And while there are many important issues we'll hear discussed in this convention and throughout this campaign, tonight I want to talk to you from my heart about our hearts. I want to talk not about what divides us, but what holds us together as an American family. I want to talk to you tonight about that one great thing that unites us, that one thing that brings us our greatest joy when times are good, and the deepest solace in our dark hours. Tonight I want to talk to you about love. I want to talk to you about the deep and abiding love I have for a man I met at a dance many years ago. And the profound love I have, and I know we share, for this country. I want to talk to you about that love so deep only a mother can fathom it -- the love we have for our children and our children's children. And I want us to think tonight about the love we all share for those Americans, our brothers and sisters, who are going through difficult times, whose days are never easy, nights are always long, and whose work never seems done. They are here among us tonight in this hall; they are here in neighborhoods across Tampa and all across America. The parents who lie awake at night side by side, wondering how they'll be able to pay the mortgage or make the rent; the single dad who's working extra hours tonight, so that his kids can buy some new clothes to go back to school, can take a school trip or play a sport, so his kids can feel... like the other kids. And the working moms who love their jobs but would like to work just a little less to spend more time with the kids, but that's just out of the question with this economy. Or that couple who would like to have another child, but wonder how will they afford it.</title></item><item><title>I've been all across this country for the past year and a half and heard these stories of how hard it is to get ahead now. I've heard your voices: "I'm running in place," "we just can't get ahead." Sometimes I think that late at night, if we were all silent for just a few moments and listened carefully, we could hear a great collective sigh from the moms and dads across America who made it through another day, and know that they'll make it through another one tomorrow. But in that end of the day moment, they just aren't sure how. And if you listen carefully, you'll hear the women sighing a little bit more than the men. It's how it is, isn't it? It's the moms who always have to work a little harder, to make everything right. It's the moms of this nation -- single, married, widowed -- who really hold this country together. We're the mothers, we're the wives, we're the grandmothers, we're the big sisters, we're the little sisters, we're the daughters. You know it's true, don't you? You're the ones who always have to do a little more. You know what it's like to work a little harder during the day to earn the respect you deserve at work and then come home to help with that book report which just has to be done. You know what those late night phone calls with an elderly parent are like and the long weekend drives just to see how they're doing. You know the fastest route to the local emergency room and which doctors actually answer the phone when you call at night. You know what it's like to sit in that graduation ceremony and wonder how it was that so many long days turned into years that went by so quickly. You are the best of America. You are the hope of America. There would not be an America without you. Tonight, we salute you and sing your praises. I'm not sure if men really understand this, but I don't think there's a woman in America who really expects her life to be easy. In our own ways, we all know better! And that's fine. We don't want easy. But these last few years have been harder than they needed to be. It's all the little things -- that price at the pump you just can't believe, the grocery bills that just get bigger; all those things that used to be free, like school sports, are now one more bill to pay. It's all the little things that pile up to become big things. And the big things -- the good jobs, the chance at college, that home you want to buy, just get harder. Everything has become harder. We're too smart to know there aren't easy answers. But we're not dumb enough to accept that there aren't better answers. And that is where this boy I met at a high school dance comes in. His name is Mitt Romney and you really should get to know him. I could tell you why I fell in love with him -- he was tall, laughed a lot, was nervous -- girls like that, it shows the guy's a little intimidated -- and he was nice to my parents but he was really glad when my parents weren't around. That's a good thing. And he made me laugh. I am the granddaughter of a Welsh coal miner who was determined that his kids get out of the mines. My dad got his first job when he was six years old, in a little village in Wales called Nantyffyllon, cleaning bottles at the Colliers Arms. When he was 15, dad came to America. In our country, he saw hope and an opportunity to escape from poverty. He moved to a small town in the great state of Michigan. There, he started a business -- one he built himself, by the way. He raised a family. And he became mayor of our town. My dad would often remind my brothers and me how fortunate we were to grow up in a place like America. He wanted us to have every opportunity that came with life in this country -- and so he pushed us to be our best and give our all. Inside the houses that lined the streets of our town, there were a lot of good fathers teaching their sons and daughters those same values. I didn't know it at the time, but one of those dads was my future father-in-law, George Romney. Mitt's dad never graduated from college. Instead, he became a carpenter. He worked hard, and he became the head of a car company, and then the governor of Michigan. When Mitt and I met and fell in love, we were determined not to let anything stand in the way of our life together. I was an Episcopalian. He was a Mormon. We were very young. Both still in college. There were many reasons to delay marriage, and you know? We just didn't care. We got married and moved into a basement apartment. We walked to class together, shared the housekeeping, and ate a lot of pasta and tuna fish. Our desk was a door propped up on sawhorses. Our dining room table was a fold down ironing board in the kitchen. Those were very special days. Then our first son came along. All at once I'm 22 years old, with a baby and a husband who's going to business school and law school at the same time, and I can tell you, probably like every other girl who finds herself in a new life far from family and friends, with a new baby and a new husband, that it dawned on me that I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into. That was 42 years ago. Now we have five sons and 18 grandchildren and I'm still in love with that boy I met at a high school dance. I read somewhere that Mitt and I have a "storybook marriage." Well, in the storybooks I read, there were never long, long, rainy winter afternoons in a house with five boys screaming at once. And those storybooks never seemed to have chapters called MS or Breast Cancer. A storybook marriage? No, not at all. What Mitt Romney and I have is a real marriage. I know this good and decent man for what he is -- warm and loving and patient. He has tried to live his life with a set of values centered on family, faith, and love of one's fellow man. From the time we were first married, I've seen him spend countless hours helping others. I've seen him drop everything to help a friend in trouble, and been there when late-night calls of panic came from a member of our church whose child had been taken to the hospital. You may not agree with Mitt's positions on issues or his politics. Massachusetts is only 13% Republican, so it's not like that's a shock. But let me say this to every American who is thinking about who should be our next President: No one will work harder. No one will care more. No one will move heaven and earth like Mitt Romney to make this country a better place to live! It's true that Mitt has been successful at each new challenge he has taken on. It amazes me to see his history of success actually being attacked. Are those really the values that made our country great? As a mom of five boys, do we want to raise our children to be afraid of success? Do we send our children out in the world with the advice, "Try to do... okay?" And let's be honest. If the last four years had been more successful, do we really think there would be this attack on Mitt Romney's success? Of course not.</title></item><item><title>Mitt will be the first to tell you that he is the most fortunate man in the world. He had two loving parents who gave him strong values and taught him the value of work. He had the chance to get the education his father never had. But as his partner on this amazing journey, I can tell you Mitt Romney was not handed success. He built it. He stayed in Massachusetts after graduate school and got a job. I saw the long hours that started with that first job. I was there when he and a small group of friends talked about starting a new company. I was there when they struggled and wondered if the whole idea just wasn't going to work. Mitt's reaction was to work harder and press on. Today that company has become another great American success story. Has it made those who started the company successful beyond their dreams? Yes, it has. It allowed us to give our sons the chance at good educations and made all those long hours of book reports and homework worth every minute. It's given us the deep satisfaction of being able to help others in ways that we could never have imagined. Mitt doesn't like to talk about how he has helped others because he sees it as a privilege, not a political talking point. And we're no different than the millions of Americans who quietly help their neighbors, their churches and their communities. They don't do it so that others will think more of them. They do it because there IS no greater joy. "Give and it shall be given unto you." But because this is America, that small company which grew has helped so many others lead better lives. The jobs that grew from the risks they took have become college educations, first homes. That success has helped fund scholarships, pensions, and retirement funds. This is the genius of America: dreams fulfilled help others launch new dreams. At every turn in his life, this man I met at a high school dance, has helped lift up others. He did it with the Olympics, when many wanted to give up. He did it in Massachusetts, where he guided a state from economic crisis to unemployment of just 4.7%. Under Mitt, Massachusetts's schools were the best in the nation. The best. He started the John and Abigail Adams scholarships, which give the top 25% of high school graduates a four-year tuition-free scholarship. This is the man America needs.</title></item><item><title>This is the man who will wake up every day with the determination to solve the problems that others say can't be solved, to fix what others say is beyond repair. This is the man who will work harder than anyone so that we can work a little less hard. I can't tell you what will happen over the next four years. But I can only stand here tonight, as a wife, a mother, a grandmother, an American, and make you this solemn commitment: This man will not fail. This man will not let us down. This man will lift up America! It has been 47 years since that tall, kind of charming young man brought me home from our first dance. Not every day since has been easy. But he still makes me laugh. And never once did I have a single reason to doubt that I was the luckiest woman in the world. I said tonight I wanted to talk to you about love. Look into your hearts. This is our country. This is our future. These are our children and grandchildren. You can trust Mitt. He loves America. He will take us to a better place, just as he took me home safely from that dance. Give him that chance. Give America that chance. God bless each of you and God Bless the United States of America.</title></item></channel></rss>
Artur Davis,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Artur Davis</title><description>Remarks of Artur Davis to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. Some of you may know, the last time I spoke at a convention, it turned out I was in the wrong place. So, Tampa, my fellow Republicans, thank you for welcoming me where I belong. We have a country to turn around. This week you will nominate the most experienced executive to seek the presidency in 60 years in Mitt Romney. He has no illusions about what makes America great, and he doesn't confuse the presidency with celebrity, or loftiness with leadership. What a difference four years makes. The Democrats' ads convince me that Governor Romney can't sing, but his record convinces me he knows how to lead, and I think you know which skill we need more. Now, America is a land of second chances, and I gather you have room for the estimated 6 million of us who know we got it wrong in 2008 and who want to fix it. Maybe we should have known that night in Denver that things that begin with plywood Greek columns and artificial smoke typically don't end well. Maybe the Hollywood stars and the glamour blinded us a little: you thought it was the glare, some of us thought it was a halo. But in all seriousness, do you know why so many of us believed? We led with our hearts and our dreams that we could be more inclusive than America had ever been, and no candidate had ever spoken so beautifully.</title></item><item><title>But dreams meet daybreak: the jobless know what I mean, so do the families who wonder how this Administration could wreck a recovery for three years and counting. So many of those high-flown words have faded. Remember the President saying of negative politics and untrue ads, "not this time?" Who knew "not this time" just meant "not unless the economy is still stuck and we can't run on our record?" Remember, too, when he said, "this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal?" Who knew the plain English version of it was, "middle America, get ready to shell out 60 bucks to fill up your car?" And in terms of their crown jewel legislative achievement: who knew that when asked, "will government impose a new federal mandate requiring middle class Americans to buy health insurance whether they can afford it or not?" The answer would be "Yes we can!" So, this time, in the name of 23 million of our children and parents and brothers and sisters who are officially unemployed, underemployed, or who have stopped looking for work, let's put the poetry aside, let's suspend the hype, let's come down to earth and start creating jobs again. This time, instead of moving oceans and healing planets, let's get our bills in order and pay down the debt so we control our own future. And of course, we know that opportunity lies outside the reach of some of our people. We don't need flowery words about inequality to tell us that, and we don't need a party that has led while poverty and hunger rose to record levels to give us lectures about suffering. Ladies and gentlemen, there are Americans who are listening to this speech tonight who haven't always been with you, and I want you to let me talk -- just to them ­ for a moment. I know how loaded up our politics is with anger and animosity, but I have to believe we can still make a case over the raised voices. There are Americans who voted for the president, but who are searching right now, because they know that their votes didn't build the country they wanted. To those Democrats and independents whose minds are open to argument: listen closely to the Democratic Party that will gather in Charlotte and ask yourself if you ever hear your voice in the clamor.</title></item><item><title>Ask yourself if these Democrats still speak for you. When they say we have a duty to grow government even when we can't afford it, does it sound like compassion to you -- or recklessness? When you hear the party that glorified Occupy Wall Street blast success; when you hear them minimize the genius of the men and women who make jobs out of nothing, is that what you teach your children about work? When they tell you America is this unequal place where the powerful trample on the powerless, does that sound like the country your children or your spouse risked their lives for in Iraq or Afghanistan? Do you even recognize the America they are talking about? And what can we say about a house that doesn't honor the pictures on its walls? John F. Kennedy asked us what we could do for America. This Democratic Party asks what can government give you. Don't worry about paying the bill, it's on your kids and grandkids. Bill Clinton took on his base and made welfare a thing you had to work for; this current crowd guts the welfare work requirement in the dead of night. Bill Clinton, Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson reached out across the aisle and said meet me in the middle; but their party rammed through a healthcare bill that took over one-sixth of our economy, without accepting a single Republican idea, without winning a single vote in either house from a party whose constituents make up about 50 percent of the country. You know, the Democrats used to have a night when they presented a film of their presidential legends: if they do it in Charlotte, the theme song should be this year's hit, "Somebody That I Used to Know." My fellow Americans, when great athletes falter, their coaches sometimes whisper to them "remember who you are." It's a call to their greatness at a moment when their bodies and spirit are too sapped to remember their strength. This sweet, blessed, God-inspired place called America is a champion that has absorbed some blows. But while we bend, we don't break. This is no dark hour; this is the dawn before we remember who we are. May it be said of this time in our history: 2008 to 2011: lesson learned. 2012: mistake corrected.</title></item><item><title>God bless you, God bless America. Thank you </title></item></channel></rss>

Each time he answered the call and led. Mitt Romney, with humility, grace and diligence, has succeeded at everything he has done: as a successful governor, with a cabinet that was 50% women, at turning around the scandal-plagued Olympics, as a businessman, and as a husband, father and grandfather. He is a man uniquely prepared and committed to lead America at this critical point when we can do so much better with the right leadership. I am so pleased that this week, the American people are again meeting this man ­ this leader that so many of us who have been privileged to know and work with ­ admire and love.

What started with entrepreneurs arriving in Jamestown in 1607 ­ and grew with the wisdom of Washington, Jefferson, Madison ­ shaped a nation and the world. Lovers of freedom and liberty, members of all races and religions ­ from across the globe ­ now live and prosper in Virginia, which is rated one of the best places to live, work, start a business, and raise a family. Over the past four years, we in Virginia have kept the American Dream alive by observing the President's policies ­ and DOING THE OPPOSITE. If reelected, President Obama would double down on his job-destroying policies: ·He promises to raise our taxes and hurt working families. ·He mocks our right-to-work laws. ·His budget failure threatens to slash 200,000 national security and high-tech jobs in Virginia. ·His war on success undermines individual initiative and innovation. Obama isn't working. President Mitt Romney and Vice President Paul Ryan WILL. They have a common-sense plan to reward and unleash our entrepreneurs and innovators and put America back to work. They will be unapologetic in championing the American Dream. In 70 days, let's renew our Founding Fathers' victory for freedom.</title></item><item><title>Let's guarantee that our children and their children continue this American story of freedom, opportunity and prosperity for all. </title></item></channel></rss>

Imagine, working every day for four years without a paycheck. I did. I worked while our children, Jessica and Kevin, played and napped. And after I tucked them into bed, I worked. Our first nine months, we had one client -- a client who waited six months to pay us. We sustained our business by tapping into our personal credit cards and borrowing against our home. The commitments, expenses and the stress kept us up at night, but we were determined to build a successful business. And after several years of hard work, long hours, no pay and low pay, we did. Today, Exhibit Edge employs 20 people and helps businesses grow through trade show marketing. When those businesses grow, they employ people. The President said that business owners didn't get there on our own. Well, he's wrong. We risked everything and succeeded because of our hard work and commitment. What President Obama doesn't understand is that when businesses grow, unemployment goes down and people thrive. We need a president who understands the value of entrepreneurship.</title></item><item><title>Governor Romney knows and, more importantly, appreciates what it takes to build a successful business, and that's why I'm supporting Mitt Romney. </title></item></channel></rss>

We are pleased to be in the great state of Florida, and especially right here in Tampa Bay. I have had the privilege of living and working here for over a year now, and I am confident you all will enjoy your visit this week. There are quite a few people who have been instrumental in getting us to this point. First of all, Governor Scott, thank you for welcoming us into your state. Mayor Buckhorn, thank you for opening your community to us. The people of Tampa Bay have been incredibly welcoming, and we appreciate their hospitality and the great support of the host committee. I'd like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the RNC team, especially Chairman Reince Priebus and COA chairman Alec Poitevint. And, while there are far too many people involved in this endeavor to thank everyone individually, I'd like to thank the 106 members of our staff, the thousands of volunteers, and acknowledge our chief operating officer, Mike Miller, who has been the foundation of our efforts. This is the third convention I've had the privilege of running and the 11th convention I've attended. I believe the convention is an important institution, not just for our candidates or for our Party, but for our democracy.</title></item><item><title>Right now, our men and women in uniform around the world stand in defense of our freedoms. Our right to select a leader of our choosing is one of the most important freedoms they work to uphold. This convention is a critical step in that selection process. This convention will enable Governor Romney and Representative Ryan to communicate their message and vision for the country with the American people. As millions tune in and begin to pay attention to the fundamental issues at stake in this campaign, it is from this stage that they will begin to form their opinions and make their decisions. So, I trust you will not only enjoy the next three days, but that you will appreciate the important role you are in playing in our democratic process. Thank you.</title></item></channel></rss>

Your faith and trust in us is much appreciated. Now, let me tell you about my city. We were built by people who worked hard and dreamed big. Immigrant families came here from Germany, Spain, Italy, and Cuba. They were cigar rollers and port workers. They were the economic engine that powered Tampa Bay. Today, we are a city that represents all that is good about America. We are leading Florida out of the recession. Unemployment is declining faster here than almost anywhere else. We are one of the fastest growing cities in the country. We've been called one of the best American cities to do business. We are attracting some of the brightest young people who want to be part of our tech industry. We are curing diseases -- on the cutting edge of science and health care.</title></item><item><title>And, Tampa remains proud to be the home of MacDill Air Force Base - the headquarters of the United States Central Command and Special Operations Command. I can tell you with certainty that we are open for business and are ready to embrace all that the future holds. As mayor, I stand here today representing an extraordinary group of law enforcement, fire rescue personnel, and thousands of local volunteers. They have worked hard to make this convention a success. Each of them, proud Americans, excited to be part of the democratic process and eager to tell Tampa's story to the world. I trust you will fall in love with our city just as I do every day. Have a great week in Tampa! </title></item></channel></rss>

I appreciate the diligent work of the 112 men and women from 50 states and six territories who served on that committee. They discussed, debated and delivered. It was a good team. I want to thank my co-chairs, Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. And I thank the staff of the RNC who conducted countless meetings and conference calls to compose this document. We have outlined a conservative vision of governance, a document that is many things--an indictment, a blueprint and a declaration of values. It is an invitation and a pledge. First, it is an indictment of the failed policies of the current administration's record of debt, job losses and government overreach. More importantly, our platform is a blueprint for rebuilding the cherished American dream. It is an overview of our conservative principles and detailed policies for how we jumpstart economic growth and job creation.</title></item><item><title>This ambitious blueprint projects a sea change in the way government works. It offers solutions for workers without jobs, families without savings and neighborhoods without hope. This platform addresses the elderly who are worried about Medicare. It tells the truth about Obamacare and the need to repeal and replace it. This blueprint lays out a bold agenda for government reform -- a government that operates to serve the people better at less cost. States are going to take center stage in the long-overdue renewal of American society. By reclaiming management of education. By reforming Medicaid and welfare programs. By managing environmental problems locally. By enacting a comprehensive energy policy. This platform affirms the traditional meaning of marriage and the sanctity of human life, defends religious freedom and Second Amendment rights and calls for a balanced budget amendment. This platform is an invitation. It invites every American to consider what kind of country we want to be. An America where every person matters, every worker has an opportunity to work and every family can aspire to a better future. We invite Americans to consider this platform: a call for dramatic change in government, from stagnation to prosperity, from an entitlement society to an opportunity society. This platform is a pledge. We will restore American leadership in the world and honor our courageous men and women in uniform. We will stand by our friends and stand against those who dare to harm us. That is your platform. I urge its adoption.</title></item><item><title>It is now my great pleasure to introduce one of my co-chairs of the platform committee, the outstanding senator and former governor from the state of North Dakota, John Hoeven. Please give him a warm welcome! </title></item></channel></rss>
Pam Bondi and Sam Olens,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Pam Bondi and Sam Olens</title><description>Remarks of Pam Bondi and Sam Olens to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>As Attorneys General, we have been on the front line defending the Constitution ­ and the American people ­ from a President driven to exercise government power over our freedoms, our rights, and our lives. We know that the Constitution limits federal power, but President Obama clearly believes those limits just get in his way. So he ignores them. Time and again. He promises to rescue our economy and environment by investing in green jobs, but instead funnels tax dollars into campaign donors' pockets. He promised to have the most transparent administration in history but now refuses to come clean with Congress and the American people about Fast and Furious. He talks about giving us more control over health-care decisions, but instead grants that power to government bureaucrats. He claims that government is responsible for private sector success, but the only thing he is building is bigger government. And Obamacare is Exhibit A. </title></item><item><title> It distorts our Constitution and endangers our fragile economy. We did everything in our power to stop it, taking the fight all the way to the United States Supreme Court.</title></item><item><title>We prevailed on our two main arguments: BONDI: The Court agreed that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution does not allow the federal government to force you to purchase a product you don't want. The Court agreed that the Constitution does not allow the federal government to force states to adopt a budget-busting expansion of Medicaid. </title></item><item><title> Then came the shocker: The Supreme Court upheld the individual insurance mandate by calling it something the President swore it never was ­ a tax. At every stage of the process, President Obama and Congressional Democrats promised us that the mandate was not a tax. Because they knew Americans were hurting, and the last thing we needed was another tax! Because they knew ­ if the American public were told that Obamacare was just a massive tax hike, they wouldn't have a prayer of passing it. BONDI: Instead, President Obama and the Democrats called it a mandate. Then they turned around, and without a shred of shame, asked the Court to call the mandate a tax. Yet, the President can't bring himself to acknowledge publicly that the only reason his "'Unaffordable Care Act" still stands ­ is because it is a tax. This is what happens when a President has such total disregard for our individual liberty that he knowingly and purposely imposes unwarranted restrictions against the will of the people. This is not why our Founding Fathers risked their lives and their fortunes when they created a nation. This is not why young American men and women today risk their lives in defense of freedom. OLENS and BONDI: So, tonight, we ask you: BONDI: Do you want skyrocketing health insurance premiums? </title></item><item><title> Do you want enormous new financial burdens on young people who already shoulder our nation's crushing debt? BONDI: Do you want the government to force individuals and religious institutions to violate the tenets of their faith? </title></item><item><title> Do you want over $1 trillion in tax increases? BONDI: Do you want a job-destroying insurance mandate that strangles businesses?</title></item><item><title>Do you want a federal government that tells you what to do, what to think, or what to buy when it comes to your health care? BONDI: Do you want the federal government to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare to hide the true costs of Obamacare? </title></item><item><title> Do you want more of this for four more years? The health care lawsuit has reminded all of us that the Constitution limits the power of government. It has reminded us of the precious relationship between federalism and individual liberty. And though we fundamentally disagree with his decision, Chief Justice Roberts did observe that it is not the Supreme Court's "job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices." BONDI: It is our job to make a new choice. It is time to stand up and say, in a loud, clear voice, "Enough!" It is time to repeal Obamacare! It is time to stop those who ignore the Constitution when it's expedient! It is time to remember that our rights are not a gift from government, but from God, and that by His grace we will defend them! It is time for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Thank you! </title></item></channel></rss>
Brian Sandoval,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Brian Sandoval</title><description>Remarks of Brian Sandoval to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Thank you. I stand here tonight humbled to share with you the story of a nation, a state and of one man. It is the story of America itself ­ of courageous, freedom-loving visionaries who believed in the promise of opportunity, rather than the divine right of kings. Who dared to dream that anyone could rise above the circumstances of their birth. It is also the story of the great Silver State: Battle Born Nevada! We joined the Union to help keep Abraham Lincoln in the White House and fulfill the promise of opportunity, as he ended forever the scourge of slavery. And, it is my story: the child of working-class Hispanic Americans who has lived the American dream. The Proverbs tell us "from small beginnings come great things." My father was one of ten children. My mother and her family lived in a tiny, two-bedroom house in the Southwest. Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life. When I was a boy, my parents brought us to Nevada in search of opportunity. My first job was cleaning sheep pens. In college, I worked in a hospital cafeteria. I worked my way through law school. Encouraged by my parents' love for this country, I dreamed of public service. I became a state legislator, a gaming regulator, and attorney general of my state. My story could end there, but this is America.</title></item><item><title>And so, in 2005, a simple son of promise was appointed by President Bush, and confirmed by the United States Senate as a federal judge. I saw in my courtroom the fulfillment of all that our forefathers sought to create. A nation of laws. A nation of due process and merit and justice for all. And, yes, a nation of immigrants. One of the greatest duties I performed was to administer the oath of citizenship to new Americans ­ immigrants who embody our dream of opportunity and prosperity. But from the federal bench, I also saw a nation beset on all sides by unprecedented challenges. I watched my state's economy falter, stagnate and slide into decline. Nevadans lost their jobs and their homes. Nevada was hit hardest by the recession ­ highest unemployment, highest foreclosure rate, highest bankruptcy rate. Like so many, I looked around for help. And what did I find? A president who promised change, but turned instead to the same tired strategy of ever-larger government. A president who abandoned hope and embraced only blame. So I stepped down from a lifetime appointment to make a difference. I ran for governor, was elected and, like Republican governors all across this nation, I chose to make the tough decisions: On issues like economic development, education reform and redesigning how state government operates. On job creation, and reducing state spending, and eliminating red tape. It hasn't been easy. And we're not through it yet. But I have put my faith in the people of my great state ­ because they are the ones who will grow our economy. I have seen Hispanic business owners and families from backgrounds -- not unlike my own -struggle in this economy. I have seen young children from all walks of life begin to wonder if their future holds any hope at all. Make no mistake: The current administration's failed experiment with big government gets in the way of economic recovery. Their love affair with government regulation is a drag on business confidence. From personal experience, I can tell you what will help states like Nevada and families like mine: elect the team that understands how to get America working again.</title></item><item><title>Send Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to the White House! This administration sings the siren song that this is all there is. They tell us government is the answer, but we know it's the problem. They tell us we didn't build our businesses, but somebody else made it happen. They tell us not to dream but to settle. You and I know America is better than that. Our national story is one of confronting challenges ­ and winning. We have overcome economic devastation, defeated mighty oppressors and lifted up generation after generation of Americans. We can ­ and we will ­ do it again. For that is our birthright as members of the American family ­ white, black, Hispanic, Asian, immigrant or descendent of the Founding Fathers themselves. We must leave Tampa this week on a mission to remind Americans they deserve more than the status quo. They deserve to dream big. We must remind Americans that the promise of opportunity remains unbroken ­ that every person in this great nation can succeed through hard work, courage and personal responsibility. For that is the real American story. Thank you. And now, let me introduce to you one of those Hispanic business owners that I mentioned are struggling in this economy, Mr. Phil Archuletta of New Mexico.</title></item></channel></rss>
Cathy McMorris Rodgers,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Cathy McMorris Rodgers</title><description>Remarks of Cathy McMorris Rodgers to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Good evening ladies and gentleman. Thank you. My name is Cathy McMorris Rogers, and I am proud to represent eastern Washington in Congress. Tonight, we're going to do things a little differently. I have the pleasure of being your host for the night guiding you through the next few hours. I'm delighted to report that we have a wonderful lineup for you. Each speaker will be joining together to send a message to President Obama. And that message is three simple words: We built it. Before I ran for office I worked in my family's business, the Peach Crest Fruit Basket, for 13 years. I worked hard every day, and I can assure you that my family built that business from the ground up. Today, that hands-on experience guides my decision-making in Congress. Unlike President Obama, I know that small businesses are the true engine of our economy ­ not the government ­ and what businesses need to grow and create jobs is less taxes and regulation, not more. Tonight you'll hear a variety of stories from people who work hard every day to build our economy. You'll hear from Jack Gilchrist, the owner of a family-owned metal fabricating business in New Hampshire.</title></item><item><title>A number of our nation's leading governors are with us tonight. The chief executives from states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Nevada and Virginia ­ places where they have created an environment that unleashes American ingenuity instead of stifling it. They will tell us how the job creators in their communities aren't found in the state house ­ they're found on Main Street. And one of the speakers I'm most looking forward to hearing from tonight is someone who I think we all can agree will make a fabulous First Lady, Ann Romney. To close out the evening, we will hear from a dynamic and engaging leader who is shaking up the way they do business in New Jersey ­ Governor Chris Christie. So let's get started. Our next speaker is from the Granite State and was elected to the United States Senate in 2010. Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Kelly Ayotte. </title></item></channel></rss>
Chris Christie,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Chris Christie</title><description>Remarks of Chris Christie to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>This stage and this moment are very improbable for me. A New Jersey Republican delivering the keynote address to our national convention, from a state with 700,000 more Democrats than Republicans. A New Jersey Republican stands before you tonight. Proud of my party, proud of my state and proud of my country. I am the son of an Irish father and a Sicilian mother. My Dad, who I am blessed to have with me here tonight, is gregarious, outgoing and loveable. My Mom, who I lost 8 years ago, was the enforcer. She made sure we all knew who set the rules. In the automobile of life, Dad was just a passenger. Mom was the driver. They both lived hard lives. Dad grew up in poverty. After returning from Army service, he worked at the Breyers Ice Cream plant in the 1950s. With that job and the G.I. bill he put himself through Rutgers University at night to become the first in his family to earn a college degree. Our first family picture was on his graduation day, with Mom beaming next to him, six months pregnant with me. Mom also came from nothing. She was raised by a single mother who took three buses to get to work every day. And mom spent the time she was supposed to be a kid actually raising children ­ her two younger siblings. She was tough as nails and didn't suffer fools at all. The truth was she couldn't afford to. She spoke the truth ­ bluntly, directly and without much varnish. I am her son. I was her son as I listened to "Darkness on the Edge of Town" with my high school friends on the Jersey Shore. I was her son as I moved into a studio apartment with Mary Pat to start a marriage that is now 26 years old.</title></item><item><title>I was her son as I coached our sons Andrew and Patrick on the fields of Mendham, and as I watched with pride as our daughters Sarah and Bridget marched with their soccer teams in the Labor Day parade. And I am still her son today, as Governor, following the rules she taught me: to speak from the heart and to fight for your principles. She never thought you get extra credit for just speaking the truth. The greatest lesson Mom ever taught me, though, was this one: she told me there would be times in your life when you have to choose between being loved and being respected. She said to always pick being respected, that love without respect was always fleeting -- but that respect could grow into real, lasting love. Now, of course, she was talking about women. But I have learned over time that it applies just as much to leadership. In fact, I think that advice applies to America today more than ever. I believe we have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved. Our founding fathers had the wisdom to know that social acceptance and popularity is fleeting and that this country's principles needed to be rooted in strengths greater than the passions and emotions of the times. Our leaders today have decided it is more important to be popular, to do what is easy and say "yes," rather than to say no when "no" is what's required. In recent years, we as a country have too often chosen the same path. It's been easy for our leaders to say not us, and not now, in taking on the tough issues. And we've stood silently by and let them get away with it. But tonight, I say enough. I say, together, let's make a much different choice. Tonight, we are speaking up for ourselves and stepping up. We are beginning to do what is right and what is necessary to make our country great again. We are demanding that our leaders stop tearing each other down, and work together to take action on the big things facing America. Tonight, we choose respect over love. We are not afraid. We are taking our country back. We are the great grandchildren of men and women who broke their backs in the name of American ingenuity; the grandchildren of the Greatest Generation; the sons and daughters of immigrants; the brothers and sisters of everyday heroes; the neighbors of entrepreneurs and firefighters, teachers and farmers, veterans and factory workers and everyone in-between who shows up not just on the big days or the good days, but on the bad days and on the hard days. Each and every day. All 365 of them.</title></item><item><title>We are the United States of America. Now we must lead the way our citizens live. To lead as my mother insisted I live, not by avoiding truths, especially the hard ones, but by facing up to them and being the better for it.</title></item><item><title>We cannot afford to do anything less. I know because this was the challenge in New Jersey. When I came into office, I could continue on the same path that led to wealth, jobs and people leaving the state or I could do the job the people elected me to do ­ to do the big things. There were those who said it couldn't be done. The problems were too big, too politically charged, too broken to fix. But we were on a path we could no longer afford to follow. They said it was impossible to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in eight years. That it was impossible to balance a budget at the same time, with an $11 billion deficit. Three years later, we have three balanced budgets with lower taxes. We did it. They said it was impossible to touch the third rail of politics. To take on the public sector unions and to reform a pension and health benefit system that was headed to bankruptcy. With bipartisan leadership we saved taxpayers $132 billion over 30 years and saved retirees their pension. We did it. They said it was impossible to speak the truth to the teachers union. They were just too powerful. Real teacher tenure reform that demands accountability and ends the guarantee of a job for life regardless of performance would never happen. For the first time in 100 years with bipartisan support, we did it. The disciples of yesterday's politics underestimated the will of the people. They assumed our people were selfish; that when told of the difficult problems, tough choices and complicated solutions, they would simply turn their backs, that they would decide it was every man for himself. Instead, the people of New Jersey stepped up and shared in the sacrifice. They rewarded politicians who led instead of politicians who pandered. We shouldn't be surprised. We've never been a country to shy away from the truth. History shows that we stand up when it counts and it's this quality that has defined our character and our significance in the world. I know this simple truth and I'm not afraid to say it: our ideas are right for America and their ideas have failed America.</title></item><item><title>Let's be clear with the American people tonight. Here's what we believe as Republicans and what they believe as Democrats. We believe in telling hard working families the truth about our country's fiscal realities. Telling them what they already know ­ the math of federal spending doesn't add up. With $5 trillion in debt added over the last four years, we have no other option but to make the hard choices, cut federal spending and fundamentally reduce the size of government. They believe that the American people don't want to hear the truth about the extent of our fiscal difficulties and need to be coddled by big government. They believe the American people are content to live the lie with them. We believe in telling seniors the truth about our overburdened entitlements. We know seniors not only want these programs to survive, but they just as badly want them secured for their grandchildren. Seniors are not selfish. They believe seniors will always put themselves ahead of their grandchildren. So they prey on their vulnerabilities and scare them with misinformation for the cynical purpose of winning the next election. Their plan: whistle a happy tune while driving us off the fiscal cliff, as long as they are behind the wheel of power. We believe that the majority of teachers in America know our system must be reformed to put students first so that America can compete. Teachers don't teach to become rich or famous. They teach because they love children. We believe that we should honor and reward the good ones while doing what's best for our nation's future ­ demanding accountability, higher standards and the best teacher in every classroom. They believe the educational establishment will always put themselves ahead of children. That self-interest trumps common sense. They believe in pitting unions against teachers, educators against parents, and lobbyists against children. They believe in teacher's unions. We believe in teachers. We believe that if we tell the people the truth they will act bigger than the pettiness of Washington, D.C. We believe it's possible to forge bipartisan compromise and stand up for conservative principles. It's the power of our ideas, not of our rhetoric, that attracts people to our Party.</title></item><item><title>We win when we make it about what needs to be done; we lose when we play along with their game of scaring and dividing. For make no mistake, the problems are too big to let the American people lose ­ the slowest economic recovery in decades, a spiraling out of control deficit, an education system that's failing to compete in the world. It doesn't matter how we got here. There is enough blame to go around. What matters now is what we do. I know we can fix our problems. When there are people in the room who care more about doing the job they were elected to do than worrying about winning re-election, it's possible to work together, achieve principled compromise and get results. The people have no patience for any other way. It's simple. We need politicians to care more about doing something and less about being something. Believe me, if we can do this in a blue state with a conservative Republican Governor, Washington is out of excuses. Leadership delivers. Leadership counts. Leadership matters. We have this leader for America. We have a nominee who will tell us the truth and who will lead with conviction. And now he has a running mate who will do the same. We have Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan, and we must make them our next President and Vice President. Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to put us back on the path to growth and create good paying private sector jobs again in America. Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the torrent of debt that is compromising our future and burying our economy. Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the debacle of putting the world's greatest health care system in the hands of federal bureaucrats and putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor. We ended an era of absentee leadership without purpose or principle in New Jersey. It's time to end this era of absentee leadership in the Oval Office and send real leaders to the White House.</title></item><item><title>America needs Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan and we need them right now. There is doubt and fear for our future in every corner of our country. These feelings are real. This moment is real. It's a moment like this where some skeptics wonder if American greatness is over. How those who have come before us had the spirit and tenacity to lead America to a new era of greatness in the face of challenge. Not to look around and say "not me," but to say, "YES, ME." I have an answer tonight for the skeptics and the naysayers, the dividers and the defenders of the status quo. I have faith in us. I know we can be the men and women our country calls on us to be. I believe in America and her history. There's only one thing missing now. Leadership. It takes leadership that you don't get from reading a poll. You see, Mr. President ­ real leaders don't follow polls. Real leaders change polls. That's what we need to do now. Change polls through the power of our principles. Change polls through the strength of our convictions. Tonight, our duty is to tell the American people the truth. Our problems are big and the solutions will not be painless. We all must share in the sacrifice. Any leader that tells us differently is simply not telling the truth. I think tonight of the Greatest Generation. We look back and marvel at their courage ­ overcoming the Great Depression, fighting Nazi tyranny, standing up for freedom around the world. Now it's our time to answer history's call. For make no mistake, every generation will be judged and so will we. What will our children and grandchildren say of us? Will they say we buried our heads in the sand, we assuaged ourselves with the creature comforts we've acquired, that our problems were too big and we were too small, that someone else should make a difference because we can't? Or will they say we stood up and made the tough choices needed to preserve our way of life?</title></item><item><title>I don't know about you, but I don't want my children and grandchildren to have to read in a history book what it was like to live in an American Century. I don't want their only inheritance to be an enormous government that has overtaxed, overspent and over-borrowed a great people into second-class citizenship. I want them to live in a second American Century. A second American Century of strong economic growth where those who are willing to work hard will have good paying jobs to support their families and reach their dreams. A second American Century where real American exceptionalism is not a political punch line, but is evident to everyone in the world just by watching the way our government conducts its business and everyday Americans live their lives. A second American Century where our military is strong, our values are sure, our work ethic is unmatched and our Constitution remains a model for anyone in the world struggling for liberty. Let us choose a path that will be remembered for generations to come. Standing strong for freedom will make the next century as great an American century as the last one. This is the American way. We have never been victims of destiny. We have always been masters of our own. I won't be part of the generation that fails that test and neither will you. It's now time to stand up. There's no time left to waste. If you're willing to stand up with me for America's future, I will stand up with you. If you're willing to fight with me for Mitt Romney, I will fight with you. If you're willing to hear the truth about the hard road ahead, and the rewards for America that truth will bear, I'm here to begin with you this new era of truth-telling. Tonight, we choose the path that has always defined our nation's history. Tonight, we finally and firmly answer the call that so many generations have had the courage to answer before us. Tonight, we stand up for Mitt Romney as the next President of the United States. And, together, we stand up once again for American greatness. </title></item></channel></rss>

I am honored to be with you today. In these few months leading up to the election, all eyes are on rallying Republicans here at home. But Republicans living and working abroad also play a critical role in electing and supporting our candidates--through voting and fundraising. As global chair of Republicans Abroad, I live in Singapore and work with chapters in over 50 countries around the world. Our job is to encourage American citizens to register and vote Republican. With over six million Americans living overseas, it is often a challenge to convince overseas voters that their vote matters. But consider the 2000 election; it was the overseas voters from right here in Florida that determined the outcome of that election. And Senator Connie Mack often credits the success of his first election to Republicans abroad. So, please remind your friends and family living abroad that their civic duty does not end at the water's edge. Their vote matters and every vote counts--those cast here or abroad. So, Republicans here and abroad let's come together to elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.</title></item><item><title>Thank you and God bless. </title></item></channel></rss>

My story is like many from Northern Michigan. I grew up in a little town called Iron River. My family didn't have much when I was growing up and we lost my dad when I was young. But I worked hard, saved money, and was able to become a doctor and raise my family in Northern Michigan. That was my American Dream. Along the way, it never occurred to me to get into politics, let alone run for Congress. But I did, two years ago. Because, like many of you, I was disgusted by what was going on in Washington. They are spending away our children's and grandchildren's futures. Today, the American Dream is being threatened. I know our nation is facing enormous challenges. Unemployment is far too high. We have a nearly $16 trillion debt. It's hard for Michigan families to make ends meet. But I believe we can fix these problems by staying true to what has always made this country great: individual liberty, free enterprise, and limited government. People from Northern Michigan are tough. We don't give up when times are hard. Like you, we will keep working to protect the American Dream, and to ensure our best days are yet to come. So we need you to keep the American Dream alive and deliver this election for America.</title></item><item><title>Thank you and may God bless you all. </title></item></channel></rss>

You can feel it: Our country is at a crossroads. This election will determine whether we continue on the path of more spending, more debt and economic disaster - or whether we choose real solutions and return to the basic principles of free enterprise and limited government. At this critical hour in our nation's history, we can't afford to re-elect Barack Obama - a man who believes that America is the problem. We can't afford to re-elect a man who doesn't understand that it was the hard work and achievement of the American people that made this country great. We can't afford to re-elect someone who believes that our dismal economy is doing just fine! And in North Carolina's 7th Congressional district, we can't afford to re-elect Mike McIntyre ­ a man who voted four times to make Nancy Pelosi the Speaker, and then voted with her more than 90 percent of the time - 90 percent of the time - while she controlled the House. We can't afford to re-elect a man like Mike McIntyre who said about Obama's failed stimulus, "in our part of the country ­ it has worked." Ladies and gentlemen, let's send Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and their lieutenant Mike McIntyre home and restore America to greatness! Elect Romney-Ryan and Rouzer on November 6!</title></item><item><title>May God bless you and may God bless America. </title></item></channel></rss>
Deb Fischer,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Deb Fischer</title><description>Remarks of Deb Fischer to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Thank you. I'm not your typical politician. I'm a wife. I'm a mother of three grown sons, a rancher, a small business owner and a citizen-legislator. Becoming a U.S. Senator has never been an ambition of mine. But over the last four years, I've become dismayed with the record spending, the record debt, and the record unemployment. The Obama administration has been out of touch with the American people, and they've driven our country towards the edge of a fiscal cliff. We're on track to become the first generation that passes on fewer opportunities to the next. And that is unacceptable. But it doesn't have to be this way. I'm running for the U.S. Senate because I know we can do better. I've been a Senator in the Nebraska legislature these past eight years. And in Nebraska, we have an unemployment rate of only 4 percent. How did we get there? We cut spending. We balance our budget every year. We passed the biggest tax relief package in the history of our state. And most importantly, we got government out of the way and let the private sector do what it does best: grow our economy and create jobs.</title></item><item><title>We've done it in Nebraska, and I know we can do the same thing in Washington, because we only have two options left. We can either continue the same failed policies of the past, or we can begin to make the tough decisions and lead our country responsibly. We have a tremendous opportunity to set our country in a new, more prosperous direction, and it begins in November. Thank you so much, and may God Bless America. </title></item></channel></rss>

I represent the 23rd Congressional District of Texas. Mitt Romney and I share a simple belief. We owe our children a better future. We owe them a future without high unemployment, higher taxes and a crushing burden of debt. Along the nearly 800 miles of US-Mexico border that I serve, farmers, small businesses and families are striving to live the American dream. Whether you are a seventh generation American or a first generation immigrant, like my parents were, coming to seek a better life, we all want the opportunity to succeed. Unfortunately, Barack Obama is burdening us with destructive debt, punishing taxes, and robbing us of that opportunity to succeed. We can ensure our children have a brighter future if we follow this guidance. Un gobierno limitado y menos impuestos significan más oportunidad y mejores empleos para un futuro más próspero para las siguientes generaciones. Con Mitt Romney como Presidente - lo podemos hacer mejor. The answer is simple. Lower taxes and less government means more opportunity and better job creation for a brighter future for generations to come.</title></item><item><title>We can do better with Mitt Romney as President.

I'm glad to have you as a champion of small business for New Hampshire. Like many small businessmen, my dad borrowed against our house to purchase the machinery to start Gilchrist Metal Fabricating. Machines making equipment for drilling oil, generating power, broadcasting television, processing food and many other industries. Machines run by taxpaying Americans. We employ about 40 people, most of them with families, including my son Stuart. Though we have enjoyed success, we face more global pressure every day. So do our suppliers and customers. If we don't continually improve and streamline our processes to stay efficient, we will lose out to our competition. We don't have a choice. Often the decisions we make are difficult. Running a business means taking responsibility:    Presenting a certain future to the management team. Developing a functional budget. Insuring that we have adequate supplies.</title></item><item><title>Making a commitment to fulfill our customer's orders on time.</title></item><item><title>Sure, there are things which I cannot control. But running the business is my job and mine alone. I blame no one else for the challenges we face. I am often reminded of something Lee Iacocca said: "lead, follow or get out of the way." Everyone who runs a business understands this. Everyone but our federal government. They won't lead. Their rules and regulations are too hard to follow. And they won't get out of our way. This Administration is killing us out here. Small business needs a leader. A leader who understands the entire spectrum of business and industry. A leader who can work with all parties involved. A leader who will not avoid dealing with difficult issues. A leader with the experience to understand what it takes. A leader who is in touch with America's small businesses. Mitt Romney is exactly that leader. Thank you!</title></item><item><title></title></item></channel></rss>

I'm proud to represent Indiana, which we affectionately refer to as the Hoosier State. Hoosiers cherish values like common sense, hard work and problem solving. And there's a lot Washington can learn from the Hoosier state. When Indiana faced a massive budget shortfall, we didn't play partisan games. We came together, rolled up our sleeves and turned a billion-dollar deficit into a surplus. We understood that when you have a deficit, spending more money isn't the solution. In the face of record unemployment, we understood that more government spending won't create jobs. That's why we passed common-sense reforms that made it easier to do business ­ and create jobs -- in our great state. As a result, Indiana was rated as the best Midwest state to do business in and we are among the nation's leaders in job growth. In the Hoosier state, we proved a very simple lesson: Working together is the best way to solve our problems. And Washington can do the same. By cutting spending and reducing the red tape, we can unleash our small businesses to create jobs. And with Hoosier common sense, we can balance the budget and get our nation's economy working again. American workers and American entrepreneurs are the best in the world.</title></item><item><title>I'm ready to carry their torch to Washington and prove there will never be a mountain too high for us to climb. The American spirit will always persevere. Fellow Hoosiers it's your time to take back our country. Thank you and God bless! </title></item></channel></rss>
Janine Turner,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Janine Turner</title><description>Remarks of Janine Turner to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Hello fellow patriots! As an actress, I have worked on movie sets all across our great land, from New York to Los Angeles, from Miami to Seattle. As a constitutionalist, I have traversed America, visiting classrooms and town halls, from Ohio to Arizona, from Colorado to Wisconsin. What I have witnessed is the splendor of American ingenuity, the triumph of American tenacity and the goodness of the American heart. And President Obama, I'm here to tell ya, the government didn't build it. God and the American people built it! And while we are at it, I stand here as witness ­ America is exceptional. America's entrepreneurship was fostered by our Founding Fathers' vision of a Republic ­ a small government, limited by the Constitution's enumerated powers. Speaking of our republic, when Benjamin Franklin was walking out of Independence Hall after signing the Constitution, a woman approached him and said, "Sir, what form of government have you given us?" Franklin replied, "A republic, ma'am, if you can keep it!" I believe the best way to keep it ­ our republican form of government ­ is with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan!</title></item><item><title>Our Constitution guarantees us a republican form of government in Article 4 Section 4. But our liberal brethren don't feel constrained by our Constitution. That's convenient for them. By ignoring Constitutional limits, they do whatever they like ­ grow the government to unbelievable and unsustainable heights, and accumulate historic, catastrophic debt. Patrick Henry said, "Give me liberty or give me death." Today Obama enables an entitlement society that says, "Give me liberty and gimme, gimme!" Why? Because democrats depend on dependence. America was not born with a gimme, gimme mentality, and American liberty cannot survive with a gimme, gimme mentality. America was built with her hands at work, not with her hands out. The torch of the American dream is fueled with the unquenchable desire for independence, liberty and freedom. Free enterprise has paved the way for Americans to earn their own success and it has created an America that has yielded an unprecedented level of progress. This progress has lifted up humanity to greater heights of living and a greater level of dignity. Mitt Romney will preserve this exceptional American legacy. Barack Obama will destroy it. Obama is stifling the American dream primarily because it isn't HIS dream. His dream is not of an independent people. His dream is of a dependent people based upon the failed principles of antiquated governments. Mitt Romney will restore the American dream based on three of our tried and true founding principles. 1) God gives us our rights, not government. If man gives us our rights, then man can take them away. As James Madison forewarned, and history has proven, "men are not angels."</title></item><item><title>2) The checks and balances of government are paramount: without them, we have tyranny, and tyranny strangles liberty. 3) The genius of the people will prevail: for the people's voice is the republic, and for the republic Mitt Romney will stand. Thank you! </title></item></channel></rss>

If you spent $1 million every day, it would take you almost 3,000 years to get to $1 trillion. We are now nearly $16 trillion in debt. Each day we pay more than $600 million in interest on that debt - and we deficit spend $3 billion a day. Excessive regulations choke businesses. Our tax code punishes success, discourages entrepreneurs, and stifles growth. President Obama's solution: more government and more taxes. This isn't the American Dream. Our nation isn't just one good tax increase away from prosperity. American success hasn't come from Czars, "Cash for Clunkers," endless bailouts, a limitless government credit card, or more taxes for more government. The American Dream was built on the sweat and blood of Americans who took pride and personal ownership in themselves and their country. When times were tough, generations before quietly rolled up their sleeves and built a stronger, more prosperous nation. The government didn't build it. They built it. America was built with hard work, dedication to principles, and a belief that success was predicated on liberty and ownership. Restoring the American Dream will require fiscal discipline, limited government, accountability, and a strong national defense. We need to make tough choices. We need leadership. We need to elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.</title></item><item><title>We need to believe in America again. Thank you. </title></item></channel></rss>
John Boehner,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>John Boehner</title><description>Remarks of John Boehner to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Delegates and alternates, ladies and gentlemen, the convention will be in order. We begin tonight with a fundamental question: Can we do better? The answer, in my view, is obvious: You bet we can. The American people are still asking "where are the jobs," but President Obama only offers excuses instead of answers. His record is a shadow of his rhetoric. Yet he has the nerve to say that he's moving us forward, and the audacity to hope that we'll believe him. Allow me to illustrate. I'm what you'd call a regular guy with a big job. I've got 11 brothers and sisters. My dad and my uncles owned a bar outside of Cincinnati. I worked there growing up, mopping floors, waiting tables. Believe me when I say I learned how to deal with every character who walked in the door. So let's say right now, a guy walked into our bar ­ full of guys looking for work, having a tough go of it ­ and said, "THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS DOING FINE." Well, do you know what we'd do? That's right: We'd throw him out. If a guy walked into our bar ­ full of people paying more for health care, more for gas, more for everything ­ and said, "WE'RE BETTER OFF THAN WE WOULD HAVE BEEN." Do you know what we'd do? Throw him out.</title></item><item><title>If a guy walked into our bar ­ full of folks who couldn't tell you the last time they got a raise or their house was above water ­ and said, "WE TRIED OUR ECONOMIC PLAN ­ AND IT WORKED." Do you know what we'd do? Throw him out. Now let's say a guy walked into our bar and before he could say anything he overheard a regular telling his story. Turns out this man runs a small business. Got involved with it while he was still working his way through school. Then, out of nowhere, his business partner died. They had just one customer at the time. So he fought like hell, through sleepless nights and close calls. They made it, thank God, paid their dues, proud of what they managed to do. Now if a guy walked into our bar, heard all that, and said, "IF YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS, YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT." You know what we'd do. Throw him out. By the way, that small business guy at the bar: That was my story. That was our business. We did build that. It could just as easily have been the story of anyone who's built something from nothing. No guarantees. No government there to hold your hand. Just a dream and the desire to do better. President Obama just doesn't get this. He can't fix the economy because he doesn't know how it was built. So in 70 days when the American people walk into the voting booth, what should we do? Throw him out. Because we can do better. We can do a lot better. It starts with throwing out the politician who doesn't get it, and electing a new president who does. Mitt Romney comes from a family of builders. His father built houses, built businesses, built industry. George Romney was a can-do kind of guy. He was fond of the old saying that when things are at their worst, "that's just the place and time that the tide will turn." Delegates, this is that time and this is that place. We're here to preserve this country the same way we built it: by exercising our God-given right to set a new course. Who better to turn this tide than a man who has dedicated his career to doing just that ­ for states, for businesses, for the Olympic Games. President Romney ­ boy, I like the sound of that ­ President Romney will keep his word and his courage, too. He'll keep faith with the idea that government exists to serve the people, and the people build the economy. Mitt's jobs plan will build a stronger middle class through energy independence; schools where our kids ­ not the teachers unions ­ come first; free trade, the path to a balanced budget; and an end to the uncertainty ­ and the tax hikes ­ that threaten small businesses.</title></item><item><title>It's a big job, so we're fortunate that Mitt has chosen as his running mate a leader who is second to none when it comes to rooting out and fixing Washington's worst habits. When I met Paul Ryan 22 years ago, he was a student at Miami of Ohio volunteering on my campaign. Soon, he will be our party's nominee for vice president of the United States. Who says this isn't the greatest country on Earth? They call this "America's comeback team." Well, any good comeback needs some true believers. So if you believe we can do better, if you want to leave our children a stronger, more prosperous America, then Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan need your help. Because we can turn this tide, but only if all of us are all in, all the way to the 6th of November. It starts here with a convention that will lead to victory for our party ­ and more importantly, victory for our people and the great cause of freedom.</title></item><item><title></title></item></channel></rss>
John Hoeven,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>John Hoeven</title><description>Remarks of John Hoeven to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Fellow delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen: We Republicans believe in this great country, and we believe in the American people. We know that our people are our greatest natural resource. Our plan to build a brighter future for our country is built on the strength of the American people ­ on their vision, their work ethic, and their deep desire for a brighter future. At the heart of it is job creation, because job creation must be job number one for our country at this critical point in our history. What Americans want today is what America has always offered in abundance: opportunity. And opportunity begins with a good job. A decade ago, we in North Dakota worked to forge a pro-growth, pro-business agenda that encouraged private-sector investment and innovation in all of our key industries, including energy. We built a strong, competitive environment where businesses could grow ­ and hire ­ without red tape or high taxes. The result was jobs and a thriving economy. Today, North Dakota has the lowest unemployment rate and the fastest growing economy in the nation. Instead of discouraging businesses with bureaucracy, we helped them to do things right, with good environmental stewardship. But the Obama Administration doesn't see it that way, and the Keystone XL pipeline is a good example. This $7 billion, high-tech project would not only reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil, but also help hold down the cost of fuel at the pump and create thousands of American jobs.</title></item><item><title>After four years of environmental review, however, the administration just says no ­ no to jobs, no to economic growth, no to lower fuel prices for consumers. That's not what the American people want. What they want is reliable and affordable energy to power their homes, run their businesses, and fuel their cars. They want jobs and real opportunity to build a good life ­ and to leave that same legacy to their children. We can provide that opportunity and get our nation's economy back on track again ­ if we focus on the things that actually encourage job growth and economic opportunity for the American people. They know that our country is at a crossroads of history. They also need to know that we offer a brighter alternative for our country's future. Thank you and God bless the United States of America. It is now my pleasure to introduce my fellow co-chair, Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. </title></item></channel></rss>

Our economy is stagnant. Our vitality has been sapped. Our confidence is down. We are saddled with a failed presidency, with an incumbent president who has not led. America needs real change, and we are here to affirm a leader who will produce that change. There are many reasons America needs Mitt Romney at the helm. We have 23 million Americans unemployed or underemployed because Barack Obama cannot figure out what makes free enterprise work. Mitt Romney will get our private sector moving again, and will respect the successes of our entrepreneurs who deserve credit because they really did build it. In these difficult times our nation still depends on others for our energy resources ­ even though we share the largest overall supplies of energy in the world ­ because we have an administration that shuns those assets and keeps us dependent on fragile foreign supplies. Mitt Romney will unshackle our assets, and lead us to real energy independence.</title></item><item><title>We also are a nation that has seen erosion of our respect around the world because we have a president who prefers to lead from behind. Mitt Romney will restore our strength, support our friends, face up to our foes and regain honest respect for an America willing to lead. My wife Nancy and I have gotten to know Mitt and Ann Romney well. We have developed a deep and sincere appreciation for these two friends and their family ­ we like them and we respect them. Tonight we all gather here to put in motion the final phase of our campaign to help America know them better, and to appreciate why our nation needs them as our president and first lady. Mitt Romney is a good man, and a smart man. He is compassionate and generous. He is a great father and a supportive friend. He has been a very successful businessman and a very effective governor. He knows how to fix the unfixable, and to help people perform to their highest potential. Mitt Romney is the right man at the right time and will be a great leader for our country. It is my honor to nominate Mitt Romney for the Office of President of the United States of America. </title></item></channel></rss>

We've heard, and will continue to hear, a great deal about health care and Medicare in this election -- and that's a good thing. As a cancer survivor, no issue is more personal to me than health care and the strength of our doctor-patient relationships. Having developed and survived a very rare form of cancer that kills 75 percent of its victims within five years, I know all too well the importance of a health care system that empowers the doctor-patient relationship and respects the decisions of the family. There is no greater threat to the health care of our nation and the health care of our seniors than Obamacare. No matter what path we take to save Medicare, the very first step is to repeal Obamacare. My district, Pennsylvania-12, has one of the largest Medicare populations in the entire country. My opponent, Congressman Critz, voted over 20 times to support Obamacare, including voting against repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which empowers not doctors and patients, but bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. There is only one ticket that will defend patients, defend doctors and defend families in this health care battle. There is only one ticket that will save Medicare from bankruptcy, preserve Medicare for today's seniors and strengthen Medicare for the future.</title></item><item><title>To repeal, to replace, to restore ­ choose Romney, Ryan and Rothfus.

That's the motto of the great state of New Hampshire. But I believe tonight we all share that view ­ as have generations of Americans before us. Like most Americans ­ our family's life changed after 9/11. My husband Joe ­ who was on track to be a commercial pilot ­ instead served our great country flying combat missions in Iraq. When he returned home from the war ­ he found himself in the same position as so many Americans ­ he needed a job. So he started a family business ­ a landscaping and snowplowing company. And when I say he ­ I mean we ­ because I spent many a sleepless night shoveling snow. And I'm proud of the fact that in addition to being a United States Senator ­ I'm also pretty good with a snow plow! We are no different from most families who take risks starting their own business. We borrowed money to pursue our dreams. And believe me, there was no guarantee of success. We certainly were not too big to fail ­ we had to make it work. Yet through all the hard work and sacrifice ­ we pulled together as a family. As the business grew so did our extended family. And I speak to you tonight with great concern ­ for our employees ­ their families ­ my family ­ and your family. My concern is that President Obama is making it very difficult for small businesses to get started ­ to create jobs ­ and to survive. I hear this all the time from the small business owners I speak with.</title></item><item><title>They want to focus on their business. The Obama Administration wants to bury them with rules, regulations and red tape. From the National Labor Relations Board ­ to the Department of Labor ­ to the EPA. Under this Administration, the regulations are up ­ and the job creation is down. President Obama's view is clear: he actually believes that as a family business grows ­ the federal government should take a larger share of its earnings. That's punishment for expanding and creating more jobs. I call it a "success tax." And the very best example is Obamacare. Let me tell you what I hear in the real world about Obamacare. Just a couple of months ago ­ a successful restaurant owner in Concord, New Hampshire, told me about his dilemma. He wanted to open up a second restaurant ­ and hire more employees. But he realized that if he did ­ he would trigger penalties under Obamacare and he couldn't afford it. So he never opened up that restaurant. Is that what we want for small businesses in America ­ to be afraid to grow because of the government? To face penalties when you create more jobs? To be told "you're earning too much"? Isn't it time we had a leader who believes that creating jobs ought to be celebrated not penalized? That is why Mitt Romney is running for president. He'll get the federal government out of the business of small business. He'll fight to lower and simplify taxes. He'll work to eliminate job-killing red tape. And he will roll back Obamacare starting on Day One! In both the private sector and as Governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney always asked: how can I help small businesses grow, innovate, and compete? It's the right question. And it's the question that this Administration never thinks to ask. But why should we be surprised? President Obama has never even run a lemonade stand ­ and it shows. So what we need to do is clear.</title></item><item><title>For the sake of the future of small business ­ we need to replace Barack Obama. We need to replace Barack Obama with Mitt Romney. A man who truly gets it. Mitt understands the hopes and dreams of small business owners throughout our great country. But don't just take my word for it. I want you to hear directly from someone on the front lines of small business. Jack Gilchrist is a small business owner from Hudson, New Hampshire. Three generations of his family have used their own hands to build Gilchrist Metal Fabricating. It's a true family business ­ founded over 30 years ago by Jack's father ­ and carried on by Jack and his son. Jack Gilchrist is the face of small business in America, and yes he did build it.

And times are bad under Barack Obama and his leadership. The labor force participation is at its lowest level in 30 years. Twenty-three million Americans are unemployed, underemployed, or have stopped looking for work. And quite simply, the jobs just aren't there. Household incomes have fallen and their debt has risen. We're paying more for healthcare and getting less choice. There's a war on young people, a war on paychecks and a war on our ability to succeed. We're working to build our own businesses, struggling to pave our own way, only to learn that, according to this president, we didn't build it. But there is hope -- for the change of a new day.

My name is Lucé, and it's great to be here with you tonight! I am the proud mother of 20-year-old triplets, a practicing attorney, a proud Latina, and a die-hard Republican! I am also the wife of someone we're extremely proud of back home in Puerto Rico: Luis Fortuño. As Governor, he has unleashed a true Republican revolution that has already accomplished so much. It is a success story of fiscal responsibility, controlled government spending, lower taxes, and pro-growth policies. But it is also one of caring and compassionate attention to a social and faith-based agenda of unprecedented reach and consequence. Through it all, I have stood by his side and learned what it takes to be the rock of support to a great leader, just like our next speaker has done for 43 years for our next President, Mitt Romney! Ann's story is one of remarkable courage, tenacity, and commitment: a story that stands in its own right, one that inspires all who know her. A woman of faith, a devoted wife, a caring mother to five boys, a multiple sclerosis and cancer survivor, a tireless advocate, and a timeless First Lady of Massachusetts. For decades, she's been a fighter who has championed the cause of disadvantaged children, been an advocate of teenage pregnancy prevention, a leader of faith and community-based initiatives, and an ambassador for multiple sclerosis awareness.</title></item><item><title>Watching her, during a recent visit to Puerto Rico, I marveled at her ability to endear children, connect with the elderly, and engage workers at a farmers market with such ease, heart, and purpose that people wondered "who was the handsome gentleman next to her?"

Buenas noches Puerto Rico! Buenas noches America! As a proud American serving the nearly 4 million American citizens of Puerto Rico, I am honored to be with you tonight. We gather to celebrate the hopes and dreams of every American. We all believe in the greatness of this nation, and this greatness lies within each of us. Hard-working Americans are fighting every day to provide for themselves and their families, and to leave a more prosperous country for the next generation. That's true here in Florida, it's true in Puerto Rico, and it's true throughout this great land of ours. But, as families have tightened their budgets, Washington continues its wasteful spending. Unless we elect leaders who take responsibility now, our children and theirs will pay for it later. You and I know there is a better way, and like many conservative governors around the country, we are proving it. When I took office, I inherited a $3.3 billion budget deficit, per person the largest anywhere in the nation. We couldn't even meet our payroll. We were on the brink of bankruptcy. But we did not shy away from our responsibility to lead.</title></item><item><title>We cut government expenses by almost 20 percent, starting with my own salary. We reduced our deficit 90 percent, while continuing to invest in our schools, hospitals, and highways. At the same time, we slashed taxes 50 percent on individuals and 30 percent on businesses, the largest tax cuts in Puerto Rico's history. And our private sector ­ the real economy ­ began to create jobs again. Imagine if we had national policies that support rather than prevent growth! We'd then be able to truly unleash the engine of prosperity that our country and our people deserve. That's what Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will do for America. They understand that each community's challenges are unique, but the answers are the same. Our families cannot grow their budgets if politicians keep growing Washington's budget. Get government out of our way, and let freedom and the spirit of the American people shine through. We can out-think, out-dream, out-work, and out-produce anybody in the world. I know it, you know it, and Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan know it. They have a plan and a vision that places our faith in you, the American people, not in Washington. Ask any small-business owner in America today -- from the dairy farmer in Appleton, Wisconsin, to the bodega owner in Kissimmee, Florida: they want to grow, to produce and to hire. But they're concerned, worried that Washington will continue to punish them with more taxes, more red tape, and more government control. Give them the freedom to grow, and you'll see how many jobs they create! I like to talk a lot about freedom, because freedom is the essence of who we are as Americans. Over 200,000 Puerto Ricans have served in uniform to defend our nation and the freedom we hold so dear. Like in your home states, we raise and salute the American flag. Just like our fellow citizens in Florida or Virginia, we share the same undying spirit that all Americans have.</title></item><item><title>Allow me to share an example of that spirit. I visited a soldier from Puerto Rico at Walter Reed Army Medical Center several years ago. This young man had bravely served in combat and was given little chance to live. Without knowing if he could hear me, in every visit, I would whisper into his ear. I would tell him how proud and thankful we were for his dedication and sacrifice, adding, no te rindas: don't give up. Months later, after his miraculous recovery, I had the honor of awarding him the Purple Heart. He never gave up. For him, and for every American in uniform, we will never give up. For every mother who struggles, saves, and sacrifices so her children will have greater opportunities, we will never give up. For every small-business owner who builds it to make a better life, we will never give up. For Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, who know what it takes to put America back to work and back on track, we will never give up. And for the values that make America great: the justice that is our right, the freedom to unleash the greatness within each of us, and the liberty that God endowed every American. For that, I will never give up, you will never give up, we will never give up! God Bless you, and God bless the United States of America!

We are at a crossroads; we have a choice to make. We have a President who wants his party to make us all dependent on government.

We have a President who tramples our first amendment right to religious liberty by requiring all taxpayers to fund abortions. We need public servants who respect life and our religious freedom. We have a President all-too-willing to lead from behind. We need a White House that will unflinchingly support our strongest ally, Israel. We need a President who believes in America. We have a nation too precious to give up on. We have a history too glorious to be forgotten. We have a Constitution too noble to be rewritten. We have a God who reigns over the affairs of nations. And we have a people who, once again, are ready to stand up as "We the People" and choose for themselves the direction of their beloved country. I'm Mark Meadows and I'm running for Congress. With Mitt Romney, we're ready to take our country back.</title></item><item><title></title></item></channel></rss>

It's also been a lot of work ­ and a lot of fun. You can be so proud of the members of your state delegations. They were smart, conscientious, and opinionated in the best way. They knew what they and you believed, and weren't afraid to say so. And neither were the thousands of American people who responded to our call and through social media offered us their solutions to the challenges that face our country. It has been a remarkable exercise in grassroots democracy and, from this day forward, the GOP will be known as the Great Opportunity Party. If you want to know how our economy can create the millions of jobs we need in order to get America back to work; If you want to know how we're going to get the unlimited energy we need to power our economy so that this really will be an American century; If you're alarmed by our country's declining position in the world, and wondering what can be done to reverse it; Read this platform. Read it to learn how, together, we can assure a quality education for every child, regardless of where they live or what their family income might be.</title></item><item><title>Read it to discover how the American people can replace Obamacare with patient-centered, quality healthcare. Read it to learn about the Republican Party's commitment to true federalism -- where the states take the lead in providing smaller, smarter and more efficient government. If you want to know how Republicans ­ Republicans like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan ­ are going to get America back on track, and back into the black, go online and read this platform. And you will find that where we stand is right with you, with every American who wants a better future for their children, a more secure future for the elderly and a renewed promise of the American dream.

Mary Fallin,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Mary Fallin</title><description>Remarks of Mary Fallin to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Thank you. President Ronald Reagan once said "there are no great limits to growth, because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder." He believed, like I believe ­ like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan believe ­ that the potential for America is limitless. We can ­ and we will ­ overcome any economic challenge if government lets go of the regulatory chokehold zapping the air out of the economy and deflating the spirits of our entrepreneurs. We need a president who will applaud and encourage those who work hard to pursue their dreams, to reach their potential, and, in doing so, make themselves and America better and stronger. That man is Mitt Romney. The history of my state of Oklahoma offers a great example of pursuing the American Dream. It was built and settled by pioneers moving West to seek better lives. During the great Land Run of 1889, thousands of families rushed to put a stake down on empty plots of land. They built tent cities overnight, they farmed the land, and they worked hard. And in 1897, eight years after the Land Run, a handful of adventurous pioneers risked their own money ­ not, the federal government's money ­ to drill Oklahoma's first oil well, the Nellie Johnstone. By doing so, these early-day pioneers changed the future and the fortune of Oklahoma forever, and today Oklahoma is one of the nation's key energy producers and job creators.</title></item><item><title>President Obama wants us to believe that Oklahomans owe that success to the federal government: to the Department of Energy, to the EPA, the IRS or maybe even to him. Mr. President, we know better. As we say in Oklahoma, that dog won't hunt. We owe these remarkable successes to the imagination and ingenuity of people like my friend, Oklahoman Harold Hamm. The son of sharecroppers, and the youngest of 13 children, Harold grew up in the small town of Lexington, Oklahoma. As a child, he helped out on the farm and went to school only after the first freeze or Christmas. While attending high school, he worked for a dollar-an-hour at a gas station. After high school, Harold took a job cleaning out oil barrels. At the age of 20, he bought his own truck and began a one-man, oil-field-service business. He made enough money to begin taking college-level classes in geology and mineralogy. At 26 years old, he drilled a wildcat well that produced 75 barrels of oil an hour. We call that a gusher. Today, Harold Hamm is the Chairman and CEO of Oklahoma's own Continental Resources, a top ten U.S. producer of petroleum liquids with nearly 700 employees, operating in 10 states, and valued at over $13 Billion. Now Harold and his company are helping to power cars, homes, and businesses across the nation. Harold and other energy entrepreneurs have completely transformed the U.S.'s energy outlook. And with a President Romney, we'll end America's dependence on foreign oil. And create even more American jobs. Harold's success story is not one-of-a-kind; it is an American dream that has been realized by countless men and women since the founding of this country. He is just one of the many visionaries and innovators in the private sector that are the true drivers of economic growth and job creation. And that's what President Obama just doesn't get.</title></item><item><title>He'll tell you that "If you've got a business ­ you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen." Well, Mr. President ­ like who? The IRS? The EPA? Or the federal government? The president believes that government is responsible for our successes and that's why his solution to everything is more government, bigger spending, more regulation, and more bureaucratic programs like Obamacare. He says his plans are working, but look at the results:     42 straight months of unemployment over 8% 23 Million Americans out of work, underemployed, or no longer even looking for work A nation threatened by nearly $16 trillion dollars of debt Families feeling pinched, not just by a bad economy, but by a President who promised hope and change, and left many Americans with no hope and just change in their pockets</title></item><item><title>President Obama believes the power of a Big Government is the key to American success. Mitt Romney believes in the power of the people. Mitt Romney understands that free enterprise and hard work ­ not government ­ have made the United States the envy of the world. He will reverse the tide of decline and promote economic security. He knows it's hard-working American families, not federal bureaucracy, that have built our great and glorious nation. Mitt Romney is ready to lead. He has the experience and the vision we need to restore America's economy and its greatness. I am proud to support his candidacy for president, and as the next leader of the Free World; he will make us proud. Thank you. </title></item></channel></rss>

The choice is clear: the status quo of the entitlement society, or dynamic change to an opportunity society. We need a President who will say to a small businesswoman: congratulations, we applaud your success, you did make that happen, you did build that! Big government didn't build America: You built America! Small businesses don't come out of Washington D.C. pre-made on flat bed trucks. That coffee shop in Henrico; that florist in Virginia Beach....that bakery in Radford...they were all built by entrepreneurial Americans with big dreams....not a big spending government with a wide open wallet full of other people's money!" ... "Conservative fiscal policies are working, and so are more Americans in states with Republican governors. Now, just think what we can do if we had a President who would support us, not obstruct us. Someone who has created jobs in the private sector, who understands the economy, and who has actually balanced a budget....or heck, for that matter, who has actually passed a budget!</title></item><item><title>We need President Mitt Romney!

As a 24 year old Virginian in Iraq, I worked with some of the most courageous men and women this nation has to offer, and we were united in a singular cause: to protect the nation that we love. It has been my privilege to serve alongside heroes of every service. Defending this nation and its citizens is not without sacrifice for service members and the families who support them. And that's why we need leaders who don't play chicken with our nation's defense. We need leaders who will invest in defense--not abandon it. And that's why we need Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Now, it is my honor to introduce Chris Devlin-Young, a hero in his own right, a former Coast Guardsman and a two-time Paralympic gold medalist in alpine skiing. Chris. Chris Devlin-Young: Thank you. It's wonderful to be with you tonight.</title></item><item><title>In 1982, while flying in heavy fog during a Coast Guard mission, our plane crashed, leaving me paralyzed from the waist down. While my career as a Coast Guardsman ended, a new world of service began for me. 27 years ago, this California boy was introduced to ski racing at the first Veterans Administration Winter Sports clinic. I decided then and there to dedicate myself to racing and coaching other injured veterans. Being a gold medal Paralympian gives me a whole new way to honor and serve my country. Being the coach of paralympic medalists gives me a way to honor and serve others. I believe that we can all serve no matter what our challenges. Because it's not about what you've lost in life but rather what you are able to give. And now, it is my honor to introduce a hero who has given of himself regardless of the price. He is the son and grandson of admirals, a decorated naval pilot, a war hero, and the senior senator from the great state of Arizona -- Senator John McCain. </title></item></channel></rss>

My parents immigrated to the U.S. with ten dollars in their pocket, believing that the America they had heard about really did exist. When times got tough they didn't look to Washington, they looked within. So the America I came to know was centered in personal responsibility and filled with the American dream. The America I know is grounded in the determination found in patriots and pioneers, in small business owners with big ideas, in the farmers who work in the beauty of our landscape, in our heroic military and Olympians. It's in every child who looks at the seemingly impossible and says, "I can do that." That is the America I know! President Obama's version of America is a divided one -- pitting us against each other based on our income level, gender, and social status. His policies have failed! We are not better off than we were 4 years ago, and no rhetoric, bumper sticker, or campaign ad can change that. Mr. President I am here to tell you we are not buying what you are selling in 2012. The American Dream is our story. It is a story of human struggle, standing up and striving for more. It's been told for over 200 years with small steps and giant leaps; from a woman on a bus to a man with a dream; and the bravery of the greatest generation, to the entrepreneurs of today. This is our story. This is the America we know because we built it. With Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan we can restore the America we know and love. The world will know it, our children will tell it and our grandchildren will possess it for years to come! God bless America. </title></item></channel></rss>

In Oklahoma, we think we've made a very real and substantial contribution to this presidential ticket. Janna Ryan, the smart and charming wife of the next Vice President of the United States, is from Oklahoma, and Paul and Janna were married in Oklahoma City. It's becoming more and more unusual for our best and brightest to leave the state, but in this case we're glad it's worked out the way it has. We're enjoying a renaissance in Oklahoma City. It's a renaissance fueled by sound, fiscally conservative leadership and a belief that local investment in infrastructure is vital to economic development. Twenty years ago we decided "we can do better" and we have. Today, we have the nation's lowest unemployment rate among large U.S. metropolitan areas. While there is a role for Washington in addressing our city's critical infrastructure needs ­ we chose to invest in ourselves. We built quality-of-life amenities that have transformed our city into a dynamic home for smart young people and enterprising businesses. Oklahoma City was recently named as the most entrepreneurial city in the country, with the most start-ups per capita.</title></item><item><title>Interestingly, we have NOT done this by creating large amounts of debt. We did something unique for many of our infrastructure packages: we paid cash. Today we are building a community that is more walkable, more sustainable, more affordable and more business-friendly, and we are building it with the kind of common-sense economic policies that we need in Washington, policies that Mitt Romney will deliver as the next president of the United States. Thank you. </title></item></channel></rss>
Mitch McConnell,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Mitch McConnell</title><description>Remarks of Mitch McConnell to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Ladies and Gentlemen. We're here this week for the simple reason that our nation is in desperate need of leadership. And we believe Mitt Romney is the man for the moment. That's the hopeful message coming from Tampa this week: after four long years, help is on the way. America is about to turn the page on Barack Obama's four-year experiment in big government. And it starts by renewing our belief that we're called to something better. Over the past four years Americans have been led to believe we're just like everybody else, that America isn't unique. But it's not true. We are different. Not because of where we were born, but because of who we are as a people. Because of what we have in here. The President scoffs at this idea. To him, this kind of thinking is the problem, not the solution. That's why he's spent the last four years lowering Americans' expectations instead of raising them. That's why he's been missing in action on the greatest challenges of the day. What this administration has in mind for America isn't a renewal, it's a great leveling out.</title></item><item><title>It wants the kind of government-imposed equality that in a single generation transformed Western Europe from a place where for centuries high achievement and discovery and innovation were celebrated and prized, to a place where they have elections about whether people should have to work. Where they make promises they can't keep and write checks they can't cash. But that's not who we are. It just doesn't occur to an American that someone else will solve their problems. Americans take pride in solving problems for themselves. And if we fail, we get back up and try again. It's what we do. It's who we are. This President may want to give up on the problems we face, manage the decline. But the American people don't. And that's why this election is so important. It's a choice about who we are. Are we still a country that takes risks, that innovates, that believes anything is possible? Or are we a country that is resigned to whatever liberty the government decides to dish out? I tell students all the time the only way to fail in America is to quit. I truly believe that. And I know Mitt Romney does too. For four years, Barack Obama has been running from the nation's problems. He hasn't been working to earn reelection. He's been working to earn a spot on the PGA tour. Mitt Romney has spent his entire life finding ways to solve problems. Mitt Romney has never been resigned to what someone else said was possible. He cut his own path. That's why he believes in his heart that America has a future full of opportunity and hope. And that's why when Mitt Romney looks down the road, he sees a country that's ready for a comeback.</title></item><item><title>I firmly believe he's the man to lead it. As we meet here tonight, America is suffering through an economic calamity of truly historic dimensions. Some are calling it the slowest recovery in our nation's entire 236-year history. To call this a recovery is an insult to recoveries. This is not the result of forces beyond our control. It is not the result of some sinister political plot; as some of the more paranoid inhabitants of the left-wing fever swamps would have you believe. It is the result of the policies that Barack Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress spent two full years carefully putting into place, and which they are determined to continue, if they win again. Policies that are meant to gently lull us into a state of lower expectations and diminished dreams. We've gotten a preview of this future over the past few years. We hear the stories every day now. ...the father who puts on a suit every morning and leaves the house so his daughter doesn't know he lost his job. ...the recent college grad facing up to the painful reality that the only door that's open to her after four years of study and a pile of debt is her parents'. These are the faces of the Obama economy. And this is America's future if we don't do something to change the course this President seems perfectly content to leave us on. Think about it. On the same day we learned that unemployment went up in 44 out of 50 states last month, the President of the United States took to the airwaves to tell the people of Albuquerque that he enjoys green chile, but prefers red. We know what the President's got on his iPod, but we don't know what he plans to do about a looming tax hike that could trigger yet another serious recession that would result in even more Americans losing their jobs. Ladies and Gentlemen: America cannot afford another four years of this. For four years, Americans have waited for the faintest light to flicker at the end of the tunnel.</title></item><item><title>And this President has let them down again and again and again. It is time to move on. It is time for a leader who will lead. That leader is Mitt Romney. Thank you! </title></item></channel></rss>
Nikki Haley,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Nikki Haley</title><description>Remarks of Nikki Haley to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants who reminded my brothers, my sister and me every single day how blessed we were to live in this country. They loved the fact that only in America, we could be as successful as we wanted to be and nothing would stand in our way. My parents started a business out of the living room of our home and, 30-plus years later, it was a multimillion dollar company. But there wasn't a single day that was easy and there wasn't a single day my Mom and Dad didn't put everything they had into making that business a success. So, President Obama, with all due respect, don't tell me that my parents didn't build their business. Almost forty-five years after my parents first became Americans, I stand before you and them tonight as the proud governor of the state of South Carolina. We build things in the Palmetto State. We build planes. We build cars. We have three of the four largest tire producers in the world and are about to become the number one tire-producing state in the country. And not too long ago, The Wall Street Journal said, "Anyone still thinking the U.S. has lost its manufacturing chops hasn't been to South Carolina." We have so much potential and so much to be proud of. But like so many states, we have our challenges, whether they be unemployment or education or poverty. And like so many of my fellow governors, I work day in and day out to try and improve the lives of the people of my state. And, sadly, the hardest part of my job continues to be this federal government, this administration, this president.</title></item><item><title>As I said, my parents loved that when they came to America, if you worked hard, the only things that could stop you were the limits you placed on yourself. Unfortunately, these past few years, you can work hard, try to be as successful as possible, follow the rules, and President Barack Obama will do everything he can to stand in your way. South Carolina recently passed one of the most innovative illegal immigration laws in the country. What did this president ­ who has failed to secure our borders and address this issue in any meaningful way ­ do? He sued us. If this President refuses to secure our borders, refuses to protect our citizens from the dangers of illegal immigration, then states have an obligation to take it on ourselves. We said in South Carolina that if you have to show a picture ID to buy Sudafed and you have to show a picture ID to set foot on an airplane, then you should have to show a picture ID to protect one of the most valuable, most central, most sacred rights we are blessed with in America ­ the right to vote. And what happened? President Obama stopped us. And now we come to the most unbelievable of them all. In 2009, South Carolina was blessed to welcome a great American company that chose to stay in our country to continue to do business. That company was Boeing. Boeing started a new line for their 787 Dreamliner, creating 1,000 new jobs in South Carolina, giving our state a shot in the arm when we truly needed it. At the same time, they expanded their job numbers in Washington state by 2,000. Not a single person was hurt by their decision. Not one. And what did President Obama and his National Labor Relations Board do? They sued this iconic American company. It was shameful. And not worthy of the promise of America. But we did one of the things we do best in South Carolina ­ we got loud. We're fighters in South Carolina, and as we fought we watched an amazing thing happen: you fought with us. And guess what, we won. A few months ago, I sat on the tarmac at the Boeing facility in North Charleston and watched as a brand new, mac daddy plane rolled onto the runway sporting a "Made With Pride In South Carolina" decal and surrounded by 6,000 nonunion employees, cheering, smiling and so proud of what they had built. We deserve a president who won't sacrifice American jobs and American workers to pacify the bullying union bosses he counts as political allies.</title></item><item><title>American businesses deserve a federal government that doesn't stand in their way, not one that tries to chase them overseas. Slighting American ingenuity and innovation, that's what this president has meant to South Carolina. That's what this president has meant to this governor. And that's why this governor will not stop fighting until we send him home, back to Chicago, and send Mitt and Ann Romney to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I have had the pleasure of knowing Mitt Romney for several years now. There's so much to appreciate about him. He fixes things. He's results driven. He's taken broken companies and made them successful. He took a failing Olympics and made it a source of pride for our country. He went into a Democratic state, cut taxes, brought in jobs and improved education. Oh, and by the way, he actually balanced his budget. This is a man at peace with who he is, with the challenges he faces, and with what he intends to accomplish. This is a man who is not just a candidate looking to win an election, but a leader yearning to return our nation to its greatest potential. And this is a man who has a silver bullet, his greatest asset, by far, the next First Lady of the United States, Ann Romney. Ann is the perfect combination of strength and grace. She does what so many women in America do ­ she balances, in an exceptional way. She raised five amazing boys, battled MS, is a breast cancer survivor, and through it all was a true partner to Mitt at every turn. Ann Romney makes all women proud by the way she has conducted her life as a strong woman of faith, as a mother, as a wife and as a true patriot. She is an amazing inspiration for me and for so many women across this country. Not too long ago I travelled to Michigan to campaign for the Romneys. Towards the end of the day, two self-described independent voters came up to me and said, "We like all that we hear about Governor Romney, and although we don't know everything about him, what we do know, without a doubt, is that we deserve better than what we have today." They are so right. We deserve a president who will turn our economy around. We deserve a president who will balance our budget.</title></item><item><title>We deserve a president who will reform and protect our retirement programs for future generations. We deserve a president who will fight for American companies, not against them. We deserve a president who will strengthen and support our military, not destabilize them. America deserves better than what we have today. We deserve a President Mitt Romney. Thank you, God bless you, and may He continue to bless the United States of America. </title></item></channel></rss>

I'm Pete Sessions, a Congressman from Dallas, Texas and the Chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. I'm delighted to be here with our team. Our delegates sell the fight every day, in every community across the country, as we stand up to make Barack Obama a one-term president. In 2008, I declared that we would retire Nancy Pelosi ­ and the pundits laughed. I traveled the country recruiting community leaders who, like their neighbors, were concerned for the future of America under the Pelosi-Obama regime. Together, we retired Nancy Pelosi and brought common-sense to the House by placing the gavel firmly in Speaker Boehner's hands. The fight didn't stop there. The Republican message that won us the majority in 2010 ­ implementing free enterprise policies that create jobs, cutting spending and repealing Obamacare ­ will continue to allow us to grow our House Majority, to take back the Senate and make Mitt Romney the next President of the United States. We have a diverse group of competitive candidates this cycle ­ our lead salesmen ­ that will boost the Romney-Ryan ticket. These candidates, many of whom you will hear from shortly, have the will to win. They are on offense to defeat big-government Democrats. Thank you for all you do to help us in our fight to rebuild the American Dream and God Bless America! </title></item></channel></rss>

I bring you greetings from the National Federation of Republican Women, an organization of more than 75,000 Republican women from across the nation. As in every recent election, victory in November will depend on our ability to energize and mobilize women voters. Recently, our National Federation conducted a survey of more than 8,500 Republican women and asked them what they want from their government. Number 1: They want less interference and fewer regulations. Number 2: They want the kind of strong, fiscal conservative leadership that only Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan can deliver. We hear a lot from the media about the Republican's "so-called" war against women. Well, which women? Is it the 850,000 women who have lost their jobs under President Obama? Or the women whose family household income has dropped by $4,300 since the President took office? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women lost 92% of all the jobs lost under the Obama Administration. If there is a war against women, it is President Obama who has waged it.</title></item><item><title>Join us in restoring sanity in our government by electing Governor Mitt Romney and Congressman Paul Ryan.

Here we will nominate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to be the next President and Vice President of the United States of America! But first I would like to offer our thoughts and prayers for the safety of all those in the pathway of the hurricane. On behalf of our party, let me extend our sincere gratitude to the people of Tampa. We're just thrilled to be here--and humbled by your hospitality. Thanks to the tireless work of our convention staff and volunteers, this will be an inspiring three days--a convention truly worthy of the next President of the United States. From this stage, we'll hear from some of our party's most inspiring leaders. With us and with the entire country, they will share their stories and our vision for a better future. We have a message for America: Elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and they will get this country working again. We will restore the idea that every person in America can live the American Dream. We embrace success, and we want everyone to be successful. As we gather here, the nation we love is a country in turmoil. Twenty-three million of our fellow Americans are struggling for work. Families are hurting. Wages are shrinking. The debt is rising. And just to make sure no one forgets that, we've installed two big debt clocks to remind America of Obama's fiscal recklessness. We've seen what Obama and Biden offer. It looks nothing like hope or change. Give them another term, and we'll just get four more years of failure.</title></item><item><title>But with Mitt Romney's experience and Paul Ryan's expertise, we can expect great things from a Romney-Ryan administration. We must send America's comeback team to Washington, so the middle class can thrive--and wages can rise--and our children can succeed once again. Republicans believe American greatness comes from the American people--not from the federal government. But Barack Obama thinks the government is at the center of the economic universe. He thinks that if you started a business, "You didn't build that." Well, how would he know? President Obama's never run a company. He hasn't even run a garage sale or seen the inside of a lemonade stand. So it's time for a President with real experience in the real economy. Mitt Romney will be that President. Barack Obama and his party may be satisfied with attacking the American Dream. But Republicans won't be satisfied until we've rebuilt the American Dream. We will fight for a future where government spends tax dollars wisely. Where every American has the education needed to succeed. Where energy is affordable because America is energy independent, and where the middle class is growing because incomes are rising. We invite all Americans who believe our children deserve this better future to join with us. A victory for the Romney-Ryan ticket is not merely a Republican victory. It is a victory for America. So welcome to Tampa, to our convention, and to the beginning of a better future. Thank you and God Bless you. Let's have a great week. </title></item></channel></rss>
Reince Priebus2,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Reince Priebus Chairman2</title><description>Remarks of Reince Priebus Chairman2 to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 2012 Republican National Convention! Once again, we thank the people of Tampa for their hospitality. Tonight, we embark on a path toward A Better Future. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will lead us. Our timeless, tested Republican principles will light the way. Free enterprise, individual opportunity, limited government. They made America great; only they can keep America strong. The last four years under President Obama have been trying and troubling for this entire country. The tired big government policies of the past have failed us. We can't afford more disappointments. We need a new direction. We need a new president. I know just the man for the job. He's a family man and a businessman. He spent his career building successful companies. Then, he saved the 2002 Olympics and brought pride to our nation. As governor, he balanced the budget, cut taxes, and created jobs. The president America needs is Mitt Romney! Governor Romney has a record of tremendous accomplishments. But he never asks for accolades. He just asks, "How can I help?" That's the mark of a true leader: A humble focus on getting the job done. Mitt Romney spent his life turning around failing enterprises, and America needs a turnaround. Specifically, we need Barack Obama to turn around and go back to Chicago. Let me tell you about my friend Paul Ryan--a man of true integrity. He doesn't descend to the gutter politics of the other side. He rises above it to chart a better path. He's my buddy, my congressman, and I can't wait to call him our vice president!</title></item><item><title>And won't it be nice to have a second-in-command who can spend his days doing more than prying his foot out of his mouth? Paul and Janna's three children are the lights of their lives. In Congress, Paul doesn't worry about his political future. He worries about his children's future. In the same way, Sally and I worry about the future of our two kids, Jack and Grace. Their future is in jeopardy because President Obama has added five trillion dollars to the national debt for all our children to pay off. That's unacceptable. Our Founders did not declare our independence only to see us become dependent on the borrowed money of foreign nations. We still have time to chart a better course. But if Barack Obama gets four more years, it might be too late. We're not just spending borrowed money; we're living on borrowed time. Look at the record of the outgoing administration: 23 million Americans, struggling for work. Forty-two months of unemployment over 8 percent. The worst jobs record since the Great Depression. It's time to elect Mitt Romney so we can get moving on the Great Recovery. Now the Obama apologists in the mainstream media - they say, oh, it's not his fault. Well, I have news for the media. We know things were bad. But that's no excuse for making things worse. Four years ago, Barack Obama was an unproven leader. Today, he has proven himself. He has proven that he's not up to the job. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will be up to the job on Day One. Like Paul Ryan, I'm from Wisconsin, where Republicans have done pretty well in recent years. Here's why: because we governed like we campaigned. We made promises and we kept promises. That's what Americans want - leaders of their word. President Obama is a man of many words - but he's not a man of his word. He broke his promise to cut the deficit in half. And he broke his promise to fix the economy. And adding insult to injury, he actually attacks success. This president looks down on American free enterprise. He says, "If you've got a business, you didn't build that." That makes me think Barack Obama has a problem with the American Dream. I grew up in a place called Kenosha, Wisconsin. My dad was a union electrician and retired from the Racine Unified School District. You know, when we drove through town, he didn't point at that big beautiful house on the corner and say, "Hey look at those lousy people over here."</title></item><item><title>He did what every one of your parents did. He said, "Listen up pal, if you work hard and go to school, you're going to be in that house. And mom and dad pray it's three times bigger." No parent, Democrat or Republican, wants the kind of negative, glass-half-empty view of America that President Obama is trying to sell. We're the party that celebrates success, that believes in the American Dream and wants all of our children to have a chance to succeed. So this convention is an invitation to all Americans to join us as we fight for a better future. This is our generation's Rendezvous with Destiny. It's our Time for Choosing. If you believe America can do better than the last four years, we stand with you. If you believe the next generation deserves a shot at the American Dream, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan stand with you. Thank you and God bless. </title></item></channel></rss>

In NC we tell the truth. The truth is you can't support open-ended bailouts and giveaways if you want to create jobs. You can't support Obamacare and say you're saving Medicare. And you cannot support Barack Obama if you want to stop the spending, stop the waste and stop the assault on our values. This election is about real people ­ people who are suffering under the policies of President Obama and his friends like Larry Kissell. It's about the woman in Thomasville who told me she has to support two men at home ­ her husband who was laid off and her recent college graduate son who can't find a job. And it's about the home builder in Monroe who will take any kind of work just to avoid laying off any more employees. The people of NC are suffering under President Obama. It's not just time for a change ­ it's time for the great American comeback! I give you my word, I will fight every day for what's right. Because it's not about politics, it's about people. It's about our future. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are right for America.</title></item><item><title>Obama and Biden are just wrong! Thank you. God bless you.

President Obama has put America on the wrong track, but my home state, North Dakota, shows a different way forward. We have less than 3% unemployment, rising salaries, and a budget surplus. Mr. President, if you're still looking for an example where the private sector is actually doing fine, you can look to North Dakota. That is because we don't burden our job creators with red tape. We understand ­ just like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan ­ that small businesses are the engines of our economy, so we get government out of their way and let entrepreneurs build their businesses. We trust the individual ­ not big government ­ to make decisions about their money, families, and opportunities. This is the North Dakota way. And it works. Mitt Romney shares an understanding of the solutions North Dakota has developed and is prepared to lead where President Obama has left broken promises.</title></item><item><title>With Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in the White House and a Republican majority in the Senate, our North Dakota way can be the American way. Thank you and God Bless. </title></item></channel></rss>
Rick Santorum,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Rick Santorum</title><description>Remarks of Rick Santorum to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>It's an honor to be here tonight with the love of my life, Karen, my 93-year-old mother and some of our kids. You think it's crowded in here, good thing I didn't bring all my kids. I am a first-generation American. At age seven, my dad came to Johnstown, Pennsylvania from the mountains of northern Italy, on a ship named Providence. How providential that one day his son would announce for President just down the road from the deep mines where his father -- my grandfather -- mined coal `til he was 72 years old. When my grandfather died, I remember as a kid kneeling at his casket and not being able to take my eyes off his thick strong hands -- hands that dug his path in life -- and gave his family a chance -- at living the American Dream. Working the mines may not have been the dream he dreamed ­ I never dared to ask him ­ but I think his answer would have been that America gave him more than he had ever hoped. America believed in him, that's why he believed in America. My grandfather, like millions of other immigrants, didn't come here for some government guarantee of income equality or government benefits to take care of his family. In 1923 there were no government benefits for immigrants except one: Freedom! Under President Obama, the dream of freedom and opportunity has become a nightmare of dependency with almost half of America receiving some government benefit.</title></item><item><title>It is no surprise fewer and fewer Americans are achieving their dreams and more and more parents are concerned their children won't realize theirs. President Obama spent four years and borrowed five trillion dollars, trying to convince you that he could make things better for you ---- to put your trust in him and the government to take care of every problem. The result -- massive debt, anemic growth and millions more unemployed. The President's plan didn't work for America, because that's not how America works. In America we believe in freedom and the responsibility that comes with it to work hard to make that dream of reaching our God-given potential come true. We believe it because it still works. Even today. Graduate from high school, work hard, and get married before you have children and the chance you will ever be in poverty is just two percent. Yet if you don't do these three things you're 38 times more likely to end up in poverty! We understand many Americans don't succeed because the family that should be there to guide them, and serve as the first rung on the ladder of success, isn't there or is badly broken. The fact is that marriage is disappearing in places where government dependency is highest. Most single mothers do heroic work and an amazing job raising their children, but if America is going to succeed, we must stop the assault on marriage and the family. From lowering taxes to reforming social programs, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are dedicated to restoring the home where married moms and dads are pillars of strong communities raising good citizens. A solid education should be the second rung on the ladder to success, but the system is failing. President Obama's solution has been to deny parents choice, attack private schools and nationalize curriculum and student loans. Mitt Romney believes that parents and the local community must be put in charge -- not the Department of Education. We all know there is one key to success that has helped people overcome even the greatest of obstacles - hard work. That's why work was the centerpiece of the bipartisan welfare reform law.</title></item><item><title>Requiring work as a condition for receiving welfare succeeded -- and not just because the welfare rolls were cut in half -- but because employment went way up, poverty went down and dreams were realized. It's a sturdy ladder to success that is built with healthy families, education and hard work. But President Obama's policies undermine the traditional family, weaken the education system. And this summer he showed us once again he believes in government handouts and dependency by waiving the work requirement for welfare. I helped write welfare reform; we made the law crystal clear - no president can waive the work requirement. But as with his refusal to enforce our immigration laws, President Obama rules like he is above the law. America take heed, when a president can simply give a speech or write a memo and change the law to do what the law says he can't, we weaken our republic. Yet as my family and I crisscrossed America, something became so obvious to us. America is still the greatest country in the world ­ and with God's help and good leadership we can restore the American Dream. Why? I held its hand. I shook the hand of the American Dream. And it has a strong grip. I shook hands of farmers and ranchers who made America the bread basket of the world. Hands weathered and worn. And proud of it. I grasped dirty hands with scars that come from years of labor in the oil and gas fields, mines and mills. Hands that power and build America and are stewards of the abundant resources that God has given us. I gripped hands that work in restaurants and hotels, in hospitals, banks, and grocery stores. Hands that serve and care for all of us. I clasped hands of men and women in uniform and their families. Hands that sacrifice and risk all to protect and keep us free. And hands that pray for their safe return home. I held hands that are in want. Hands looking for the dignity of a good job, hands growing weary of not finding one but refusing to give up hope. And finally, I cradled the little, broken hands of the disabled. Hands that struggle and bring pain, hands that ennoble us and bring great joy.</title></item><item><title>They came to see us ­ oh did they come -- when they found out Karen and I are blessed with caring for someone very special too, our Bella. Four and a half years ago I stood over a hospital isolette staring at the tiny hands of our newborn daughter who we hoped was perfectly healthy. But Bella's hands were just a little different ­ and I knew different wasn't good news. The doctors later told us Bella was incompatible with life and to prepare to let go. They said, even if she did survive, her disabilities would be so severe that Bella would not have a life worth living. We didn't let go and today Bella is full of life and she has made our lives and countless others much more worth living. I thank God that America still has one party that reaches out their hands in love to lift up all of God's children ­ born and unborn ­ and says that each of us has dignity and all of us have the right to live the American Dream. And without you America is not keeping faith with that dream. We are stewards of a great inheritance. In November we have a chance to vote for life and liberty, not dependency. A vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will put our country back in the hands of leaders who understand what America can and, for the sake of our children, must be to keep the dream alive. </title></item></channel></rss>
Ricky Gill,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Ricky Gill</title><description>Remarks of Ricky Gill to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>My name is Ricky Gill, and I am humbled to stand before you as a Republican nominee for Congress ­ and a proud son of California's San Joaquin Valley. My parents immigrated to the Valley from India and Africa with only their love for each other, a strong work ethic, and the enduring desire to pursue their American Dream. We all work hard in the Valley, and we're proud to live there. But today we face crippling unemployment and foreclosures ­ even the bankruptcy of Stockton, our largest city. Young people leave -- or drop out of school to help their families make ends meet. Our friends and neighbors are suffering. But the Valley is a cautionary tale of failed policies, not false ambitions. No one in this country dreams of dependency; no one hopes for mediocrity. We are ready again to seize the measure of our ambitions ­ not because the government says we can, but because we believe we can. We need a new generation of leadership to chart the path ­ to fight for policies that create jobs, rather than red tape ­ and to help small businesses succeed, rather than helping green energy companies fail. Like you, we Valley folks are tough, independent, and faithful ­ and we are ready to rebuild our American Dream.</title></item><item><title>Thank you, and God Bless America. </title></item></channel></rss>
Rob Portman,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Rob Portman</title><description>Remarks of Rob Portman to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Good evening America, and hello to the fired-up delegation from the Buckeye State right in front of me. My name is Rob Portman and they say I was on Governor Romney's short list of vice presidential candidates. Apparently, it wasn't short enough. But it's been a great convention and I am delighted to be here tonight to talk about the fundamental differences between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama when it comes to understanding our economy. Let's begin by talking about something the Democrats love to demonize - Mitt Romney's success in the private sector. He built a company from the ground up, created lots of jobs, and yes, he made money. He made it the old fashioned way . . . He earned it. Then you have Barack Obama, who has never started a business--never even worked in business. And he claims those who have should give credit to the government or someone else for their success. So, you have one candidate who understands that success comes from working hard, competing and taking risks. And you have another candidate who believes success comes from government. Which one do you think knows how to turn this economy around? Which one would you choose to invest your life's savings?</title></item><item><title>Should it be any different for safeguarding our nation's economy? Or let's say you don't have any savings. Let's say you're worried about how to pay September's rent or mortgage. Let's say you are one of the millions of Americans out of work or the millions more who have given up looking. You've gotta be running out of patience ­ and hope. You have to be tired, looking for a new start. Well, you don't have to be patient any longer. Through your vote this fall you can change the leadership of this country and the opportunities for you and your family. America, it has been nearly four years of over eight percent unemployment ­ and double digit unemployment for young people, Hispanics and African-Americans. Four years. FDR and Truman won an entire world war in four years. America is tired of waiting. In business, if you don't move rapidly, you are out of business. You are finished. We want a president who operates at business speed not government speed. President Obama says he deserves reelection because his economic policies have worked. NOT in this universe they haven't. In fact, the experts tell us that if we don't change our policies we are going back into recession next year. Tens of millions of Americans are not out of the last recession! Governor Romney had a plan to build his business. He now has a detailed plan to restore our economy and strengthen the middle class. I ask you: Where is the president's economic plan? Blaming others does not qualify as a plan. Now the president did submit a budget. It was so bad that not a single Republican or a single Democrat in the entire United States Congress would vote for it. He got zero votes. That is a failure of leadership.</title></item><item><title>President Obama has been right about at least one prediction he's made about the economy. He said, "If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition." I think you are right about that, Mr. President. It hasn't worked, because you cannot spend your way, regulate your way, tax your way or blame your way out of the economic mess we are in. You have to liberate the productive power of the American people through policies that encourage innovation, risk taking, investment and jobs. And you have to compete and win in the global economy. Governor Romney understands this. In contrast, President Obama is the first president in 75 years--Democrat or Republican--who hasn't even sought the ability to negotiate export agreements and open markets overseas. Now why is this important? Because 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside our borders. And to create jobs, our workers and our farmers need to sell more of what we make to those people. While this administration has been dragging its feet, other countries have been busy negotiating hundreds of new trade agreements to benefit their workers and their farmers, taking away our opportunities. President Obama has been so driven to advance his big government ideology that he has abandoned the daily economic work that a government must do to open markets, restore business confidence and create the climate for job growth. This is the work President Romney would begin on day one. Take trade with China. China manipulates its currency giving it an unfair trade advantage. So why doesn't the president do something about it? I'll tell you one reason ­ President Obama could not run up his record trillion dollar deficits if the Chinese did not buy our bonds to finance them. We are as beholden to China for bonds as we are to the Middle East for oil. This will end under Mitt Romney. We need to knock down these trade barriers abroad, but we also need to knock down the selfimposed barriers to success right here at home. We need to reform our outdated and complicated tax code. We need to fix our burdensome regulatory system and we need an energy policy that encourages development of our resources right here, in the ground, in America.</title></item><item><title>America has a choice between Mitt Romney, who seeks to grow the economy, and Barack Obama who seeks to redistribute it. Which one do you think will liberate America's entrepreneurial spirit? At the other party's convention, you will hear the chant, "Four more years. Four more years." Folks ­ we can't afford four more years. How about no more years? Governor Romney chose a terrific partner in Paul Ryan of Wisconsin ­ Paul is a close friend with a great family and a reformer's heart. Vice President Biden has told people out of work to just, "hang in there." So much for hope and change. Paul Ryan is not asking America to continue to hang in there. He is proposing new policies that will give poor and middle class families opportunities and hope for the future. Mitt Romney made his mark turning around businesses and solving problems. Paul Ryan made his mark as a respected reformer focused on results. Together they will do what President Obama has not done: They will lead in breaking through the partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C. America, give them the chance to restore America's economy and restore the American dream. I have seen that dream up close. When I was a kid, my dad left his job as a salesman and started his own business selling forklift trucks. My Mom was the bookkeeper. He had to borrow money from her uncle because the bank wouldn't give him a loan. He lost money for the first few years, but he never lost his dream. And by the time he retired and my brother took over, the business had 200 employees ­ supporting 200 families in Southwest Ohio. This is the classic American story ­ not of government telling us what to do ­ but of free men and free women willing to work hard and take a risk to build something of value for themselves, their families and their community. About a year into the Obama Administration ­ I asked my dad whether he would do it again. He said, "Rob ­ with all the uncertainty out there today ­ I don't know if I would take the risk." In that one sentence, he summed up what I've heard from hundreds of small business owners across Ohio and around this great country. They're afraid to make the investment and jobs are the casualty.</title></item><item><title>Ladies and gentlemen, we need new leadership and new policies to bring back the dream and renew America's promise. No more excuses, no more blaming others, no more waiting. We need Romney /Ryan and we need them now! And with your help, it will happen. Thank you and God bless our great country. </title></item></channel></rss>

One of the folks that Mitt Romney brought in to help save the Salt Lake Olympics told me, "Every day on the way to work, you would say to yourself ­ that you owed it to Mitt to be better today than you were yesterday!" If ever there was a time that Americans need to be inspired to be better today than yesterday, that time is now. If ever there was a time that we needed someone to inspire us to do great things, that time is now! Today we come together as a party to nominate for president a man who will energize and inspire this country. The time has come for a new day in America.

Scott Walker,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Scott Walker</title><description>Remarks of Scott Walker to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Thank you and good evening. On June 5th, voters in Wisconsin were asked to choose between going backwards to the days of double-digit tax increases, billion dollar budget deficits and record job losses OR moving forward with reforms that lowered the tax burden, balanced the budget and helped small businesses create more jobs. On June 5th, voters in my swing state were asked to decide if they wanted elected officials who measure success by how many people are dependent on the government OR if they wanted leaders who believe success is measured by how many people are not dependent on the government, because they control their own destiny in the private sector. On June 5th, voters in Wisconsin got to determine who was in charge ­ was it the big government special interests in Washington... or the hard-working tax payers of our state. The good news is that ­ on June 5th ­ the hard-working taxpayers won. Just ask Sandy Breth why that's important. When the economy took a dive a few years ago, she took a pay cut. Not long after that, she lost her job. Today, however, she's working at G3 Industries in Mosinee, Wisconsin. In fact, she just received a promotion. G3 is one of those companies that added jobs during the past year, and now has plans to add even more. The owner told me that he's creating additional jobs in Wisconsin because he likes the way we are moving our state forward ­ and he's even more committed since the election. Without our positive changes, he told me he would not have had the confidence to grow his business in Wisconsin. Improving the business climate is not only good for small business owners; it's good for people like Sandy and her family.</title></item><item><title>We need more stories like hers in America because the past couple of years have been well, pretty tough. Like many places across the country, Wisconsin lost more than 100,000 jobs from 2008 to 2010. Unemployment during that time topped out at over 9%. But because of our reforms, Wisconsin has added thousands of new jobs and our unemployment rate is down from when I first took office. Equally as important, we improved the economic climate for job creators. Today, 94% of our employers believe Wisconsin is headed in the right direction. That compares to just 10% who thought the same thing two years ago. Elections have consequences! As was the case in Wisconsin two years ago, too many Americans think our country is headed in the wrong direction. But Mitt Romney understands, like I understand, that people ­ not governments ­ create jobs. With that in mind, my Administration is making it easier for people to create jobs in Wisconsin. Our reforms put the hard working taxpayers back in charge ­ people like Sandy Breth. Sadly, the federal government seems to be going in the opposite direction. Nationally, we've experienced 42 consecutive months of unemployment above 8%. Last month, 44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate. And more than 12 million of our fellow citizens are unemployed. We need someone to turn things around in America. That leader is Governor Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney turned businesses around in the private sector. He saved the Winter Olympics. And he balanced state budgets without raising taxes, and in a way that helped the private sector create more jobs. Then, with the announcement of Paul Ryan as his running mate, Governor Romney not only showed that he has the experience and the skill needed to become president, he showed he has the courage and the passion to be an exceptional president. With this pick he showed us that the "R" next to his name doesn't just stand for Republican, it stands for Reformer.</title></item><item><title>Now, more than ever, we need reformers: leaders who think more about the next generation than just the next election. That's what you get from Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. In a few weeks, we will celebrate the 225th anniversary of our federal Constitution. Moments like that remind us that what makes America so great, what makes us exceptional, is that throughout our history, in moments of crisis, be they economic or fiscal, military or spiritual. What makes America amazing is that there have always been men and women of courage who were willing to think more about the future of their children and grandchildren than they did about their own political careers. Let this be one of those moments. Let this be our time in history so that someday we can tell our children and grandchildren that we were there, that we changed the course of history for the better. Let us tell them that we helped elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to save America. Thank you. </title></item></channel></rss>

Hello delegates! I am a proud member of the Party of Reagan, Romney and Ryan. As a father of six, my biggest worry is that our children are losing their shot at the American Dream. Today, record unemployment is dashing the dreams of our college graduates: instead of moving onto their dream jobs, they're moving into their parents' basement. The debt we're passing off to our kids is a shameful legacy. And Obama's big government policies have made this the worst recovery since the Great Depression. This is not a liberal problem. It's not a conservative problem. This economy is America's problem! Obama's quest to spread the wealth has only managed to spread the misery. We have a better idea. Let's spread the economic growth! And we will spread it from the breweries of Wisconsin to the barrios of California. If you voted for Obama and you have buyer's remorse, let me tell you, Mitt Romney is the hope and Paul Ryan is the change.</title></item><item><title>A vote for Romney / Ryan is a vote for a dream ticket -- a dream ticket that will end the Obama economic nightmare.

Welcome everyone to my home State of Florida! We are honored to host you and I am honored to serve as the RNC Co-Chair. Every election we hear that this is the most important election of our lifetime. This election is more than that. It is the most important election in our nation's lifetime. In 1775 our Founding Fathers rose up to establish our liberty. Today, we need to defeat a President whose actions threaten our liberty! In this way, we are in a similar position as our Founding Fathers. Just as they were called upon, we are being called upon. What they started, what they believed in, we must defend! The danger for America is already here, in the form of the Democratic leaders in Washington. We have a Democrat Senate leader who refuses to meet his moral obligation to pass a budget for the government. We have a Democrat House leader that wouldn't allow a major piece of legislation--Obama Care--to be read before it was passed. She stated to the world, and I quote "We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it." We have a President that has bypassed the Senate confirmation process in order to appoint unaccountable czars to make and enforce policies on America's citizens. A President that by executive action has changed immigration laws, imposed unconstitutional burdens on our states, and issued over-reaching regulations.</title></item><item><title>We know the problem, America--their names are Obama ­ Biden ­ Reid ­ Pelosi ­ Holder. What they have done--and will continue to do, should Obama be re-elected--runs contrary to the values we believe in and the principles we stand for. It is our duty, as citizen activists, of this great Republican Party, to fight to restore the values of our Founding Fathers. My fellow members, this fight is not just about an election, and it is not about our party. Our fight is about our country, and we must not lose! Our Founding Fathers made huge personal sacrifices for what they believed in. The time is now for us to do the same! I am a proud grassroots activist, one of many in my state and countless others from across the country. Today we need as many grassroots activists from all walks of life and throughout this great nation to stand with us. The sacrifices we need to make are nothing compared to the sacrifices our children and our grandchildren will face if we don't take back our country on November 6th. We must take this election house-by-house, precinct-by-precinct, city-by-city, state-by-state, to bring our proud conservative message of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to every voter. When we leave Florida in a few days, let's commit ourselves to give all that we can to help the Romney/Ryan ticket. Together, let's make history. Together, let's defeat Barack Obama. Together, let's save our country for the next generation. Thank you. God bless each of you. God bless our proud military and their families and may God continue to bless the United States of America. </title></item></channel></rss>
Sher Valenzuela,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Sher Valenzuela</title><description>Remarks of Sher Valenzuela to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Good evening. My name is Sher Valenzuela. Two years ago, I never would have imagined that I would be here tonight, speaking at the Republican National Convention. I've seen these on TV ­ what an honor to be here with you. I'm a mother from Delaware, a co-owner with my husband of First State Manufacturing. And after this November, I plan on taking on a new title: the next Lieutenant Governor of the Great State of Delaware. Tonight, it is my honor to talk about the three themes that inspired me to run for office:    My family. The business we built. And my belief in America's unlimited potential.</title></item><item><title>But it starts with a wonderful story. Shortly after our son was born, my husband and I received some news that would change our lives forever. We learned that our son Simon was autistic. We loved him with every fiber in our being. But the "experts" told us not to expect much. "Your son will never learn to read, write, or communicate effectively," they said. "Accept these limits," they seemed to say. It was a tough time.</title></item><item><title>We quickly realized that the jobs we had wouldn't pay for the professionals Simon needed to overcome the odds. So we followed a deep and long-standing American tradition. We took a risk. We bet on the future. We started our own business. When he was serving in the Army, my husband had taken a mail order course on upholstery. One day I came home to find him pulling out the second hand sewing machine he'd learned his craft on. He called her "Old Betsy." A second-generation Mexican-American, my husband will do whatever it takes to provide for his family. Our friends thought we were crazy. Didn't we have enough challenges trying to raise Simon? Why not just accept our lot in life? That's when I remembered something my dad used to say. My dad was an old school guy. A former drill sergeant. Blue collar union worker his whole life. He taught us to work hard and think big. I remember he once pulled off the road and pointed at a big factory. "That's more than a building," he told me. "It took a lot of work to get that big. It started out as just an idea at some guy's kitchen table." I guess you could say our upholstery business was OUR kitchen table idea. Fifteen years later we employ more than 70 people in our 70,000 square foot factory. And we're so proud of what we do. We make umpire vests for Little Leagues. Products for the men and women serving our country. Restaurant seats for pizza chains. And protective gear for our allies in the Israeli military. We're actually taking work away from Chinese and Mexican competitors ­ and bringing it back to Delaware! How did it happen?</title></item><item><title>We defied the odds. We rolled the dice on losing ­ or gaining ­ everything. We didn't listen to the experts. We grew our dream. And with our son Simon, we didn't listen to the experts either. Yes, he still struggles with autism. But this past June, he completed his first year at the University of Delaware. I can't tell you how much this means to him ­ and how much it means to me, the mom of a special needs child. Raising our family and building our business have been the passions of our lives, and what struck me is how similar they are. If you've ever raised a child or started a business, you know what I'm talking about. You put your heart and soul into it. You work to find the 25th hour in the day You struggle to overcome insurmountable odds. And you do it all because you believe in an unlimited future. "An unlimited future." Isn't that what America is all about? But today, when I talk to the young families and the struggling businesses I meet throughout Delaware, I have to ask: are we creating an unlimited future for them? A Gallup report recently said nearly 50% of small businesses owners aren't hiring because of what they call "regulatory uncertainty." Can you blame them? This Administration has imposed 106 new major regulations. They are on track to create 109 million new paperwork burden hours. And by year's end, $110 billion dollars' worth of new regulatory costs will be laid on the backs of business owners and taxpayers. You might call that "regulatory uncertainty." I call it an all-out assault on free enterprise. That's what worries me about this Administration. They seem so eager to "fix" society. But they don't have a clue about how to fix the economy.</title></item><item><title>In the end, it all comes down to what you believe. And yes, they are believers! The Obama Administration believes in "experts" and blue ribbon panels. They believe in creating new agencies and boards. They believe in all that ­ but they just don't trust the entrepreneur's ability to grow her own business and to create jobs. Mitt Romney not only believes in the values of economic freedom. His entire life has been committed to advancing it. Last April, I was privileged to be one of a dozen business leaders in Delaware to sit down and meet with Mitt Romney. This wasn't some scripted photo op; this wasn't a staged event; this was a real discussion with someone who understands where small business is coming from. You see, for Governor Romney, free enterprise isn't just a theory you study in graduate school. It's a creed. A commitment. A world view. It's what connects Americans, families, and communities, to an unlimited future. That's why this election is so important to our small businesses and to our country. I represent the small businesses, the women, and the families working so hard to rebuild our communities. In order to secure our unlimited future, we need a leader who understands the moral case for free enterprise. Someone who believes in an unlimited future. These aren't just words to Mitt Romney. His track record proves it. Let's secure that future together by sending Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to the White House in November! Dios lo Bendiga! God Bless America!</title></item><item><title></title></item></channel></rss>
Steve Cohen,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Steve Cohen</title><description>Remarks of Steve Cohen to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Good evening, My name is Steven Cohen and I am president of Screen Machine Industries, a family-owned manufacturer of construction and mining equipment located in the great Buckeye State of Ohio. And, yes, we did build this company. Our country's nearly 30 million small businesses serve as the American backbone for job creation and product innovation. The opportunity to create new products and open new markets is the American Dream. This capitalistic spirit has supported our economy since its founding. As a manufacturer, our products are the heartbeat of our business. We can't tolerate other companies stealing our hard work without compensation. It can take several years and tens of thousands of dollars to achieve patent status. Once granted, we expect it to be protected. Our products are often stolen and copied overseas for a mere fraction of the price. All too often tariffs and unfair trade practices make it difficult for American businesses to export. We need a new president that will protect America's patented inventions, guard the value of our currency and open new markets for American products. American small businesses face a mountain of regulations and taxes. In addition, our international competitors do not have to face the upcoming costs associated with funding a multibillion dollar health care plan, overreaching emission standards, and the</title></item><item><title>unnecessary "War on Coal." These factors create a tremendous disadvantage in the global market place. We need an administration that will lessen tax burdens and government regulations that strangle small businesses. While we face higher government-imposed costs, cheaper imports from overseas companies flood our markets. Unnecessary regulations and mandates imposed on business make our products more expensive to make and less competitive to sell. We need a Romney administration to ensure our country's competitiveness and give our companies the opportunity to expand and hire again. Let's bring back that original American will to invent, employ and prosper! Thank you. </title></item></channel></rss>
Steve Daines,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Steve Daines</title><description>Remarks of Steve Daines to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Thank you. In 1984, as a young delegate from the great state of Montana, I cast my vote for President Ronald Reagan in Dallas. For the past 28 years, I have built businesses and created hundreds of jobs. My wife Cindy and I have been married for 25 years and are the parents of four great kids. Now, out-of-control spending, crushing debt, and job-destroying regulations threaten our children's future. We have more government than ever before. Our economy is stagnant, families are struggling, and the America we love is threatened. Washington does NOT create jobs, the people do. I'm grateful that six generations of my family have called Montana home. My great-great grandmother left Norway and came to Montana in search of a better future. As a widow with seven children, she homesteaded on the plains of northern Montana. On her tombstone are three simple words: "Saved by Grace." The words "Saved by Government" would never have crossed her mind. She put her faith in God not Government. In 70 days, our country faces a pivotal election -- and our choice is clear. We can do better and we will do better when we elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.</title></item><item><title>Thank you and God bless. </title></item></channel></rss>
Steve King,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Steve King</title><description>Remarks of Steve King to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Good evening. In two short months, our country faces a momentous decision. We will decide whether to continue our slide into debt and dependence, or whether to restore opportunity and self-determination. I believe, at this time, America is looking for leadership. Americans are searching for substance. We are here tonight because Mitt Romney has chosen the first real leader of his generation, a man who can help us believe in America again -- and his name is Paul Ryan! We are here tonight, as Republicans, united and excited for a Romney-Ryan presidency! I remember talking with Paul when he was weighing his first congressional race. Even at the age of 27, he was a man with big ideas and the courage of his convictions. Paul's time in politics has been a family affair. His brother Tobin helped lead Paul's first campaign. His mother Betty and sister-in-law Oakleigh knocked on doors and handed out fliers. Now Paul is joined by his wife Janna, his daughter Liza, and his sons Charlie and Sam. You'll find them in church and later watching a Packers or Brewers game, or swapping hunting and fishing stories with family. From his very first campaign, Paul Ryan asked voters directly: "Hire me." And has since always reminded his constituents: "Remember, I work for you!" He never forgets who he works for. And no one has been more diligent and effective in working for the good of Wisconsin and America. Paul Ryan has the courage to tell the truth ­ even when the truth is hard to hear. Paul Ryan has big, thoughtful ideas. Paul Ryan has the determination to tackle tough challenges ­ even those that others choose to ignore.</title></item><item><title>Paul Ryan is the leader we need at this critical moment in our nation's history. Mitt Romney believes that. Do we? Ladies and gentlemen, it is my singular great honor and distinct privilege to nominate my good friend, my fellow citizen of Janesville, Wisconsin, a genuinely good man from the Midwest -- Paul D. Ryan -- to be vice president of the United States of America! Thank you! </title></item></channel></rss>
Tad True,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Tad True</title><description>Remarks of Tad True to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Thank you. Ladies and Gentlemen: Energy powers everything we do and America depends on reliable and affordable energy. This is a simple concept, but the Obama administration does not get it. His policies are driving us away from energy independence, not towards it. Mitt Romney knows that we need an "All of the Above" energy policy that includes oil, gas, and coal and renewable sources -- like wind and solar -- so that we can finally secure energy independence for our country. Infrastructure is fundamental to all energy systems. And infrastructure is critical to achieving energy independence infrastructure -- like pipelines. Which prompts me to ask: Mr. President, where is the Keystone Pipeline? I am part of the third generation of family-owned businesses, and we operate pipelines in the great states of Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana. These companies were started by my grandfather, and then run by my father and uncles. Between them -- and our 152 dedicated and incredibly talented employees -- we built almost 4,000 miles of pipeline. A lot of our recent work has been constructing new pipeline infrastructure in western North Dakota to support the development of the Bakken oil shale -- an exciting and important development for America.</title></item><item><title>Some time ago, we agreed to build the "on-ramp" to the Keystone XL pipeline, so that it could take American produced oil to American markets. If Keystone had received timely approval of their permit, it would be under construction today. Instead, Americans have missed out on jobs from this pipeline because the Obama Administration has played politics with the Keystone project. My hope is that my 3 boys -- Henry, Sam, and Charlie -- will be part of the fourth generation of our family business. And although my kids think pipelines are boring, I know and you know and Mitt Romney knows that pipelines are vital to America's energy system. Ladies and Gentlemen: This is not about just one pipeline. This is about a fundamental transformation of America's energy system so that we can achieve that long-sought after goal of energy independence. More importantly, it's about my 3 boys and your children and about re-building a nation that can once again power itself. We need a president who understands that we need all of that energy all of that oil all of those jobs. And we need a president that understands that America needs that pipeline. That president is Mitt Romney. Thank you.</title></item><item><title></title></item></channel></rss>
Ted Cruz,<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><rss version="2.0"><channel><title>Ted Cruz</title><description>Remarks of Ted Cruz to the Republican National Convention, Tampa, August 2012</description><item><title>Good evening. I have the honor of standing before you this evening for one reason, because thousands upon thousands of grassroots activists stood united, not for a candidate, but for the sake of restoring liberty. Accountability, quite rightly, rests firmly in the hands of "We the People." Since 2010, something extraordinary has been happening, something that has dumbfounded the chattering class. It began here in Florida in 2010. In Utah, Kentucky, Pennsylvania. Was repeated this summer in Indiana. Nebraska. Wisconsin. And this past month, in the Lone Star State, Texas. What is happening all across America is a Great Awakening. A response to career politicians in both parties who've gotten us into this mess. This national movement is fueled by what unites us: a love of liberty, a belief in the unlimited potential of free men and women. I want to tell you a love story. It's the story of all of us, a love story of freedom. It's the story of our Founding Fathers, who fought and bled for freedom and then crafted the most miraculous political document ever conceived, our Constitution. The Framers understood that our rights come, not from monarchs, but from God--and that those rights are secure only when government power is restrained.</title></item><item><title>This love story is the story of the brave Texans in the City of Gonzales. When General Santa Anna demanded that they give up their guns and the cannon that guarded the city, they responded with the immortal cry "Come and take it." It's the story of the greatest generation of Americans, who rose up to confront the grotesque evil that was the Nazis, and ushered in the greatest era of peace and prosperity the world has ever seen. It's the story of civil-rights heroes, like Dr. Martin Luther King, who stood strong against the scourge of discrimination, and bravely championed that every man and woman should be judged, not by the color of our skin, but by the content of our character. It's the story of President Ronald Reagan, who turned back the creeping growth of government and restored Morning in America. Who spoke out against the oppressive evil of communism and demanded "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall." It's the story of my Mom. Irish and Italian, working class, the first in her family to go to college ­ a pioneering mathematician and computer programmer in the 1950s. It's the story of my Dad, who was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba, beaten nearly to death. He fled to Texas in 1957, not speaking English, with $100 sewn into his underwear. He washed dishes making 50 cents an hour to pay his way through the University of Texas, and to start a small business in the oil and gas industry. My father is here tonight. When he came to America, él no tenía nada, pero tenía corazón. He had nothing, but he had heart. A heart for freedom. Thank you, Dad. It's the story of each and every one of you. We are all sons and daughters of those who risked everything for freedom, and we have the duty to pass that same opportunity to the generations to follow. And yet today, many in Washington seem content to saddle our children with a financial debt larger than our nation has ever seen. Government is out of control, and we're going broke. But I'm here with a word of encouragement. Millions of Americans are standing up, saying we want our country back. Republicans, Democrats, and independents. We will not follow the path of Greece; we will not go quietly into the night. This election presents a stark choice. Two visions: we can continue down the road of the Obama Democrats, towards more and more spending, debt and government control of the economy and</title></item><item><title>our lives. Or we can return to the founding principles of our nation--free markets, fiscal responsibility, and individual liberty. Unfortunately, President Obama's campaign is going to try to divide America. They're going to try to separate us into little groups, and try to scare everybody. They're going to tell seniors that Medicare will be taken away, tell Hispanics that we're not welcome here and send the Vice President to preach a message of division. It's sad, how far we've come from hope and change. All of this is designed to distract from the real issues that matter. Twenty-three million Americans struggling for work. Sixteen trillion dollars in national debt. Government takeovers of healthcare, of financial services and many aspects of our economy. Imagine, for a moment, if someone surreptitiously charged hundreds of thousands of dollars on your credit cards, saddling your kids with debts they could never escape. That's exactly the impact of this administration's misguided policies. Heidi and I are blessed with two little girls, Caroline and Catherine, 4 and 1. When Caroline was born, our national debt was $10 trillion. Today, as the debt clock shows, it's $16 trillion, larger than our gross domestic product. How do we turn things around? How do we get America back to work? President Obama thinks the answer is more and more government. Government is not the answer. You are not doing anyone a favor by creating dependency, destroying individual responsibility. Fifty-five years ago, when my dad was a penniless teenage immigrant, thank God some wellmeaning bureaucrat didn't put his arm around him and say let me take care of you. Let me give you a government check and make you dependent on government. And by the way, don't bother learning English. That would have been the most destructive thing anyone could have done. Instead, my parents worked together to start a small business, to provide for their family and to chart their own future. That's the American dream, and Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan understand that. Under President Obama, 23 million Americans are struggling for work. Hispanic unemployment has risen to over 10 percent; African-American unemployment is over 14 percent. This is tragic.</title></item><item><title>And here I want to say something especially to the Democrats who are listening tonight. You can send a wake-up message to your party--the party that was once proud to be the party of working people. Obama's policies have failed. Jobs don't come from government; they come from entrepreneurs and small businesses. Two thirds of all new jobs come from small business, and 2.3 million Hispanics own small businesses and yet this Administration has imposed higher taxes and crushing regulations on small businesses across our nation. To restore America, to get Americans back to work, we must rein in the leviathan. We must stop spending money we don't have and turn around our crushing debt. Each of you comprises the fabric of our nation. Together, we must revive our many-century love story with liberty and restore that shining City on a Hill that is America. I'd like to close with asking you a few questions, with apologies to Barack Obama. Can we restore the Constitution? Yes we can. Can we retake the U.S. Senate? Can we repeal ObamaCare? And can we defeat President Barack Obama? That, my friends, is change we can believe in. Thank you, and God bless America. </title></item></channel></rss>

I am proud to represent Arkansas's Second Congressional District. I am fighting to change Washington at its core because I know we can do better. Record unemployment. Record debt. And $716 billion raided from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare. We can do better. In Little Rock, we have a company with over 500 miles of pipe ready for the Keystone pipeline ­ but that pipe is sitting in a stack, because President Obama says "you can't build that." We can do better. We can't afford to rehire someone with a bankrupt vision and a failed plan. This moment in history is too big. The security of our children and grandchildren is too important. Like a man who is lost but won't ask for directions, President Obama has no earthly idea how to solve this country's problems, yet he beams with confidence in his uncertainty. And who's his navigator? Joe Biden? Folks, we know we can do better. When I look at my daughter Mary Katherine and my son Baby John, I have no choice but to be optimistic about the future of our great country.</title></item><item><title>I don't want us to waste this opportunity to replace small, rudderless confusion with bold, purposeful leadership. Let's do better. Let's elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan and send Barack Obama and Joe Biden on a permanent vacation.

And I am so proud to support the next President of the United States, Governor Mitt Romney! You see, as a poor kid growing up in a single parent household in North Charleston, South Carolina, I felt like I didn't have much going for me. But I did have a couple of things. A mom who believed in tough love. And that love comes at the end of a switch. And my momma loved me a lot! And a small business owner who was my mentor. And taught me that I could "think my way out of poverty." He taught me that having a job is a good thing but creating jobs was even better. Mitt Romney embodies the same vision for America that my mentor had for me. He believes that the path forward is more important than the place where we begin. And let me close by giving President Obama a heartfelt message from the good people of South Carolina: Hit the road, Jack! And don't you come back no more, no more, no more! Thank you. </title></item></channel></rss>
