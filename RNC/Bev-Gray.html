August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Bev Gray (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012Thank you, Governor. Imagine, working every day for four years without a paycheck. I did. I worked while our children, Jessica and Kevin, played and napped. And after I tucked them into bed, I worked. Our first nine months, we had one client -- a client who waited six months to pay us. We sustained our business by tapping into our personal credit cards and borrowing against our home. The commitments, expenses and the stress kept us up at night, but we were determined to build a successful business. And after several years of hard work, long hours, no pay and low pay, we did. Today, Exhibit Edge employs 20 people and helps businesses grow through trade show marketing. When those businesses grow, they employ people. The President said that business owners didn't get there on our own. Well, he's wrong. We risked everything and succeeded because of our hard work and commitment. What President Obama doesn't understand is that when businesses grow, unemployment goes down and people thrive. We need a president who understands the value of entrepreneurship.Governor Romney knows and, more importantly, appreciates what it takes to build a successful business, and that's why I'm supporting Mitt Romney. ### Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
