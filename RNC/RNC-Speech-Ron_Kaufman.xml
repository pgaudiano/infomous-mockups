One of the folks that Mitt Romney brought in to help save the Salt Lake Olympics told me, "Every day on the way to work, you would say to yourself ­ that you owed it to Mitt to be better today than you were yesterday!" If ever there was a time that Americans need to be inspired to be better today than yesterday, that time is now. If ever there was a time that we needed someone to inspire us to do great things, that time is now! Today we come together as a party to nominate for president a man who will energize and inspire this country. The time has come for a new day in America. One with more freedom, one filled with more opportunities and jobs, and a lot less debt. That time and that man have met! That moment is now. That man is Mitt Romney!</title></item><item><title>I have the incredible honor of seconding the nomination for Mitt Romney as the next President of the United States! </title></item></channel></rss>
