August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888The Honorable Marsha Blackburn U.S. Representative ­ Tennessee's Seventh District and Co-Chair, Committee on Resolutions (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 Co-chairing your platform committee has been a great honor. It's also been a lot of work ­ and a lot of fun. You can be so proud of the members of your state delegations. They were smart, conscientious, and opinionated in the best way. They knew what they and you believed, and weren't afraid to say so. And neither were the thousands of American people who responded to our call and through social media offered us their solutions to the challenges that face our country. It has been a remarkable exercise in grassroots democracy and, from this day forward, the GOP will be known as the Great Opportunity Party. If you want to know how our economy can create the millions of jobs we need in order to get America back to work; If you want to know how we're going to get the unlimited energy we need to power our economy so that this really will be an American century; If you're alarmed by our country's declining position in the world, and wondering what can be done to reverse it; Read this platform. Read it to learn how, together, we can assure a quality education for every child, regardless of where they live or what their family income might be.Read it to discover how the American people can replace Obamacare with patient-centered, quality healthcare. Read it to learn about the Republican Party's commitment to true federalism -- where the states take the lead in providing smaller, smarter and more efficient government. If you want to know how Republicans ­ Republicans like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan ­ are going to get America back on track, and back into the black, go online and read this platform. And you will find that where we stand is right with you, with every American who wants a better future for their children, a more secure future for the elderly and a renewed promise of the American dream. Thank you. ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
