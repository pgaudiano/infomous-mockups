August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Tampa, Fla. ­ The following are the remarks as prepared for delivery by congressional candidate David Rouzer. The actual remarks may differ. David Rouzer Republican Candidate for Congress, Seventh District of North Carolina (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 Hello North Carolina, hello America. You can feel it: Our country is at a crossroads. This election will determine whether we continue on the path of more spending, more debt and economic disaster - or whether we choose real solutions and return to the basic principles of free enterprise and limited government. At this critical hour in our nation's history, we can't afford to re-elect Barack Obama - a man who believes that America is the problem. We can't afford to re-elect a man who doesn't understand that it was the hard work and achievement of the American people that made this country great. We can't afford to re-elect someone who believes that our dismal economy is doing just fine! And in North Carolina's 7th Congressional district, we can't afford to re-elect Mike McIntyre ­ a man who voted four times to make Nancy Pelosi the Speaker, and then voted with her more than 90 percent of the time - 90 percent of the time - while she controlled the House. We can't afford to re-elect a man like Mike McIntyre who said about Obama's failed stimulus, "in our part of the country ­ it has worked." Ladies and gentlemen, let's send Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and their lieutenant Mike McIntyre home and restore America to greatness! Elect Romney-Ryan and Rouzer on November 6!May God bless you and may God bless America. ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee  </pre>
