I am honored to be with you today. In these few months leading up to the election, all eyes are on rallying Republicans here at home. But Republicans living and working abroad also play a critical role in electing and supporting our candidates--through voting and fundraising. As global chair of Republicans Abroad, I live in Singapore and work with chapters in over 50 countries around the world. Our job is to encourage American citizens to register and vote Republican. With over six million Americans living overseas, it is often a challenge to convince overseas voters that their vote matters. But consider the 2000 election; it was the overseas voters from right here in Florida that determined the outcome of that election. And Senator Connie Mack often credits the success of his first election to Republicans abroad. So, please remind your friends and family living abroad that their civic duty does not end at the water's edge. Their vote matters and every vote counts--those cast here or abroad. So, Republicans here and abroad let's come together to elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.</title></item><item><title>Thank you and God bless. </title></item></channel></rss>
