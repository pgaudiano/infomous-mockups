Hello delegates! I am a proud member of the Party of Reagan, Romney and Ryan. As a father of six, my biggest worry is that our children are losing their shot at the American Dream. Today, record unemployment is dashing the dreams of our college graduates: instead of moving onto their dream jobs, they're moving into their parents' basement. The debt we're passing off to our kids is a shameful legacy. And Obama's big government policies have made this the worst recovery since the Great Depression. This is not a liberal problem. It's not a conservative problem. This economy is America's problem! Obama's quest to spread the wealth has only managed to spread the misery. We have a better idea. Let's spread the economic growth! And we will spread it from the breweries of Wisconsin to the barrios of California. If you voted for Obama and you have buyer's remorse, let me tell you, Mitt Romney is the hope and Paul Ryan is the change.</title></item><item><title>A vote for Romney / Ryan is a vote for a dream ticket -- a dream ticket that will end the Obama economic nightmare. It is a vote for fiscal sanity and responsibility to Washington. And it is a vote to put AMERICA back to work! Let's get it done! </title></item></channel></rss>
