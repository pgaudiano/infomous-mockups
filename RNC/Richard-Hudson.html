August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Richard Hudson Republican Candidate for Congress, Eighth District of North Carolina (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 I'm Richard Hudson, running for Congress in North Carolina. In NC we tell the truth. The truth is you can't support open-ended bailouts and giveaways if you want to create jobs. You can't support Obamacare and say you're saving Medicare. And you cannot support Barack Obama if you want to stop the spending, stop the waste and stop the assault on our values. This election is about real people ­ people who are suffering under the policies of President Obama and his friends like Larry Kissell. It's about the woman in Thomasville who told me she has to support two men at home ­ her husband who was laid off and her recent college graduate son who can't find a job. And it's about the home builder in Monroe who will take any kind of work just to avoid laying off any more employees. The people of NC are suffering under President Obama. It's not just time for a change ­ it's time for the great American comeback! I give you my word, I will fight every day for what's right. Because it's not about politics, it's about people. It's about our future. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are right for America.Obama and Biden are just wrong! Thank you. God bless you. God bless America. ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
