And times are bad under Barack Obama and his leadership. The labor force participation is at its lowest level in 30 years. Twenty-three million Americans are unemployed, underemployed, or have stopped looking for work. And quite simply, the jobs just aren't there. Household incomes have fallen and their debt has risen. We're paying more for healthcare and getting less choice. There's a war on young people, a war on paychecks and a war on our ability to succeed. We're working to build our own businesses, struggling to pave our own way, only to learn that, according to this president, we didn't build it. But there is hope -- for the change of a new day. Governor Mitt Romney has a plan to get this country back on track and the Young Republicans are excited. We're ready for the government to get out of the way so job creators can actually create jobs. We're ready for leadership that leads from the front. We're ready for change. We're ready to elect Governor Mitt Romney.</title></item><item><title></title></item></channel></rss>
