August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Mark Meadows Republican Candidate for Congress, 11th District, North Carolina (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 You are here and I am here because we indeed do believe in America! We are at a crossroads; we have a choice to make. We have a President who wants his party to make us all dependent on government. We need leaders who believe in the prosperity that the free market brings. We have a President who tramples our first amendment right to religious liberty by requiring all taxpayers to fund abortions. We need public servants who respect life and our religious freedom. We have a President all-too-willing to lead from behind. We need a White House that will unflinchingly support our strongest ally, Israel. We need a President who believes in America. We have a nation too precious to give up on. We have a history too glorious to be forgotten. We have a Constitution too noble to be rewritten. We have a God who reigns over the affairs of nations. And we have a people who, once again, are ready to stand up as "We the People" and choose for themselves the direction of their beloved country. I'm Mark Meadows and I'm running for Congress. With Mitt Romney, we're ready to take our country back.###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
