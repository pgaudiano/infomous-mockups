In 1984, as a young delegate from the great state of Montana, I cast my vote for President Ronald Reagan in Dallas. For the past 28 years, I have built businesses and created hundreds of jobs. My wife Cindy and I have been married for 25 years and are the parents of four great kids. Now, out-of-control spending, crushing debt, and job-destroying regulations threaten our children's future. We have more government than ever before. Our economy is stagnant, families are struggling, and the America we love is threatened. Washington does NOT create jobs, the people do. I'm grateful that six generations of my family have called Montana home. My great-great grandmother left Norway and came to Montana in search of a better future. As a widow with seven children, she homesteaded on the plains of northern Montana. On her tombstone are three simple words: "Saved by Grace." The words "Saved by Government" would never have crossed her mind. She put her faith in God not Government. In 70 days, our country faces a pivotal election -- and our choice is clear. We can do better and we will do better when we elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.</title></item><item><title>Thank you and God bless. </title></item></channel></rss>
