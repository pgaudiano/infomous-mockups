August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Barbara Comstock Member of the Virginia House of Delegates and Deputy Permanent Co-chair of the Convention (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 Greetings from Virginia, where the American story began. What started with entrepreneurs arriving in Jamestown in 1607 ­ and grew with the wisdom of Washington, Jefferson, Madison ­ shaped a nation and the world. Lovers of freedom and liberty, members of all races and religions ­ from across the globe ­ now live and prosper in Virginia, which is rated one of the best places to live, work, start a business, and raise a family. Over the past four years, we in Virginia have kept the American Dream alive by observing the President's policies ­ and DOING THE OPPOSITE. If reelected, President Obama would double down on his job-destroying policies: ·He promises to raise our taxes and hurt working families. ·He mocks our right-to-work laws. ·His budget failure threatens to slash 200,000 national security and high-tech jobs in Virginia. ·His war on success undermines individual initiative and innovation. Obama isn't working. President Mitt Romney and Vice President Paul Ryan WILL. They have a common-sense plan to reward and unleash our entrepreneurs and innovators and put America back to work. They will be unapologetic in championing the American Dream. In 70 days, let's renew our Founding Fathers' victory for freedom.Let's guarantee that our children and their children continue this American story of freedom, opportunity and prosperity for all. ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
