And I am so proud to support the next President of the United States, Governor Mitt Romney! You see, as a poor kid growing up in a single parent household in North Charleston, South Carolina, I felt like I didn't have much going for me. But I did have a couple of things. A mom who believed in tough love. And that love comes at the end of a switch. And my momma loved me a lot! And a small business owner who was my mentor. And taught me that I could "think my way out of poverty." He taught me that having a job is a good thing but creating jobs was even better. Mitt Romney embodies the same vision for America that my mentor had for me. He believes that the path forward is more important than the place where we begin. And let me close by giving President Obama a heartfelt message from the good people of South Carolina: Hit the road, Jack! And don't you come back no more, no more, no more! Thank you. </title></item></channel></rss>
