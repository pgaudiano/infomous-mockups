The Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers U.S. Representative, Washington, Fifth District (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 29, 2012 Good evening. While we gather here tonight for the second night of the GOP Convention in Tampa, we'd like to pause to acknowledge those along the Gulf Coast impacted by Hurricane Isaac. While it's now been downgraded to a tropical storm, our hearts and our prayers remain with them. And we pledge to help them recover and rebuild. To find out more about how you can help those affected by Hurricane Isaac, please visit: www.RedCross.Org\give. Tonight we have a terrific line-up for you. Our theme tonight is, "We can change it." We have heard of the challenges America is facing; now let's talk about the solutions. Those of you here in the convention, and those of you watching at home, know what needs to be done: --We need to create more jobs and get our economy moving again. --We need to make college affordable and within the reach of every child. I was the first in my family to graduate from college, so I know how important that is to the American Dream. --We need a government that works for us, not against us, and lives within its means (just like you and I do). --We also need a president who shares these ideas and values.

Our current president has a different philosophy. For every problem, he has the same solution: more taxes, more spending and more government. We know how those policies have turned out: more unemployment, more poverty, and more debt. Friends, we know we can do better ­ we can change it. And tonight's program is filled with people who will tell us how. Senator John Thune will talk to us about how small businesses ­ like the one I ran with my family in Washington state ­ are the fuel our economy needs. Senator Rob Portman will talk to us about the vital role of international trade in jump-starting our economy. Governor Tim Pawlenty will share with us why he believes Mitt Romney is the man who can get the job done. We're so pleased that Mike Huckabee will be with us. We look forward to hearing his candid assessments as one of America's favorite former governors. And former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will talk about America's role on the world stage ­ and how our current economic situation impacts our ability to lead. New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez will talk about how she became the first female Hispanic governor in American history ­ and how she hopes to break down barriers for other young women. And finally, our keynote speaker is a man with the courage of his convictions, who is not afraid to tackle the tough questions facing our country, the next vice president of the United States, Paul Ryan. So let's start by talking about one of the first things that will change under Mitt Romney ­ Obamacare. Join me in welcoming Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens. ###
