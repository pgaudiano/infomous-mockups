As Grant and I juggled school, jobs, church and family, we grew to love the Romneys.</p><p><a name="8"/>They became role-models and friends, and we were honored when Mitt and Ann regularly trusted us to stay with their five rambunctious - but very loving - sons when they traveled.</p><p><a name="9"/>It was when our daughter Kate was born three and a half months early that I fully came to appreciate what a great treasure of friendship we had in Mitt and Ann.</p><p><a name="10"/>Kate was so tiny and very sick.</p><p><a name="11"/>Her lungs not yet ready to breathe, her heart unstable, and after suffering a severe brain hemorrhage at three days old, she was teetering on the very edge of life.</p><p><a name="12"/>As I sat with her in intensive care, consumed with a mother's worry and fear, dear Mitt came to visit and pray with me.</p><p><a name="13"/>.</p><p><a name="14"/>As our clergy, he was one of few visitors allowed.</p><p><a name="15"/>I will never forget that when he looked down tenderly at my daughter, his eyes filled with tears, and he reached out gently and stroked her tiny back.</p><p><a name="16"/>I could tell immediately that he didn't just see a tangle of plastic and tubes; he saw our beautiful little girl, and he was clearly overcome with compassion for her.</p><p><a name="17"/>During the many months Kate was hospitalized, the Romneys often cared for our two-year old son, Peter.</p><p><a name="18"/>They treated him like one of their own, even welcoming him to stay the night when needed.</p><p><a name="19"/>When Thanksgiving rolled around, Kate was still struggling for life.</p><p><a name="20"/>Brain surgery was scheduled, and the holiday was the furthest thing from our minds.</p><p><a name="21"/>I opened my door to find Mitt and his boys, arms loaded with a Thanksgiving feast.</p><p><a name="22"/>Of course we were overcome.</p><p><a name="23"/>When I called to thank Ann, she sweetly confessed it had been Mitt's idea, that most of the cooking and chopping had been done by him.</p><p><a name="24"/>She and the boys had just happily pitched in.</p><p><a name="25"/>Eventually we moved from Boston.</p><p><a name="26"/>Our daughter Kate grew into an amazing girl of faith and love.</p><p><a name="27"/>But complications of her birth remained with her, and after 26 years of both miracles and struggle, she passed away just a year and a half ago.</p><p><a name="28"/>In the midst of making the final decision to run for President - which had to be the most difficult of their lives - when they heard of Kate's passing, both Mitt and Ann paused, to personally reach out to extend us sympathy, and express their love.</p><p><a name="29"/>It seems to me when it comes to loving our neighbor, we can talk about it, or we can live it.</p><p><a name="30"/>The Romney's live it every single day.</p><p><a name="31"/>When the world looks at Mitt Romney, they see him as the founder of a successful business, the leader of the Olympics, or a Governor.</p><p><a name="32"/>When I see Mitt, I know him to be a loving father, man of faith and caring and compassionate friend.</p><p><a name="33"/>It is with great excitement and a renewed hope, to know that our country will be blessed as it is led by a man who is not only so accomplished and capable, but who has devoted his entire life quietly serving others.</p><p><a name="34"/>.</p><p><a name="35"/>That man is Mitt Romney..</p></body></html>
