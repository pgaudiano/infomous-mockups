But first I would like to offer our thoughts and prayers for the safety of all those in the pathway of the hurricane.</p><p><a name="3"/>On behalf of our party, let me extend our sincere gratitude to the people of Tampa.</p><p><a name="4"/>We're just thrilled to be here--and humbled by your hospitality.</p><p><a name="5"/>Thanks to the tireless work of our convention staff and volunteers, this will be an inspiring three days--a convention truly worthy of the next President of the United States.</p><p><a name="6"/>From this stage, we'll hear from some of our party's most inspiring leaders.</p><p><a name="7"/>With us and with the entire country, they will share their stories and our vision for a better future.</p><p><a name="8"/>We have a message for America: Elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, and they will get this country working again.</p><p><a name="9"/>We will restore the idea that every person in America can live the American Dream.</p><p><a name="10"/>We embrace success, and we want everyone to be successful.</p><p><a name="11"/>As we gather here, the nation we love is a country in turmoil.</p><p><a name="12"/>Twenty-three million of our fellow Americans are struggling for work.</p><p><a name="13"/>Families are hurting.</p><p><a name="14"/>Wages are shrinking.</p><p><a name="15"/>The debt is rising.</p><p><a name="16"/>And just to make sure no one forgets that, we've installed two big debt clocks to remind America of Obama's fiscal recklessness.</p><p><a name="17"/>We've seen what Obama and Biden offer.</p><p><a name="18"/>It looks nothing like hope or change.</p><p><a name="19"/>Give them another term, and we'll just get four more years of failure.</p><p><a name="20"/>.</p><p><a name="21"/>But with Mitt Romney's experience and Paul Ryan's expertise, we can expect great things from a Romney-Ryan administration.</p><p><a name="22"/>We must send America's comeback team to Washington, so the middle class can thrive--and wages can rise--and our children can succeed once again.</p><p><a name="23"/>Republicans believe American greatness comes from the American people--not from the federal government.</p><p><a name="24"/>But Barack Obama thinks the government is at the center of the economic universe.</p><p><a name="25"/>He thinks that if you started a business, "You didn't build that." Well, how would he know? President Obama's never run a company.</p><p><a name="26"/>He hasn't even run a garage sale or seen the inside of a lemonade stand.</p><p><a name="27"/>So it's time for a President with real experience in the real economy.</p><p><a name="28"/>Mitt Romney will be that President.</p><p><a name="29"/>Barack Obama and his party may be satisfied with attacking the American Dream.</p><p><a name="30"/>But Republicans won't be satisfied until we've rebuilt the American Dream.</p><p><a name="31"/>We will fight for a future where government spends tax dollars wisely.</p><p><a name="32"/>Where every American has the education needed to succeed.</p><p><a name="33"/>Where energy is affordable because America is energy independent, and where the middle class is growing because incomes are rising.</p><p><a name="34"/>We invite all Americans who believe our children deserve this better future to join with us.</p><p><a name="35"/>A victory for the Romney-Ryan ticket is not merely a Republican victory.</p><p><a name="36"/>It is a victory for America.</p><p><a name="37"/>So welcome to Tampa, to our convention, and to the beginning of a better future.</p><p><a name="38"/>Thank you and God Bless you.</p><p><a name="39"/>Let's have a great week..</p></body></html>
