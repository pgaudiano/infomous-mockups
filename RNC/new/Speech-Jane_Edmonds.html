He is unquestionably an amazing steward and leader, a servant leader and someone whom I respect very much.</p><p><a name="21"/>That's the kind of leadership that has always inspired me.</p><p><a name="22"/>Unselfish leadership! The late Stephen Covey writes about 2 kinds of people: one type is all about themselves and their success.</p><p><a name="23"/>The other type works as hard as they can - and certainly succeeds, but their success is motivated by doing good for others.</p><p><a name="24"/>That's how I see Governor Romney.</p><p><a name="25"/>He is authentic.</p><p><a name="26"/>He is open to good ideas wherever they come from.</p><p><a name="27"/>It doesn't matter if they are from a liberal Democrat like me.</p><p><a name="28"/>He'll listen and he's inclusive.</p><p><a name="29"/>As a great leader, he brought out the best in me and I know, as President, he will bring out the best in our country! Thank you..</p></body></html>
