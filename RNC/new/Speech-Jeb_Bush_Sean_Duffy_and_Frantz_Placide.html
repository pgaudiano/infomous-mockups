Bienvenido a Florida! This election is about the future of this nation.</p><p><a name="2"/>We can shape that future with what we do here, with what we do November 6.</p><p><a name="3"/>We can restore America's greatness.</p><p><a name="4"/>That starts with a strong economy, a smart energy policy, lower deficits, and a president who puts America's workers and job-creators first.</p><p><a name="5"/>But to have a great future - a secure future - a future that is equal to our potential as a nation, we need to do something else.</p><p><a name="6"/>We must make sure that our children and grandchildren are ready for the world we are shaping today.</p><p><a name="7"/>It starts in our homes, in our communities, and especially in our schools.</p><p><a name="8"/>As a candidate and Governor, I visited over 400 schools.</p><p><a name="9"/>I saw children read their first sentences.</p><p><a name="10"/>Solve their first long-division problems.</p><p><a name="11"/>Explore the miracles of chemistry and physics.</p><p><a name="12"/>That's the essence of education - students getting a chance at a future.</p><p><a name="13"/>There are many reasons to believe America's future is bright, but also reasons to worry.</p><p><a name="14"/>Of 34 advanced nations in the world, American students rank 17th in science, 25th in math.</p><p><a name="15"/>.</p><p><a name="16"/>Only one-fourth of high school graduates are ready for their next steps.</p><p><a name="17"/>China and India produce eight times more engineering students each year than the United States.</p><p><a name="18"/>There is a moral cost to our failing schools.</p><p><a name="19"/>We say that every child in America has an equal opportunity.</p><p><a name="20"/>Tell that to a kid in whose classroom learning isn't respected.</p><p><a name="21"/>Tell that to a parent stuck in a school where there is no leadership.</p><p><a name="22"/>Tell that to a young, talented teacher who just got laid off because she didn't have tenure.</p><p><a name="23"/>The sad truth is that equality of opportunity doesn't exist in many of our schools.</p><p><a name="24"/>We give some kids a chance, but not all.</p><p><a name="25"/>That failure is the great moral and economic issue of our time.</p><p><a name="26"/>And it's hurting all of America.</p><p><a name="27"/>I believe we can meet this challenge.</p><p><a name="28"/>We need to set high standards for students and teachers and provide students and their parents the choices they deserve.</p><p><a name="29"/>The first step is a simple one.</p><p><a name="30"/>We must stop pre-judging children based on their race, ethnicity or household income.</p><p><a name="31"/>We must stop excusing failure in our schools and start rewarding improvement and success.</p><p><a name="32"/>We must have high academic standards that are benchmarked to the best in the world.</p><p><a name="33"/>All kids can learn.</p><p><a name="34"/>Governor Romney believes it, and the data proves it.</p><p><a name="35"/>While he was governor, Massachusetts raised standards and today their students lead the nation in academic performance.</p><p><a name="36"/>Here in Florida in 1999, we were at the bottom of the nation in education.</p><p><a name="37"/>For the last decade, this state has been on a path of reform.</p><p><a name="38"/>Under the leadership of Governor Rick Scott and local leaders, our focus every day is whether students are learning.</p><p><a name="39"/>That's it.</p><p><a name="40"/>Today, more students are reading on grade level, passing rigorous college prep courses and graduating from high school.</p><p><a name="41"/>And perhaps most exciting, those traditionally left behind are showing the greatest gains.</p><p><a name="42"/>Among African-American students, Florida is ranked fourth in the nation for academic improvement.</p><p><a name="43"/>.</p><p><a name="44"/>Among low-income students, we're ranked third for our gains.</p><p><a name="45"/>Among students with disabilities, we're ranked first.</p><p><a name="46"/>And among Latino students, the gains were so big, they required a new metric.</p><p><a name="47"/>Right now, Florida's fourth grade Hispanic students read as well or better than the average of all students in 21 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p><a name="48"/>These kids were once written off.</p><p><a name="49"/>But today thanks to teachers like Sean Duffy we're changing that.</p><p><a name="50"/>I'm honored to be an educator, to help the next generation of leaders, thinkers, builders, and entrepreneurs.</p><p><a name="51"/>Sadly, I'm part of a dwindling field.</p><p><a name="52"/>I've seen too many good teachers come and go, mainly due to poor working conditions and little pay.</p><p><a name="53"/>Bad teachers get locked into the system and good teachers leave for more money.</p><p><a name="54"/>On top of the bureaucratic challenges, what we're teaching doesn't always match what our students need.</p><p><a name="55"/>To that end, I launched a STEM lab at my high school.</p><p><a name="56"/>These labs focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics and help students learn proficiency in these fields.</p><p><a name="57"/>We turn students away from education each year by not providing a robust curriculum that keeps up with the world in which these students live - and will eventually work.</p><p><a name="58"/>And at the end of the day, all of what we do from the educators to the policy makers has to be student-focused and student-centered.</p><p><a name="59"/>Students matter most.</p><p><a name="60"/>Thanks, Sean.</p><p><a name="61"/>I know Del Valle High School is proud of your efforts.</p><p><a name="62"/>We need more great teachers like you.</p><p><a name="63"/>Teachers who don't give up on a kid, who recognize that every child can learn, and don't waste a precious year of a student's life.</p><p><a name="64"/>If you're a great teacher and your students are mastering their subjects, no matter your age or years of experience, you should have a job.</p><p><a name="65"/>Education is hard work, but if you follow some core principles, and you challenge the status quo, you get great results.</p><p><a name="66"/>.</p><p><a name="67"/>So here's another thing we can do: Let's give every parent in America a choice about where their child attends school.</p><p><a name="68"/>Everywhere in our lives, we get the chance to choose.</p><p><a name="69"/>Go down any supermarket aisle - you'll find an incredible selection of milk.</p><p><a name="70"/>You can get whole milk, 2% milk, low-fat milk or skim milk.</p><p><a name="71"/>Organic milk, and milk with extra Vitamin D.</p><p><a name="72"/>There's flavored milk-- chocolate, strawberry or vanilla - and it doesn't even taste like milk.</p><p><a name="73"/>They even make milk for people who can't drink milk.</p><p><a name="74"/>Shouldn't parents have that kind of choice in schools? Governor Romney gets it.</p><p><a name="75"/>He believes parents - regardless of zip code or income - should be able to send their child to the school that fits them best.</p><p><a name="76"/>That has set him against some entrenched interests.</p><p><a name="77"/>There are many people who say they support strong schools but draw the line at school choice.</p><p><a name="78"/>"Sorry, kid.</p><p><a name="79"/>Giving you equal opportunity would be too risky.</p><p><a name="80"/>And it will upset powerful political forces that we need to win elections." I have a simple message for these masters of delay and deferral: Choose.</p><p><a name="81"/>You can either help the politically powerful unions.</p><p><a name="82"/>Or you can help the kids.</p><p><a name="83"/>Now, I know it's hard to take on the unions.</p><p><a name="84"/>They fund campaigns.</p><p><a name="85"/>They're well-organized.</p><p><a name="86"/>Election day? They'll show up.</p><p><a name="87"/>Meanwhile, the kids aren't old enough to vote.</p><p><a name="88"/>But you and I know who deserves a choice.</p><p><a name="89"/>Governor Romney knows it, too.</p><p><a name="90"/>Let me introduce you to Frantz Placide.</p><p><a name="91"/>Because we gave him a choice, he got a great education.</p><p><a name="92"/>I grew up in the inner city of Miami.</p><p><a name="93"/>In a place where your zip code determined your chances of success, my only option was an unproductive and failing school.</p><p><a name="94"/>I knew that could lead to an unproductive and failing future.</p><p><a name="95"/>Thanks to Governor Bush's school choice program, I got the chance to choose a better school.</p><p><a name="96"/>.</p><p><a name="97"/>Making my education my priority, I enrolled at one of the toughest private schools in Miami Archbishop Curley Notre Dame.</p><p><a name="98"/>I'm sure like a lot of us, it was my mother, Carlette, who really pushed for a choice in my education.</p><p><a name="99"/>I'm glad she did.</p><p><a name="100"/>Her devotion to my future has given me a chance to succeed.</p><p><a name="101"/>I've graduated from Wagner College, and am looking forward to a life of learning, and serving my community.</p><p><a name="102"/>Who knows what the future would have held, if there hadn't been a choice in my education? But I do know the numbers for failure, and I probably wouldn't have had a very good chance.</p><p><a name="103"/>Governor Bush's school choice program gave me the chance to achieve academic success, in the school that was the best fit for me.</p><p><a name="104"/>I took it from there.</p><p><a name="105"/>Thank you Frantz, it's been an honor to see you grow up.</p><p><a name="106"/>Your story is driving powerful change across this nation.</p><p><a name="107"/>And some of the biggest reformers are Republicans.</p><p><a name="108"/>Governor Mitch Daniels in Indiana and Governor Jindal in Louisiana have expanded school choice beyond what we have in Florida.</p><p><a name="109"/>Governor Martinez in New Mexico is raising expectations - holding schools accountable for students gaining critical reading skills.</p><p><a name="110"/>Governor LePage in Maine and Deal in Georgia are transforming education by pushing schools to harness the power of technology and digital learning.</p><p><a name="111"/>Idaho's Governor Otter and Superintendent Luna are raising up the best teachers and separating out the ineffective ones.</p><p><a name="112"/>That earned some enemies.</p><p><a name="113"/>Some of them slashed the superintendent's tires.</p><p><a name="114"/>But he didn't back down.</p><p><a name="115"/>Governor Walker in Wisconsin led his state to adopt reforms that promote early literacy and require that teacher evaluations incorporate student achievement.</p><p><a name="116"/>In Nevada, Governor Sandoval pushed for reforms to end the damaging practice of "last in, first out" - where teachers are hired or fired based on their years in the system, not on their impact in the classroom.</p><p><a name="117"/>Governor Haslam in Tennessee is making sure every classroom has an effective teacher.</p><p><a name="118"/>.</p><p><a name="119"/>Because he is a former governor, Mitt Romney understands that states must lead this national movement.</p><p><a name="120"/>In Massachusetts, Governor Romney narrowed the gap between students of different races, raised testing standards, and put into place a merit scholarship, the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship that gives students four tuition free years, at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.</p><p><a name="121"/>He's a champion for bringing hope to education.</p><p><a name="122"/>And he intends to be a champion for equality of opportunity, a president who always puts students first.</p><p><a name="123"/>So in this election, remember this: Our future as a nation is at stake.</p><p><a name="124"/>Fact is, this election is not about just one office.</p><p><a name="125"/>It is about one nation.</p><p><a name="126"/>If we want to continue to be the greatest nation on the planet, we must give our kids what we promise them: An equal opportunity.</p><p><a name="127"/>That starts in the classroom.</p><p><a name="128"/>It starts in our communities.</p><p><a name="129"/>It starts where you live.</p><p><a name="130"/>And it starts with electing Mitt Romney the next President of the United States.</p><p><a name="131"/>Thank you.</p><p><a name="132"/>God bless you, God bless our excellent teachers and God bless the United States of America..</p></body></html>
