And this November, we cannot settle for anything less.</p><p><a name="31"/>This is the most critical election of our lifetime.</p><p><a name="32"/>Each of us must do our part now to ensure that America remains, in the tradition of President Reagan, a land of freedom, hope and opportunity.</p><p><a name="33"/>Thank you and God bless..</p></body></html>
