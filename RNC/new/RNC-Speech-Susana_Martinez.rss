I fear some of our leaders today have lost the courage to stand up</title></item><item><title>What we have now are politicians</title></item><item><title>They won't offer real plans, and only stand up when they want to blame someone else</title></item><item><title>And I don't say that just because a Democrat is in the White House</title></item><item><title>I was a Democrat for many years</title></item><item><title>So were my parents</title></item><item><title>Before I ran for District Attorney, two Republicans invited my husband and me to lunch</title></item><item><title>And I knew a party-switch was exactly what they wanted</title></item><item><title>So, I told Chuck, we'll be polite, enjoy a free lunch and then say goodbye</title></item><item><title>But we talked about issues--they never used the words Republican, or Democrat, conservative or liberal</title></item><item><title>We talked about many issues, like welfare - is it a way of life, or a hand-up? Talked about the size of government -- how much should it tax families and small businesses? And when we left that lunch, we got in the car and I looked over at Chuck and said, "I'll be damned, we're Republicans." This election should not be about political parties</title></item><item><title>Too many Americans are out of work, and our debt is out of control</title></item><item><title>This election needs to be about those issues</title></item><item><title>And it is the responsibility of both parties to offer up real solutions and have an honest debate</title></item><item><title>In New Mexico, I inherited the largest structural deficit in state history</title></item><item><title>And our legislature is controlled by Democrats</title></item><item><title>We don't always agree</title></item><item><title>But we came together - in a bi-partisan manner--and turned that deficit into a surplus, all without raising taxes</title></item><item><title>That's not the kind of leadership we are seeing from President Obama</title></item><item><title>He promised to bring us all together, to cut unemployment, to pass immigration reform in his first year and even promised to cut the deficit in half in his first term</title></item><item><title>Do you remember that? But he hasn't come close</title></item><item><title>They haven't even passed a budget in Washington, DC in three years! If he can take credit for government building small businesses, then he can accept responsibility for breaking his promise and adding 5 trillion dollars to the national debt</title></item><item><title>Because he did build that</title></item><item><title>As the first Hispanic female governor in history, little girls often come up to me in the grocery store or the mall</title></item><item><title>They look and point, and when they get the courage, they ask "Are you Susana?" and they run up and give me a hug</title></item><item><title>And I wonder</title></item><item><title>How do you know who I am?
