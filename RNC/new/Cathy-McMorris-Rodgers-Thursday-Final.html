The Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers U.S. Representative, Washington 5th District (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 30, 2012 Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the final evening of the 2012 National Convention. We have had a wonderful few days, hearing the inspiring stories of Republicans from across the country. From some of our party's great leaders like Governor Jeb Bush, who we just heard from, to every day men and women working hard to survive in the Obama economy, they've told us how we can do better. They've reminded us that we built it, and we learned about how under the Romney-Ryan administration we can change it. Of course, tonight is the main event. Tonight we will hear from the next president of the United States, Mitt Romney. And we have chosen him because we believe in America. We believe in an America that doesn't punish success, but celebrates it. An America that encourages hard work and individual responsibility. And we believe in an America where every child has the chance to succeed. Tonight we'll hear from some of the people who know Mitt Romney best. In their words and from their stories we will learn why he is the right man to defeat Barack Obama this November, and restore America to greatness. We'll hear from dear family friends whose lives have been touched by the Romneys' faith and generosity. We'll hear from two former colleagues who worked alongside Mitt when he was Governor of Massachusetts.

You'll hear from the CEO of Staples, a successful company that Mitt Romney helped create and expand during his time at Bain Capital. We're delighted to have a number of former Olympians with us tonight, to remind us of the great comeback that Mitt Romney engineered at the Salt Lake City Olympics. And we are excited that Florida Senator Marco Rubio is here to share his personal story and vision for a future where everyone can still capture the American dream. To get the next portion of our evening started, I would like to welcome to the stage, Grant Bennett, President of CPS Technologies and friend of Mitt Romney.
