Mitt Romney had turned around companies and he had turned around the Olympics.</p><p><a name="4"/>Now Massachusetts needed Mitt Romney to turn us around.</p><p><a name="5"/>Massachusetts was in deep trouble.</p><p><a name="6"/>We had a massive budget gap and soaring unemployment.</p><p><a name="7"/>People in my state were losing hope -- for themselves, their families and their children.</p><p><a name="8"/>Sadly, very much like our country finds itself today.</p><p><a name="9"/>Mitt Romney answered the call of service and accepted the challenge.</p><p><a name="10"/>How did he fix our state? Well, he quickly assembled a cabinet of the best and the brightest, drawing on both parties, Republicans and Democrats, half women, half men, to give him the full spectrum of ideas and advice.</p><p><a name="11"/>He respected different opinions, valued open debate, and when it was all said and done, Mitt Romney knew how to make a decision.</p><p><a name="12"/>Governor Romney did what many thought was impossible.</p><p><a name="13"/>He turned around a $3 billion budget gap and created a $2 billion rainy day fund.</p><p><a name="14"/>.</p><p><a name="15"/>Even as he worked to streamline government, he made certain to safeguard protections for the elderly, children and the homeless.</p><p><a name="16"/>In education, Governor Romney gave parents more choices, insisted on tough standards for both teachers and students, and Massachusetts schools became the best in the nation.</p><p><a name="17"/>We cleared out regulations on small businesses.</p><p><a name="18"/>We cut taxes 19 times.</p><p><a name="19"/>And, as a result, unemployment dropped to only 4.7 percent.</p><p><a name="20"/>And, unlike President Obama, Governor Romney's economic policies were rewarded with a credit upgrade.</p><p><a name="21"/>Those are the facts and figures, but when people find out that I served as Mitt Romney's lieutenant governor, they always ask me the same question: What's he like? First and foremost, Mitt is a good and honorable man, committed to public service and his country.</p><p><a name="22"/>On the morning he took the oath of office, his first act was to focus public attention on those in need.</p><p><a name="23"/>We served breakfast to homeless veterans -- encouraging volunteerism, and acknowledging the special debt we owe to those who sacrifice for our country.</p><p><a name="24"/>Mitt never took a salary as governor.</p><p><a name="25"/>But he worked harder than anyone I know.</p><p><a name="26"/>Early every morning, before the rest of us arrived, Mitt would meet with his economic secretary.</p><p><a name="27"/>They worked tirelessly -- because for Mitt, creating jobs was his top priority.</p><p><a name="28"/>Mitt was always a hands-on leader.</p><p><a name="29"/>When one of Boston's tunnels collapsed, tragically killing a passenger in her car, Mitt didn't blame others.</p><p><a name="30"/>He dove in and fixed the problem.</p><p><a name="31"/>Mitt immersed himself in the engineering challenges, personally oversaw safety inspections, abolished cronyism and corruption, and restored public confidence.</p><p><a name="32"/>That's the Mitt Romney I know.</p><p><a name="33"/>And he is ready to bring that same work ethic, vision and integrity to the White House.</p><p><a name="34"/>He will never let our children's education be second-best or allow their future prosperity to be mortgaged by today's political cowardice.</p><p><a name="35"/>.</p><p><a name="36"/>And he will respect those who build things with their own minds and their own hands.</p><p><a name="37"/>Mitt Romney won't just talk about family values, he will live them.</p><p><a name="38"/>And I'll tell you another thing, Mitt Romney understands that the world is a safer place when our country leads, and he will never apologize for America.</p><p><a name="39"/>He will lead us back to an America we can be proud of -- and ahead to a future where the American dream is alive again, and within every man and woman's reach.</p><p><a name="40"/>Thank you, Mitt Romney, for believing in America.</p><p><a name="41"/>And America, you can believe in Mitt Romney!.</p></body></html>
