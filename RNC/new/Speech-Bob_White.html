Ann had some great stories about Mitt.</p><p><a name="3"/>So do I.</p><p><a name="4"/>For 30 years, I have been at Mitt Romney's side when he did extraordinary things.</p><p><a name="5"/>As Mitt says, I'm his "wingman." I was there when Mitt turned around desperate situations; fixed big, broken things; and had a profoundly positive impact on people's lives.</p><p><a name="6"/>Our journey began when Mitt asked a small group of us to help him start an investment firm called Bain Capital.</p><p><a name="7"/>Mitt was absolutely clear what he expected from each of us.</p><p><a name="8"/>We would act with absolute integrity.</p><p><a name="9"/>Mutual respect.</p><p><a name="10"/>True teammates.</p><p><a name="11"/>And we would recognize the profound responsibility we owed to those who had placed their trust in us.</p><p><a name="12"/>Integrity.</p><p><a name="13"/>Respect.</p><p><a name="14"/>Responsibility.</p><p><a name="15"/>Trust.</p><p><a name="16"/>These are not just words to Mitt Romney.</p><p><a name="17"/>These are principles he lives by.</p><p><a name="18"/>He applied them to the way we worked.</p><p><a name="19"/>First, he built the team.</p><p><a name="20"/>Recruited the best people he could find.</p><p><a name="21"/>Reached out for ideas.</p><p><a name="22"/>Encouraged dissent.</p><p><a name="23"/>Fostered real cooperation.</p><p><a name="24"/>Next, he gave us clarity of purpose.</p><p><a name="25"/>Our investors included pension funds, colleges and charities with noble missions.</p><p><a name="26"/>We would invest wisely and treat their money as carefully as our own.</p><p><a name="27"/>.</p><p><a name="28"/>We would support entrepreneurs and invest in troubled situations.</p><p><a name="29"/>We would help them grow and make their companies better.</p><p><a name="30"/>We would be held accountable for our performance.</p><p><a name="31"/>And when things went wrong, we would not blame others.</p><p><a name="32"/>Finally, he took decisive action.</p><p><a name="33"/>Mitt never hesitated.</p><p><a name="34"/>He made the tough decisions, coalesced the team, and moved forward.</p><p><a name="35"/>Time and time again, I have seen this decisive leadership.</p><p><a name="36"/>When our old consulting firm was on the verge of collapse, they asked Mitt to come back and help.</p><p><a name="37"/>He answered the call.</p><p><a name="38"/>When many thought the situation was hopeless, Mitt was not deterred.</p><p><a name="39"/>I will never forget when he said: "Bob, 1,000 employees and their families depend on us.</p><p><a name="40"/>We can't let them down." When the obstacles seemed insurmountable and others panicked, Mitt was the calm in the storm.</p><p><a name="41"/>He never lost hope.</p><p><a name="42"/>His confidence gave us confidence.</p><p><a name="43"/>That company not only survived, it thrived.</p><p><a name="44"/>Today Bain & Co.</p><p><a name="45"/>is recognized as one of the best places to work in America.</p><p><a name="46"/>I saw something similar when Mitt was asked to help save the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.</p><p><a name="47"/>When we first realized the magnitude of the financial and management challenges, I was skeptical whether they could be saved.</p><p><a name="48"/>But Mitt never doubted what could be done.</p><p><a name="49"/>He applied the same principles of leadership - and the Olympics became a success story that made America proud.</p><p><a name="50"/>And when Mitt was elected governor of Massachusetts, he asked that I help assemble a team that would serve the public trust and be loyal to his principles.</p><p><a name="51"/>The team accomplished so much because they got Republicans and Democrats to focus on the real problems to achieve real results.</p><p><a name="52"/>So why has Mitt taken on so many challenges? .</p><p><a name="53"/>Because he runs toward problems, believes it is important to make a difference, and is determined to always give something back.</p><p><a name="54"/>In every pursuit he feels a sense of responsibility and a commitment to serve.</p><p><a name="55"/>Even though we worked endless hours at Bain Capital, Mitt found time to serve his church and counsel people in need.</p><p><a name="56"/>If someone needed help, Mitt was there.</p><p><a name="57"/>When our partner's daughter went missing in New York, Mitt said, "We can't just stand by and do nothing.</p><p><a name="58"/>We need to go find her." He closed down the entire office, took all of us to New York, and mobilized a search effort.</p><p><a name="59"/>Within days, we found her.</p><p><a name="60"/>And a mom, a dad, and a daughter were reunited.</p><p><a name="61"/>Mitt wanted us to give back too.</p><p><a name="62"/>He inspired the formation of Bain Capital Children's Charity.</p><p><a name="63"/>It not only donated money to worthy children's causes, it got Bain Capital employees actively involved in their communities.</p><p><a name="64"/>Go back and look at every pursuit in Mitt's life.</p><p><a name="65"/>Surrounding him are people who have worked with him over and over again.</p><p><a name="66"/>They trust and respect him.</p><p><a name="67"/>They want to be part of his team.</p><p><a name="68"/>They want to be part of the change.</p><p><a name="69"/>And today we need urgent change in Washington.</p><p><a name="70"/>We need a proven leader with passion and compassion.</p><p><a name="71"/>I've seen Mitt Romney be that leader.</p><p><a name="72"/>He is the right man at the right time to be the next President of these great United States.</p><p><a name="73"/>Thank you!.</p></body></html>
