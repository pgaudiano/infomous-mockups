David also helped us plan his funeral.</p><p><a name="34"/>He wanted to be buried in his Boy Scout uniform.</p><p><a name="35"/>He wanted Mitt to pronounce his eulogy.</p><p><a name="36"/>Mitt was there to honor that request.</p><p><a name="37"/>We will be ever grateful to Mitt for his love and concern..</p></body></html>
