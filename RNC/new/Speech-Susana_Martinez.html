My parents grew that small business--from one 18-year-old guarding a bingo--to more than 125 people in three states.</p><p><a name="19"/>And sure, there was help along the way.</p><p><a name="20"/>But my parents took the risk.</p><p><a name="21"/>They stood up.</p><p><a name="22"/>And you better believe that they built it.</p><p><a name="23"/>My parents also taught me about having the courage to stand for something.</p><p><a name="24"/>So, I went to law school and became a prosecutor.</p><p><a name="25"/>I took on a specialty that very few choose to pursue - I prosecuted child abuse and child homicide cases.</p><p><a name="26"/>Cases that were truly gut-wrenching.</p><p><a name="27"/>But standing up for those kids, being their voice for justice, was the honor of a lifetime.</p><p><a name="28"/>Sometimes you pay a price for standing up.</p><p><a name="29"/>When I was a young prosecutor, I got called to testify against my boss.</p><p><a name="30"/>I could have backed down, but I didn't.</p><p><a name="31"/>I stood up to him.</p><p><a name="32"/>And he fired me for it.</p><p><a name="33"/>So I took him on, ran against him for district attorney and beat him by a landslide! I fear some of our leaders today have lost the courage to stand up.</p><p><a name="34"/>What we have now are politicians.</p><p><a name="35"/>They won't offer real plans, and only stand up when they want to blame someone else.</p><p><a name="36"/>And I don't say that just because a Democrat is in the White House.</p><p><a name="37"/>I was a Democrat for many years.</p><p><a name="38"/>So were my parents.</p><p><a name="39"/>Before I ran for District Attorney, two Republicans invited my husband and me to lunch.</p><p><a name="40"/>And I knew a party-switch was exactly what they wanted.</p><p><a name="41"/>So, I told Chuck, we'll be polite, enjoy a free lunch and then say goodbye.</p><p><a name="42"/>But we talked about issues--they never used the words Republican, or Democrat, conservative or liberal.</p><p><a name="43"/>We talked about many issues, like welfare - is it a way of life, or a hand-up? Talked about the size of government -- how much should it tax families and small businesses? And when we left that lunch, we got in the car and I looked over at Chuck and said, "I'll be damned, we're Republicans." .</p><p><a name="44"/>This election should not be about political parties.</p><p><a name="45"/>Too many Americans are out of work, and our debt is out of control.</p><p><a name="46"/>This election needs to be about those issues.</p><p><a name="47"/>And it is the responsibility of both parties to offer up real solutions and have an honest debate.</p><p><a name="48"/>In New Mexico, I inherited the largest structural deficit in state history.</p><p><a name="49"/>And our legislature is controlled by Democrats.</p><p><a name="50"/>We don't always agree.</p><p><a name="51"/>But we came together - in a bi-partisan manner--and turned that deficit into a surplus, all without raising taxes.</p><p><a name="52"/>That's not the kind of leadership we are seeing from President Obama.</p><p><a name="53"/>He promised to bring us all together, to cut unemployment, to pass immigration reform in his first year and even promised to cut the deficit in half in his first term.</p><p><a name="54"/>Do you remember that? But he hasn't come close.</p><p><a name="55"/>They haven't even passed a budget in Washington, DC in three years! If he can take credit for government building small businesses, then he can accept responsibility for breaking his promise and adding 5 trillion dollars to the national debt.</p><p><a name="56"/>Because he did build that.</p><p><a name="57"/>As the first Hispanic female governor in history, little girls often come up to me in the grocery store or the mall.</p><p><a name="58"/>They look and point, and when they get the courage, they ask "Are you Susana?" and they run up and give me a hug.</p><p><a name="59"/>And I wonder.</p><p><a name="60"/>How do you know who I am? But they do.</p><p><a name="61"/>And these are little girls.</p><p><a name="62"/>It's in moments like these when I'm reminded that we each pave a path.</p><p><a name="63"/>And for me, it's about paving a path for those little girls to follow.</p><p><a name="64"/>No more barriers.</p><p><a name="65"/>In many ways Mitt Romney and I are very different.</p><p><a name="66"/>Different starts in life.</p><p><a name="67"/>Different paths to leadership.</p><p><a name="68"/>Different cultures.</p><p><a name="69"/>.</p><p><a name="70"/>But we've each shared in the promise of America, and we share a core belief that the promise of America must be kept for the next generation.</p><p><a name="71"/>El sueno Americanos es tener exito.</p><p><a name="72"/>It's success.</p><p><a name="73"/>Success is the American Dream.</p><p><a name="74"/>And that success is not something to be ashamed of, or to demonize.</p><p><a name="75"/>There is one candidate in this election who will protect that dream, one leader who will fight hard to keep the promise of America for the next generation.</p><p><a name="76"/>And that's why we must stand up and make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States.</p><p><a name="77"/>Thank you!.</p></body></html>
