Ray Fernandez (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 30, 2012

Thank you. These last few months, we've heard a lot of false information about Bain Capital and private equity. I'm proud to stand here ­ and tell you what I saw ­ when Bain Capital bought the company where I worked. The experience improved my job and it gave me opportunities that I always believed were part of the American dream. In 1996, I became a sales rep at a contact lens business called Wesley Jessen. My sales region was right here in Florida, where my parents emigrated from Cuba when I was 13, a country, where the government owns everything but nothing works. Wesley Jessen had been struggling ­ losing over $50 million a year ­ under the previous owner. Then, Mitt Romney and Bain Capital came in. Bain Capital saw something others didn't see. They invested money in marketing. They brought in a charismatic and dynamic CEO, Kevin Ryan. They did everything to make the company succeed. This is the real Bain Capital, the story the Obama campaign doesn't want you to hear. Because of Bain Capital's attention and management, Wesley Jessen roared back. Workers like me, were inspired by what we saw ­ and our careers thrived. And when the company went public a few years later, I was well rewarded.

With that money, my wife Sylvia, who is a pharmacist, and I started our own business in Hialeah, Florida ­ Vida Pharmacy. None of this would have been possible without Bain Capital's investment. They brought a vision and commitment to a struggling company. As a result, we are doing what we love, serving our community. We are building our future. Stories like this need to be told. My life today is better because of Bain Capital. Mitt Romney helped turn around my company. I can't imagine anyone better prepared to turn around this country. Thank you. ###
