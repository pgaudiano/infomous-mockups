a dull, adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next, a government-planned life, a country where everything is free but us</title></item><item><title>Listen to the way we're spoken to already, as if everyone is stuck in some class or station in life, victims of circumstances beyond our control, with government there to help us cope with our fate</title></item><item><title>It's the exact opposite of everything I learned growing up in Wisconsin, or at college in Ohio</title></item><item><title>When I was waiting tables, washing dishes, or mowing lawns for money, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life</title></item><item><title>I was on my own path, my own journey, an American journey where I could think for myself, decide for myself, define happiness for myself</title></item><item><title>That's what we do in this country</title></item><item><title>That's the American Dream</title></item><item><title>That's freedom, and I'll take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners</title></item><item><title>By themselves, the failures of one administration are not a mandate for a new administration</title></item><item><title>A challenger must stand on his own merits</title></item><item><title>He must be ready and worthy to serve in the office of president</title></item><item><title>We're a full generation apart, Governor Romney and I</title></item><item><title>And, in some ways, we're a little different</title></item><item><title>There are the songs on his iPod, which I've heard on the campaign bus and on many hotel elevators</title></item><item><title>He actually urged me to play some of these songs at campaign rallies</title></item><item><title>I said, I hope it's not a deal-breaker Mitt, but my playlist starts with AC/DC, and ends with Zeppelin</title></item><item><title>A generation apart</title></item><item><title>That makes us different, but not in any of the things that matter</title></item><item><title>Mitt Romney and I both grew up in the heartland, and we know what places like Wisconsin and Michigan look like when times are good, when people are working, when families are doing more than just getting by</title></item><item><title>And we both know it can be that way again</title></item><item><title>We've had very different careers -

that's a good thing</title></item><item><title>Mitt has not only succeeded, but succeeded where others could not</title></item><item><title>He turned around the Olympics at a time when a great institution was collapsing under the weight of bad management, overspending, and corruption -
