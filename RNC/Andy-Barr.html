August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Tampa, Fla. ­ The following are the remarks as prepared for delivery by Andy Barr, candidate for Congress. The actual remarks may differ.Andy Barr Republican Candidate for Congress, Kentucky 6th District (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 Beyond the rolling hills of the Bluegrass, within the depths of steep mountainsides, Kentuckians built a coal industry that powers America. But President Obama doesn't care. Coal provides Kentuckians with some of the lowest electricity costs in America ­ enabling companies like Toyota to create 7,000 jobs in Georgetown, Kentucky. But President Obama doesn't care. This year alone, 2,000 Kentucky miners lost their jobs because of Obama's "War on Coal." For every mining job lost, three additional jobs are threatened, including those at Toyota. But President Obama doesn't care. Rarely in history has a single industry been so ruthlessly attacked with so little regard for the people it hurts. People like Chris Woods, a young coal miner who took me underground to show me his work. Chris considers himself lucky. He still has a job, driving an hour each way, for a 10-hour shift. His paycheck supports his wife, two kids and both sets of parents. Chris looked me in the eyes. I'll never forget his words:"Andy, I don't know much about politics, and frankly I don't care about politics. But if you can save my job, I'm for you." Chris, I care about your job. Mitt Romney cares about your job. And together, we're going to fight to save your job! ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
