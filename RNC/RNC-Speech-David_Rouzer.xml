You can feel it: Our country is at a crossroads. This election will determine whether we continue on the path of more spending, more debt and economic disaster - or whether we choose real solutions and return to the basic principles of free enterprise and limited government. At this critical hour in our nation's history, we can't afford to re-elect Barack Obama - a man who believes that America is the problem. We can't afford to re-elect a man who doesn't understand that it was the hard work and achievement of the American people that made this country great. We can't afford to re-elect someone who believes that our dismal economy is doing just fine! And in North Carolina's 7th Congressional district, we can't afford to re-elect Mike McIntyre ­ a man who voted four times to make Nancy Pelosi the Speaker, and then voted with her more than 90 percent of the time - 90 percent of the time - while she controlled the House. We can't afford to re-elect a man like Mike McIntyre who said about Obama's failed stimulus, "in our part of the country ­ it has worked." Ladies and gentlemen, let's send Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and their lieutenant Mike McIntyre home and restore America to greatness! Elect Romney-Ryan and Rouzer on November 6!</title></item><item><title>May God bless you and may God bless America. </title></item></channel></rss>
