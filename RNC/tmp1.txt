I want to talk to you tonight not about politics and not about party.</title></item><item><title>And while there are many important issues we'll hear discussed in this convention and throughout this campaign, tonight I want to talk to you from my heart about our hearts. I want to talk not about what divides us, but what holds us together as an American family. I want to talk to you tonight about that one great thing that unites us, that one thing that brings us our greatest joy when times are good, and the deepest solace in our dark hours.</title></item><item><title>Tonight I want to talk to you about love. I want to talk to you about the deep and abiding love I have for a man I met at a dance many years ago.</title></item><item><title>And the profound love I have, and I know we share, for this country. I want to talk to you about that love so deep only a mother can fathom it -- the love we have for our children and our children's children.</title></item><item><title>And I want us to think tonight about the love we all share for those Americans, our brothers and sisters, who are going through difficult times, whose days are never easy, nights are always long, and whose work never seems done.</title></item><item><title>They are here among us tonight in this hall; they are here in neighborhoods across Tampa and all across America.</title></item><item><title>The parents who lie awake at night side by side, wondering how they'll be able to pay the mortgage or make the rent; the single dad who's working extra hours tonight, so that his kids can buy some new clothes to go back to school, can take a school trip or play a sport, so his kids can feel... like the other kids.</title></item><item><title>And the working moms who love their jobs but would like to work just a little less to spend more time with the kids, but that's just out of the question with this economy.</title></item><item><title>Or that couple who would like to have another child, but wonder how will they afford it.</title></item><item><title>I've been all across this country for the past year and a half and heard these stories of how hard it is to get ahead now. I've heard your voices: "I'm running in place," "we just can't get ahead." Sometimes I think that late at night, if we were all silent for just a few moments and listened carefully, we could hear a great collective sigh from the moms and dads across America who made it through another day, and know that they'll make it through another one tomorrow.</title></item><item><title>But in that end of the day moment, they just aren't sure how.</title></item><item><title>And if you listen carefully, you'll hear the women sighing a little bit more than the men.</title></item><item><title>It's how it is, isn't it? It's the moms who always have to work a little harder, to make everything right.</title></item><item><title>It's the moms of this nation -- single, married, widowed -- who really hold this country together.</title></item><item><title>We're the mothers, we're the wives, we're the grandmothers, we're the big sisters, we're the little sisters, we're the daughters.</title></item><item><title>You know it's true, don't you? You're the ones who always have to do a little more.</title></item><item><title>You know what it's like to work a little harder during the day to earn the respect you deserve at work and then come home to help with that book report which just has to be done.</title></item><item><title>You know what those late night phone calls with an elderly parent are like and the long weekend drives just to see how they're doing.</title></item><item><title>You know the fastest route to the local emergency room and which doctors actually answer the phone when you call at night.</title></item><item><title>You know what it's like to sit in that graduation ceremony and wonder how it was that so many long days turned into years that went by so quickly.</title></item><item><title>You are the best of America.</title></item><item><title>You are the hope of America.</title></item><item><title>There would not be an America without you.</title></item><item><title>Tonight, we salute you and sing your praises. I'm not sure if men really understand this, but I don't think there's a woman in America who really expects her life to be easy.</title></item><item><title>In our own ways, we all know better! And that's fine.</title></item><item><title>We don't want easy.</title></item><item><title>But these last few years have been harder than they needed to be.</title></item><item><title>It's all the little things -- that price at the pump you just can't believe, the grocery bills that just get bigger; all those things that used to be free, like school sports, are now one more bill to pay.</title></item><item><title>It's all the little things that pile up to become big things.</title></item><item><title>And the big things -- the good jobs, the chance at college, that home you want to buy, just get harder.</title></item><item><title>Everything has become harder.</title></item><item><title>We're too smart to know there aren't easy answers.</title></item><item><title>But we're not dumb enough to accept that there aren't better answers.</title></item><item><title>And that is where this boy I met at a high school dance comes in.</title></item><item><title>His name is Mitt Romney and you really should get to know him. I could tell you why I fell in love with him -- he was tall, laughed a lot, was nervous -- girls like that, it shows the guy's a little intimidated -- and he was nice to my parents but he was really glad when my parents weren't around.</title></item><item><title>That's a good thing.</title></item><item><title>And he made me laugh. I am the granddaughter of a Welsh coal miner who was determined that his kids get out of the mines.</title></item><item><title>My dad got his first job when he was six years old, in a little village in Wales called Nantyffyllon, cleaning bottles at the Colliers Arms.</title></item><item><title>When he was 15, dad came to America.</title></item><item><title>In our country, he saw hope and an opportunity to escape from poverty.</title></item><item><title>He moved to a small town in the great state of Michigan.</title></item><item><title>There, he started a business -- one he built himself, by the way.</title></item><item><title>He raised a family.</title></item><item><title>And he became mayor of our town.</title></item><item><title>My dad would often remind my brothers and me how fortunate we were to grow up in a place like America.</title></item><item><title>He wanted us to have every opportunity that came with life in this country -- and so he pushed us to be our best and give our all.</title></item><item><title>Inside the houses that lined the streets of our town, there were a lot of good fathers teaching their sons and daughters those same values. I didn't know it at the time, but one of those dads was my future father-in-law, George Romney.</title></item><item><title>Mitt's dad never graduated from college.</title></item><item><title>Instead, he became a carpenter.</title></item><item><title>He worked hard, and he became the head of a car company, and then the governor of Michigan.</title></item><item><title>When Mitt and I met and fell in love, we were determined not to let anything stand in the way of our life together. I was an Episcopalian.</title></item><item><title>He was a Mormon.</title></item><item><title>We were very young.</title></item><item><title>Both still in college.</title></item><item><title>There were many reasons to delay marriage, and you know? We just didn't care.</title></item><item><title>We got married and moved into a basement apartment.</title></item><item><title>We walked to class together, shared the housekeeping, and ate a lot of pasta and tuna fish.</title></item><item><title>Our desk was a door propped up on sawhorses.</title></item><item><title>Our dining room table was a fold down ironing board in the kitchen.</title></item><item><title>Those were very special days.</title></item><item><title>Then our first son came along.</title></item><item><title>All at once I'm 22 years old, with a baby and a husband who's going to business school and law school at the same time, and I can tell you, probably like every other girl who finds herself in a new life far from family and friends, with a new baby and a new husband, that it dawned on me that I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into.</title></item><item><title>That was 42 years ago.</title></item><item><title>Now we have five sons and 18 grandchildren and I'm still in love with that boy I met at a high school dance. I read somewhere that Mitt and I have a "storybook marriage." Well, in the storybooks I read, there were never long, long, rainy winter afternoons in a house with five boys screaming at once.</title></item><item><title>And those storybooks never seemed to have chapters called MS or Breast Cancer. A storybook marriage? No, not at all.</title></item><item><title>What Mitt Romney and I have is a real marriage. I know this good and decent man for what he is -- warm and loving and patient.</title></item><item><title>He has tried to live his life with a set of values centered on family, faith, and love of one's fellow man.</title></item><item><title>From the time we were first married, I've seen him spend countless hours helping others. I've seen him drop everything to help a friend in trouble, and been there when late-night calls of panic came from a member of our church whose child had been taken to the hospital.</title></item><item><title>You may not agree with Mitt's positions on issues or his politics.</title></item><item><title>Massachusetts is only 13% Republican, so it's not like that's a shock.</title></item><item><title>But let me say this to every American who is thinking about who should be our next President: No one will work harder.</title></item><item><title>No one will care more.</title></item><item><title>No one will move heaven and earth like Mitt Romney to make this country a better place to live! It's true that Mitt has been successful at each new challenge he has taken on.</title></item><item><title>It amazes me to see his history of success actually being attacked.</title></item><item><title>Are those really the values that made our country great? As a mom of five boys, do we want to raise our children to be afraid of success? Do we send our children out in the world with the advice, "Try to do... okay?" And let's be honest.</title></item><item><title>If the last four years had been more successful, do we really think there would be this attack on Mitt Romney's success? Of course not.</title></item><item><title>Mitt will be the first to tell you that he is the most fortunate man in the world.</title></item><item><title>He had two loving parents who gave him strong values and taught him the value of work.</title></item><item><title>He had the chance to get the education his father never had.</title></item><item><title>But as his partner on this amazing journey, I can tell you Mitt Romney was not handed success.</title></item><item><title>He built it.</title></item><item><title>He stayed in Massachusetts after graduate school and got a job. I saw the long hours that started with that first job. I was there when he and a small group of friends talked about starting a new company. I was there when they struggled and wondered if the whole idea just wasn't going to work.</title></item><item><title>Mitt's reaction was to work harder and press on.</title></item><item><title>Today that company has become another great American success story.</title></item><item><title>Has it made those who started the company successful beyond their dreams? Yes, it has.</title></item><item><title>It allowed us to give our sons the chance at good educations and made all those long hours of book reports and homework worth every minute.</title></item><item><title>It's given us the deep satisfaction of being able to help others in ways that we could never have imagined.</title></item><item><title>Mitt doesn't like to talk about how he has helped others because he sees it as a privilege, not a political talking point.</title></item><item><title>And we're no different than the millions of Americans who quietly help their neighbors, their churches and their communities.</title></item><item><title>They don't do it so that others will think more of them.</title></item><item><title>They do it because there IS no greater joy. "Give and it shall be given unto you." But because this is America, that small company which grew has helped so many others lead better lives.</title></item><item><title>The jobs that grew from the risks they took have become college educations, first homes.</title></item><item><title>That success has helped fund scholarships, pensions, and retirement funds.</title></item><item><title>This is the genius of America: dreams fulfilled help others launch new dreams.</title></item><item><title>At every turn in his life, this man I met at a high school dance, has helped lift up others.</title></item><item><title>He did it with the Olympics, when many wanted to give up.</title></item><item><title>He did it in Massachusetts, where he guided a state from economic crisis to unemployment of just 4.7%. Under Mitt, Massachusetts's schools were the best in the nation.</title></item><item><title>The best.</title></item><item><title>He started the John and Abigail Adams scholarships, which give the top 25% of high school graduates a four-year tuition-free scholarship.</title></item><item><title>This is the man America needs.</title></item><item><title>This is the man who will wake up every day with the determination to solve the problems that others say can't be solved, to fix what others say is beyond repair.</title></item><item><title>This is the man who will work harder than anyone so that we can work a little less hard. I can't tell you what will happen over the next four years.</title></item><item><title>But I can only stand here tonight, as a wife, a mother, a grandmother, an American, and make you this solemn commitment: This man will not fail.</title></item><item><title>This man will not let us down.</title></item><item><title>This man will lift up America! It has been 47 years since that tall, kind of charming young man brought me home from our first dance.</title></item><item><title>Not every day since has been easy.</title></item><item><title>But he still makes me laugh.</title></item><item><title>And never once did I have a single reason to doubt that I was the luckiest woman in the world. I said tonight I wanted to talk to you about love.</title></item><item><title>Look into your hearts.</title></item><item><title>This is our country.</title></item><item><title>This is our future.</title></item><item><title>These are our children and grandchildren.</title></item><item><title>You can trust Mitt.</title></item><item><title>He loves America.</title></item><item><title>He will take us to a better place, just as he took me home safely from that dance.</title></item><item><title>Give him that chance.</title></item><item><title>Give America that chance.</title></item><item><title>God bless each of you and God Bless the United States of America.</title></item></channel></rss>

We led with our hearts and our dreams that we could be more inclusive than America had ever been, and no candidate had ever spoken so beautifully.</title></item><item><title>But dreams meet daybreak: the jobless know what I mean, so do the families who wonder how this Administration could wreck a recovery for three years and counting.</title></item><item><title>So many of those high-flown words have faded.</title></item><item><title>Remember the President saying of negative politics and untrue ads, "not this time?" Who knew "not this time" just meant "not unless the economy is still stuck and we can't run on our record?" Remember, too, when he said, "this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal?" Who knew the plain English version of it was, "middle America, get ready to shell out 60 bucks to fill up your car?" And in terms of their crown jewel legislative achievement: who knew that when asked, "will government impose a new federal mandate requiring middle class Americans to buy health insurance whether they can afford it or not?" The answer would be "Yes we can!" So, this time, in the name of 23 million of our children and parents and brothers and sisters who are officially unemployed, underemployed, or who have stopped looking for work, let's put the poetry aside, let's suspend the hype, let's come down to earth and start creating jobs again.</title></item><item><title>This time, instead of moving oceans and healing planets, let's get our bills in order and pay down the debt so we control our own future.</title></item><item><title>And of course, we know that opportunity lies outside the reach of some of our people.</title></item><item><title>We don't need flowery words about inequality to tell us that, and we don't need a party that has led while poverty and hunger rose to record levels to give us lectures about suffering.</title></item><item><title>Ladies and gentlemen, there are Americans who are listening to this speech tonight who haven't always been with you, and I want you to let me talk -- just to them ­ for a moment. I know how loaded up our politics is with anger and animosity, but I have to believe we can still make a case over the raised voices.</title></item><item><title>There are Americans who voted for the president, but who are searching right now, because they know that their votes didn't build the country they wanted.</title></item><item><title>To those Democrats and independents whose minds are open to argument: listen closely to the Democratic Party that will gather in Charlotte and ask yourself if you ever hear your voice in the clamor.</title></item><item><title>Ask yourself if these Democrats still speak for you.</title></item><item><title>When they say we have a duty to grow government even when we can't afford it, does it sound like compassion to you -- or recklessness? When you hear the party that glorified Occupy Wall Street blast success; when you hear them minimize the genius of the men and women who make jobs out of nothing, is that what you teach your children about work? When they tell you America is this unequal place where the powerful trample on the powerless, does that sound like the country your children or your spouse risked their lives for in Iraq or Afghanistan? Do you even recognize the America they are talking about? And what can we say about a house that doesn't honor the pictures on its walls? John F. Kennedy asked us what we could do for America.</title></item><item><title>This Democratic Party asks what can government give you.</title></item><item><title>Don't worry about paying the bill, it's on your kids and grandkids.</title></item><item><title>Bill Clinton took on his base and made welfare a thing you had to work for; this current crowd guts the welfare work requirement in the dead of night.</title></item><item><title>Bill Clinton, Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson reached out across the aisle and said meet me in the middle; but their party rammed through a healthcare bill that took over one-sixth of our economy, without accepting a single Republican idea, without winning a single vote in either house from a party whose constituents make up about 50 percent of the country.</title></item><item><title>You know, the Democrats used to have a night when they presented a film of their presidential legends: if they do it in Charlotte, the theme song should be this year's hit, "Somebody That I Used to Know." My fellow Americans, when great athletes falter, their coaches sometimes whisper to them "remember who you are." It's a call to their greatness at a moment when their bodies and spirit are too sapped to remember their strength.</title></item><item><title>This sweet, blessed, God-inspired place called America is a champion that has absorbed some blows.</title></item><item><title>But while we bend, we don't break.</title></item><item><title>This is no dark hour; this is the dawn before we remember who we are.</title></item><item><title>May it be said of this time in our history: 2008 to 2011: lesson learned. 2012: mistake corrected.</title></item><item><title>God bless you, God bless America.</title></item><item><title>Thank you </title></item></channel></rss>

Because they knew ­ if the American public were told that Obamacare was just a massive tax hike, they wouldn't have a prayer of passing it. BONDI: Instead, President Obama and the Democrats called it a mandate.</title></item><item><title>Then they turned around, and without a shred of shame, asked the Court to call the mandate a tax.</title></item><item><title>Yet, the President can't bring himself to acknowledge publicly that the only reason his "'Unaffordable Care Act" still stands ­ is because it is a tax.</title></item><item><title>This is what happens when a President has such total disregard for our individual liberty that he knowingly and purposely imposes unwarranted restrictions against the will of the people.</title></item><item><title>This is not why our Founding Fathers risked their lives and their fortunes when they created a nation.</title></item><item><title>This is not why young American men and women today risk their lives in defense of freedom. OLENS and BONDI: So, tonight, we ask you: BONDI: Do you want skyrocketing health insurance premiums? </title></item><item><title> Do you want enormous new financial burdens on young people who already shoulder our nation's crushing debt? BONDI: Do you want the government to force individuals and religious institutions to violate the tenets of their faith? </title></item><item><title> Do you want over $1 trillion in tax increases? BONDI: Do you want a job-destroying insurance mandate that strangles businesses?</title></item><item><title>Do you want a federal government that tells you what to do, what to think, or what to buy when it comes to your health care? BONDI: Do you want the federal government to steal hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare to hide the true costs of Obamacare? </title></item><item><title> Do you want more of this for four more years? The health care lawsuit has reminded all of us that the Constitution limits the power of government.</title></item><item><title>It has reminded us of the precious relationship between federalism and individual liberty.</title></item><item><title>And though we fundamentally disagree with his decision, Chief Justice Roberts did observe that it is not the Supreme Court's "job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices." BONDI: It is our job to make a new choice.</title></item><item><title>It is time to stand up and say, in a loud, clear voice, "Enough!" It is time to repeal Obamacare! It is time to stop those who ignore the Constitution when it's expedient! It is time to remember that our rights are not a gift from government, but from God, and that by His grace we will defend them! It is time for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.</title></item><item><title>Thank you! </title></item></channel></rss>

I stand here tonight humbled to share with you the story of a nation, a state and of one man.</title></item><item><title>It is the story of America itself ­ of courageous, freedom-loving visionaries who believed in the promise of opportunity, rather than the divine right of kings.</title></item><item><title>Who dared to dream that anyone could rise above the circumstances of their birth.</title></item><item><title>It is also the story of the great Silver State: Battle Born Nevada! We joined the Union to help keep Abraham Lincoln in the White House and fulfill the promise of opportunity, as he ended forever the scourge of slavery.</title></item><item><title>And, it is my story: the child of working-class Hispanic Americans who has lived the American dream.</title></item><item><title>The Proverbs tell us "from small beginnings come great things." My father was one of ten children.</title></item><item><title>My mother and her family lived in a tiny, two-bedroom house in the Southwest.</title></item><item><title>Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician.</title></item><item><title>Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher.</title></item><item><title>We lived a simple American life.</title></item><item><title>When I was a boy, my parents brought us to Nevada in search of opportunity.</title></item><item><title>My first job was cleaning sheep pens.</title></item><item><title>In college, I worked in a hospital cafeteria. I worked my way through law school.</title></item><item><title>Encouraged by my parents' love for this country, I dreamed of public service. I became a state legislator, a gaming regulator, and attorney general of my state.</title></item><item><title>My story could end there, but this is America.</title></item><item><title>And so, in 2005, a simple son of promise was appointed by President Bush, and confirmed by the United States Senate as a federal judge. I saw in my courtroom the fulfillment of all that our forefathers sought to create. A nation of laws. A nation of due process and merit and justice for all.</title></item><item><title>And, yes, a nation of immigrants.</title></item><item><title>One of the greatest duties I performed was to administer the oath of citizenship to new Americans ­ immigrants who embody our dream of opportunity and prosperity.</title></item><item><title>But from the federal bench, I also saw a nation beset on all sides by unprecedented challenges. I watched my state's economy falter, stagnate and slide into decline.</title></item><item><title>Nevadans lost their jobs and their homes.</title></item><item><title>Nevada was hit hardest by the recession ­ highest unemployment, highest foreclosure rate, highest bankruptcy rate.</title></item><item><title>Like so many, I looked around for help.</title></item><item><title>And what did I find? A president who promised change, but turned instead to the same tired strategy of ever-larger government. A president who abandoned hope and embraced only blame.</title></item><item><title>So I stepped down from a lifetime appointment to make a difference. I ran for governor, was elected and, like Republican governors all across this nation, I chose to make the tough decisions: On issues like economic development, education reform and redesigning how state government operates.</title></item><item><title>On job creation, and reducing state spending, and eliminating red tape.</title></item><item><title>It hasn't been easy.</title></item><item><title>And we're not through it yet.</title></item><item><title>But I have put my faith in the people of my great state ­ because they are the ones who will grow our economy. I have seen Hispanic business owners and families from backgrounds -- not unlike my own -struggle in this economy. I have seen young children from all walks of life begin to wonder if their future holds any hope at all.</title></item><item><title>Make no mistake: The current administration's failed experiment with big government gets in the way of economic recovery.</title></item><item><title>Their love affair with government regulation is a drag on business confidence.</title></item><item><title>From personal experience, I can tell you what will help states like Nevada and families like mine: elect the team that understands how to get America working again.</title></item><item><title>Send Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to the White House! This administration sings the siren song that this is all there is.</title></item><item><title>They tell us government is the answer, but we know it's the problem.</title></item><item><title>They tell us we didn't build our businesses, but somebody else made it happen.</title></item><item><title>They tell us not to dream but to settle.</title></item><item><title>You and I know America is better than that.</title></item><item><title>Our national story is one of confronting challenges ­ and winning.</title></item><item><title>We have overcome economic devastation, defeated mighty oppressors and lifted up generation after generation of Americans.</title></item><item><title>We can ­ and we will ­ do it again.</title></item><item><title>For that is our birthright as members of the American family ­ white, black, Hispanic, Asian, immigrant or descendent of the Founding Fathers themselves.</title></item><item><title>We must leave Tampa this week on a mission to remind Americans they deserve more than the status quo.</title></item><item><title>They deserve to dream big.</title></item><item><title>We must remind Americans that the promise of opportunity remains unbroken ­ that every person in this great nation can succeed through hard work, courage and personal responsibility.</title></item><item><title>For that is the real American story.</title></item><item><title>Thank you.</title></item><item><title>And now, let me introduce to you one of those Hispanic business owners that I mentioned are struggling in this economy, Mr.</title></item><item><title>Phil Archuletta of New Mexico.</title></item></channel></rss>

I was her son as I moved into a studio apartment with Mary Pat to start a marriage that is now 26 years old.</title></item><item><title>I was her son as I coached our sons Andrew and Patrick on the fields of Mendham, and as I watched with pride as our daughters Sarah and Bridget marched with their soccer teams in the Labor Day parade.</title></item><item><title>And I am still her son today, as Governor, following the rules she taught me: to speak from the heart and to fight for your principles.</title></item><item><title>She never thought you get extra credit for just speaking the truth.</title></item><item><title>The greatest lesson Mom ever taught me, though, was this one: she told me there would be times in your life when you have to choose between being loved and being respected.</title></item><item><title>She said to always pick being respected, that love without respect was always fleeting -- but that respect could grow into real, lasting love.</title></item><item><title>Now, of course, she was talking about women.</title></item><item><title>But I have learned over time that it applies just as much to leadership.</title></item><item><title>In fact, I think that advice applies to America today more than ever.

A solid education should be the second rung on the ladder to success, but the system is failing.</title></item><item><title>President Obama's solution has been to deny parents choice, attack private schools and nationalize curriculum and student loans.</title></item><item><title>Mitt Romney believes that parents and the local community must be put in charge -- not the Department of Education.</title></item><item><title>We all know there is one key to success that has helped people overcome even the greatest of obstacles - hard work.</title></item><item><title>That's why work was the centerpiece of the bipartisan welfare reform law.</title></item><item><title>Requiring work as a condition for receiving welfare succeeded -- and not just because the welfare rolls were cut in half -- but because employment went way up, poverty went down and dreams were realized.</title></item><item><title>It's a sturdy ladder to success that is built with healthy families, education and hard work.</title></item><item><title>But President Obama's policies undermine the traditional family, weaken the education system.</title></item><item><title>And this summer he showed us once again he believes in government handouts and dependency by waiving the work requirement for welfare. I helped write welfare reform; we made the law crystal clear - no president can waive the work requirement.</title></item><item><title>But as with his refusal to enforce our immigration laws, President Obama rules like he is above the law.</title></item><item><title>America take heed, when a president can simply give a speech or write a memo and change the law to do what the law says he can't, we weaken our republic.</title></item><item><title>Yet as my family and I crisscrossed America, something became so obvious to us.</title></item><item><title>America is still the greatest country in the world ­ and with God's help and good leadership we can restore the American Dream.</title></item><item><title>Why? I held its hand. I shook the hand of the American Dream.</title></item><item><title>And it has a strong grip.

Which one would you choose to invest your life's savings?</title></item><item><title>Should it be any different for safeguarding our nation's economy? Or let's say you don't have any savings.</title></item><item><title>Let's say you're worried about how to pay September's rent or mortgage.</title></item><item><title>Let's say you are one of the millions of Americans out of work or the millions more who have given up looking.</title></item><item><title>You've gotta be running out of patience ­ and hope.</title></item><item><title>You have to be tired, looking for a new start.</title></item><item><title>Well, you don't have to be patient any longer.</title></item><item><title>Through your vote this fall you can change the leadership of this country and the opportunities for you and your family.</title></item><item><title>America, it has been nearly four years of over eight percent unemployment ­ and double digit unemployment for young people, Hispanics and African-Americans.</title></item><item><title>Four years. FDR and Truman won an entire world war in four years.</title></item><item><title>America is tired of waiting.</title></item><item><title>In business, if you don't move rapidly, you are out of business.</title></item><item><title>You are finished.</title></item><item><title>We want a president who operates at business speed not government speed.</title></item><item><title>President Obama says he deserves reelection because his economic policies have worked. NOT in this universe they haven't.</title></item><item><title>In fact, the experts tell us that if we don't change our policies we are going back into recession next year.</title></item><item><title>Tens of millions of Americans are not out of the last recession! Governor Romney had a plan to build his business.</title></item><item><title>He now has a detailed plan to restore our economy and strengthen the middle class. I ask you: Where is the president's economic plan? Blaming others does not qualify as a plan.</title></item><item><title>Now the president did submit a budget.</title></item><item><title>It was so bad that not a single Republican or a single Democrat in the entire United States Congress would vote for it.</title></item><item><title>He got zero votes.</title></item><item><title>That is a failure of leadership.</title></item><item><title>President Obama has been right about at least one prediction he's made about the economy.</title></item><item><title>He said, "If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition." I think you are right about that, Mr.</title></item><item><title>President.</title></item><item><title>It hasn't worked, because you cannot spend your way, regulate your way, tax your way or blame your way out of the economic mess we are in.</title></item><item><title>You have to liberate the productive power of the American people through policies that encourage innovation, risk taking, investment and jobs.</title></item><item><title>And you have to compete and win in the global economy.</title></item><item><title>Governor Romney understands this.</title></item><item><title>In contrast, President Obama is the first president in 75 years--Democrat or Republican--who hasn't even sought the ability to negotiate export agreements and open markets overseas.</title></item><item><title>Now why is this important? Because 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside our borders.</title></item><item><title>And to create jobs, our workers and our farmers need to sell more of what we make to those people.</title></item><item><title>While this administration has been dragging its feet, other countries have been busy negotiating hundreds of new trade agreements to benefit their workers and their farmers, taking away our opportunities.</title></item><item><title>President Obama has been so driven to advance his big government ideology that he has abandoned the daily economic work that a government must do to open markets, restore business confidence and create the climate for job growth.</title></item><item><title>This is the work President Romney would begin on day one.</title></item><item><title>Take trade with China.</title></item><item><title>China manipulates its currency giving it an unfair trade advantage.</title></item><item><title>So why doesn't the president do something about it? I'll tell you one reason ­ President Obama could not run up his record trillion dollar deficits if the Chinese did not buy our bonds to finance them.</title></item><item><title>We are as beholden to China for bonds as we are to the Middle East for oil.</title></item><item><title>This will end under Mitt Romney.</title></item><item><title>We need to knock down these trade barriers abroad, but we also need to knock down the selfimposed barriers to success right here at home.</title></item><item><title>We need to reform our outdated and complicated tax code.</title></item><item><title>We need to fix our burdensome regulatory system and we need an energy policy that encourages development of our resources right here, in the ground, in America.</title></item><item><title>America has a choice between Mitt Romney, who seeks to grow the economy, and Barack Obama who seeks to redistribute it.</title></item><item><title>Which one do you think will liberate America's entrepreneurial spirit? At the other party's convention, you will hear the chant, "Four more years.</title></item><item><title>Four more years." Folks ­ we can't afford four more years.</title></item><item><title>How about no more years? Governor Romney chose a terrific partner in Paul Ryan of Wisconsin ­ Paul is a close friend with a great family and a reformer's heart.</title></item><item><title>Vice President Biden has told people out of work to just, "hang in there." So much for hope and change.</title></item><item><title>Paul Ryan is not asking America to continue to hang in there.</title></item><item><title>He is proposing new policies that will give poor and middle class families opportunities and hope for the future.</title></item><item><title>Mitt Romney made his mark turning around businesses and solving problems.</title></item><item><title>Paul Ryan made his mark as a respected reformer focused on results.</title></item><item><title>Together they will do what President Obama has not done: They will lead in breaking through the partisan gridlock in Washington, D.C. America, give them the chance to restore America's economy and restore the American dream. I have seen that dream up close.</title></item><item><title>When I was a kid, my dad left his job as a salesman and started his own business selling forklift trucks.</title></item><item><title>My Mom was the bookkeeper.</title></item><item><title>He had to borrow money from her uncle because the bank wouldn't give him a loan.</title></item><item><title>He lost money for the first few years, but he never lost his dream.</title></item><item><title>And by the time he retired and my brother took over, the business had 200 employees ­ supporting 200 families in Southwest Ohio.</title></item><item><title>This is the classic American story ­ not of government telling us what to do ­ but of free men and free women willing to work hard and take a risk to build something of value for themselves, their families and their community.</title></item><item><title>About a year into the Obama Administration ­ I asked my dad whether he would do it again.</title></item><item><title>He said, "Rob ­ with all the uncertainty out there today ­ I don't know if I would take the risk." In that one sentence, he summed up what I've heard from hundreds of small business owners across Ohio and around this great country.</title></item><item><title>They're afraid to make the investment and jobs are the casualty.</title></item><item><title>Ladies and gentlemen, we need new leadership and new policies to bring back the dream and renew America's promise.</title></item><item><title>No more excuses, no more blaming others, no more waiting.</title></item><item><title>We need Romney /Ryan and we need them now! And with your help, it will happen.</title></item><item><title>Thank you and God bless our great country. </title></item></channel></rss>

G3 is one of those companies that added jobs during the past year, and now has plans to add even more.</title></item><item><title>The owner told me that he's creating additional jobs in Wisconsin because he likes the way we are moving our state forward ­ and he's even more committed since the election.</title></item><item><title>Without our positive changes, he told me he would not have had the confidence to grow his business in Wisconsin.</title></item><item><title>Improving the business climate is not only good for small business owners; it's good for people like Sandy and her family.</title></item><item><title>We need more stories like hers in America because the past couple of years have been well, pretty tough.</title></item><item><title>Like many places across the country, Wisconsin lost more than 100,000 jobs from 2008 to 2010.</title></item><item><title>Unemployment during that time topped out at over 9%. But because of our reforms, Wisconsin has added thousands of new jobs and our unemployment rate is down from when I first took office.</title></item><item><title>Equally as important, we improved the economic climate for job creators.</title></item><item><title>Today, 94% of our employers believe Wisconsin is headed in the right direction.</title></item><item><title>That compares to just 10% who thought the same thing two years ago.</title></item><item><title>Elections have consequences! As was the case in Wisconsin two years ago, too many Americans think our country is headed in the wrong direction.</title></item><item><title>But Mitt Romney understands, like I understand, that people ­ not governments ­ create jobs.</title></item><item><title>With that in mind, my Administration is making it easier for people to create jobs in Wisconsin.</title></item><item><title>Our reforms put the hard working taxpayers back in charge ­ people like Sandy Breth.</title></item><item><title>Sadly, the federal government seems to be going in the opposite direction.</title></item><item><title>Nationally, we've experienced 42 consecutive months of unemployment above 8%. Last month, 44 of the 50 states saw an increase in the unemployment rate.</title></item><item><title>And more than 12 million of our fellow citizens are unemployed.</title></item><item><title>We need someone to turn things around in America.</title></item><item><title>That leader is Governor Mitt Romney.</title></item><item><title>Mitt Romney turned businesses around in the private sector.</title></item><item><title>He saved the Winter Olympics.</title></item><item><title>And he balanced state budgets without raising taxes, and in a way that helped the private sector create more jobs.</title></item><item><title>Then, with the announcement of Paul Ryan as his running mate, Governor Romney not only showed that he has the experience and the skill needed to become president, he showed he has the courage and the passion to be an exceptional president.</title></item><item><title>With this pick he showed us that the "R" next to his name doesn't just stand for Republican, it stands for Reformer.</title></item><item><title>Now, more than ever, we need reformers: leaders who think more about the next generation than just the next election.</title></item><item><title>That's what you get from Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.</title></item><item><title>In a few weeks, we will celebrate the 225th anniversary of our federal Constitution.</title></item><item><title>Moments like that remind us that what makes America so great, what makes us exceptional, is that throughout our history, in moments of crisis, be they economic or fiscal, military or spiritual.</title></item><item><title>What makes America amazing is that there have always been men and women of courage who were willing to think more about the future of their children and grandchildren than they did about their own political careers.</title></item><item><title>Let this be one of those moments.</title></item><item><title>Let this be our time in history so that someday we can tell our children and grandchildren that we were there, that we changed the course of history for the better.</title></item><item><title>Let us tell them that we helped elect Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to save America.</title></item><item><title>Thank you. </title></item></channel></rss>

I've seen these on TV ­ what an honor to be here with you. I'm a mother from Delaware, a co-owner with my husband of First State Manufacturing.</title></item><item><title>And after this November, I plan on taking on a new title: the next Lieutenant Governor of the Great State of Delaware.</title></item><item><title>Tonight, it is my honor to talk about the three themes that inspired me to run for office:    My family.</title></item><item><title>The business we built.</title></item><item><title>And my belief in America's unlimited potential.</title></item><item><title>But it starts with a wonderful story.</title></item><item><title>Shortly after our son was born, my husband and I received some news that would change our lives forever.</title></item><item><title>We learned that our son Simon was autistic.</title></item><item><title>We loved him with every fiber in our being.</title></item><item><title>But the "experts" told us not to expect much. "Your son will never learn to read, write, or communicate effectively," they said. "Accept these limits," they seemed to say.</title></item><item><title>It was a tough time.</title></item><item><title>We quickly realized that the jobs we had wouldn't pay for the professionals Simon needed to overcome the odds.</title></item><item><title>So we followed a deep and long-standing American tradition.</title></item><item><title>We took a risk.</title></item><item><title>We bet on the future.</title></item><item><title>We started our own business.</title></item><item><title>When he was serving in the Army, my husband had taken a mail order course on upholstery.</title></item><item><title>One day I came home to find him pulling out the second hand sewing machine he'd learned his craft on.</title></item><item><title>He called her "Old Betsy." A second-generation Mexican-American, my husband will do whatever it takes to provide for his family.</title></item><item><title>Our friends thought we were crazy.</title></item><item><title>Didn't we have enough challenges trying to raise Simon? Why not just accept our lot in life? That's when I remembered something my dad used to say.</title></item><item><title>My dad was an old school guy. A former drill sergeant.</title></item><item><title>Blue collar union worker his whole life.</title></item><item><title>He taught us to work hard and think big. I remember he once pulled off the road and pointed at a big factory. "That's more than a building," he told me. "It took a lot of work to get that big.</title></item><item><title>It started out as just an idea at some guy's kitchen table." I guess you could say our upholstery business was OUR kitchen table idea.</title></item><item><title>Fifteen years later we employ more than 70 people in our 70,000 square foot factory.</title></item><item><title>And we're so proud of what we do.</title></item><item><title>We make umpire vests for Little Leagues.</title></item><item><title>Products for the men and women serving our country.</title></item><item><title>Restaurant seats for pizza chains.</title></item><item><title>And protective gear for our allies in the Israeli military.</title></item><item><title>We're actually taking work away from Chinese and Mexican competitors ­ and bringing it back to Delaware! How did it happen?</title></item><item><title>We defied the odds.</title></item><item><title>We rolled the dice on losing ­ or gaining ­ everything.</title></item><item><title>We didn't listen to the experts.</title></item><item><title>We grew our dream.</title></item><item><title>And with our son Simon, we didn't listen to the experts either.</title></item><item><title>Yes, he still struggles with autism.</title></item><item><title>But this past June, he completed his first year at the University of Delaware. I can't tell you how much this means to him ­ and how much it means to me, the mom of a special needs child.</title></item><item><title>Raising our family and building our business have been the passions of our lives, and what struck me is how similar they are.</title></item><item><title>If you've ever raised a child or started a business, you know what I'm talking about.</title></item><item><title>You put your heart and soul into it.</title></item><item><title>You work to find the 25th hour in the day You struggle to overcome insurmountable odds.</title></item><item><title>And you do it all because you believe in an unlimited future. "An unlimited future." Isn't that what America is all about? But today, when I talk to the young families and the struggling businesses I meet throughout Delaware, I have to ask: are we creating an unlimited future for them? A Gallup report recently said nearly 50% of small businesses owners aren't hiring because of what they call "regulatory uncertainty." Can you blame them? This Administration has imposed 106 new major regulations.</title></item><item><title>They are on track to create 109 million new paperwork burden hours.</title></item><item><title>And by year's end, $110 billion dollars' worth of new regulatory costs will be laid on the backs of business owners and taxpayers.</title></item><item><title>You might call that "regulatory uncertainty." I call it an all-out assault on free enterprise.</title></item><item><title>That's what worries me about this Administration.</title></item><item><title>They seem so eager to "fix" society.</title></item><item><title>But they don't have a clue about how to fix the economy.</title></item><item><title>In the end, it all comes down to what you believe.</title></item><item><title>And yes, they are believers! The Obama Administration believes in "experts" and blue ribbon panels.</title></item><item><title>They believe in creating new agencies and boards.</title></item><item><title>They believe in all that ­ but they just don't trust the entrepreneur's ability to grow her own business and to create jobs.</title></item><item><title>Mitt Romney not only believes in the values of economic freedom.</title></item><item><title>His entire life has been committed to advancing it.</title></item><item><title>Last April, I was privileged to be one of a dozen business leaders in Delaware to sit down and meet with Mitt Romney.</title></item><item><title>This wasn't some scripted photo op; this wasn't a staged event; this was a real discussion with someone who understands where small business is coming from.</title></item><item><title>You see, for Governor Romney, free enterprise isn't just a theory you study in graduate school.</title></item><item><title>It's a creed. A commitment. A world view.</title></item><item><title>It's what connects Americans, families, and communities, to an unlimited future.</title></item><item><title>That's why this election is so important to our small businesses and to our country.

It's the story of the greatest generation of Americans, who rose up to confront the grotesque evil that was the Nazis, and ushered in the greatest era of peace and prosperity the world has ever seen.</title></item><item><title>It's the story of civil-rights heroes, like Dr.</title></item><item><title>Martin Luther King, who stood strong against the scourge of discrimination, and bravely championed that every man and woman should be judged, not by the color of our skin, but by the content of our character.</title></item><item><title>It's the story of President Ronald Reagan, who turned back the creeping growth of government and restored Morning in America.</title></item><item><title>Who spoke out against the oppressive evil of communism and demanded "Mr.</title></item><item><title>Gorbachev, tear down this wall."
