August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 I'm pleased to be here representing my fellow Republican mayors. In Oklahoma, we think we've made a very real and substantial contribution to this presidential ticket. Janna Ryan, the smart and charming wife of the next Vice President of the United States, is from Oklahoma, and Paul and Janna were married in Oklahoma City. It's becoming more and more unusual for our best and brightest to leave the state, but in this case we're glad it's worked out the way it has. We're enjoying a renaissance in Oklahoma City. It's a renaissance fueled by sound, fiscally conservative leadership and a belief that local investment in infrastructure is vital to economic development. Twenty years ago we decided "we can do better" and we have. Today, we have the nation's lowest unemployment rate among large U.S. metropolitan areas. While there is a role for Washington in addressing our city's critical infrastructure needs ­ we chose to invest in ourselves. We built quality-of-life amenities that have transformed our city into a dynamic home for smart young people and enterprising businesses. Oklahoma City was recently named as the most entrepreneurial city in the country, with the most start-ups per capita.Interestingly, we have NOT done this by creating large amounts of debt. We did something unique for many of our infrastructure packages: we paid cash. Today we are building a community that is more walkable, more sustainable, more affordable and more business-friendly, and we are building it with the kind of common-sense economic policies that we need in Washington, policies that Mitt Romney will deliver as the next president of the United States. Thank you. ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee  </pre>
