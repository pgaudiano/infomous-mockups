August 28, 2012 EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERYContact James Davis or Kyle Downey (813) 252-5888Tampa, Fla. ­ The following are the remarks as prepared for delivery by U.S. Representatives Francisco Canseco. The actual remarks may differ. The Hon. Francisco Canseco U.S. Representative (TX-23) (Remarks as Prepared for Delivery) August 28, 2012 My name is Francisco Canseco. I represent the 23rd Congressional District of Texas. Mitt Romney and I share a simple belief. We owe our children a better future. We owe them a future without high unemployment, higher taxes and a crushing burden of debt. Along the nearly 800 miles of US-Mexico border that I serve, farmers, small businesses and families are striving to live the American dream. Whether you are a seventh generation American or a first generation immigrant, like my parents were, coming to seek a better life, we all want the opportunity to succeed. Unfortunately, Barack Obama is burdening us with destructive debt, punishing taxes, and robbing us of that opportunity to succeed. We can ensure our children have a brighter future if we follow this guidance. Un gobierno limitado y menos impuestos significan más oportunidad y mejores empleos para un futuro más próspero para las siguientes generaciones. Con Mitt Romney como Presidente - lo podemos hacer mejor. The answer is simple. Lower taxes and less government means more opportunity and better job creation for a brighter future for generations to come.We can do better with Mitt Romney as President. Thank you! ###Paid for by the Committee on Arrangements for the 2012 Republican National Convention www.GOPConvention2012.com - Phone: (813) 381-5588 Not Authorized By Any Candidate or Candidate's Committee</pre>
