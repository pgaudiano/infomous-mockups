	<description>"Here, in the IT department, at Monaco RV, many of our tasks/projects are isolated from the larger company IT department but there have been some areas that company has taken over or partnered with our department.  From my position as a DBA I see the main business value provided now to our department is the certainty and security that we can weather the storms which can be of great value in actual work product because people will and can focus more on their work.  Also, while certain areas have been absorbed by the parent IT department, many of the services provided by our department are enhanced by the addition of people and the corporate oversight that comes with being a part of company."</description>

	<description>"I don't think the current ticket creation process (by calling 1300) is value added. Often I have to call up 1300 and explain the issue, more often than not, this ticket is forwarded to the local support team. The ticket that is sent to the local support team often includes a very brief description of the issue, so I have to take time to explain the issue all over to the onsite support person. There used to a option to go online and create tickets using a web based interface, and this process was far more efficient. A web based tool for ticket creation and status tracking will be value added. "</description>

Our drawing viewer, CadSearch, has to be one of the most archaic viewers in existience, but no work has been done to improve it.  Teamcenter, which is a good data manager, is being toughted as the new viewer even though it takes at least 5 minutes to login assuming that you can log in at all due to numerous ""unable to bind"" errors.  Please upgrade CadSearch or Pharos and use it instead of pushing Teamcenter as the cure for all our ills."</description>

	<description>"many issues exist regarding the ability of IT to coordinate with other organizations to help employees obtain the necessary permissions / acces to key systems. I have been routinely frustrated by  what it takes for me and some of my employees to obtain permissions to get things done. IMO, the onus is on IT to work with security, finance et al... to streamline how these things are done."</description>

For example, to look up a part number it can be done in Teamcenter, Part Trak, PIQ, and PHAROS and all parts may not be in all databases.  Some of it is ITAR related, which I understand to a point, but other differences are because the databases don't talk to each other.  There should be one, unified part database."</description>

	<description>"The engineering IT systems do not provide a solution for Escobedo and other off-sites locations.  Also, the UG computers are old and slow.  company IT needs to understand that engineering efficiency should take priority over saving computer costs.  IT does not focus on improving electrical tools choosing to focus solely on mechanical tools."</description>

The IT guy next to me gets notified anyway, but now it takes a day longer. Person on the phone was polite but very hard to understand.

	<description>"The IT service is terrible.  When I have an IT need, I need my request to be delt with immediately.  It is a huge waste of time and resources to have to speak to 5 different people in India before I am able to connect with a ND IT professional.  I would prefer to have a specific contact for our DC office whom I may contact at any time.  I usually end up fixing my IT issue through research before I am able to connect with a member of the IT staff."</description>

	<description>"The response time when calling/emailing the IT Sevice Desk is rather long, sometimes over 72 hours.  When you do reach someone, they do not seem to understand our systems, software, IT structure, etc.  This makes both parties involved very frustrated.  Often times tickets are not resolved timely and accurately, resulting in more tickets being created as they say it isn't related to the original ticket.  Once the ticket is escalated to company IT, the response time is quick and is resolved accurately the first time."</description>

	<description>"IT needs to communicate WISE models, and what it means to business, but really work on the new and emerging technologies piece.  What does SOA mean for business?  Why is there so much shadow IT working on workflow in SharePoint - why isn't there a workflow tool strategy or BPMS plan being communicated?  How can company leverage mobile apps as part of strategy to grow business and improve customer satisfaction?  Technologies like telematics aren't coming from IT - they come from engineering.  What other technologies are out there and why does business care?"</description>

	<description>"Engineering Design currently needs a lot of help from IT to make sure .jt files are created everytime. Currently, due to various reasons (....training of designer's being one of them), the UG files do not tesselate when data is ""statused"" in TCE. This causes a chain reaction, with engineers having the designers to make .jt files manually and passing the files around in emails. This causes mass confusion downstream when noboady can accurately identify the latest .jt CAD files. "</description>

We use a CAD program that our group, CAD professionals, used to maintain and set up for us to run at a high level of efficiency. We are now forced to try to explain to others how to do what we used to do. What used to take a small amount of time to fix now takes hours and sometimes days to get addressed. There are somethings I don't even bother asking for anymore, even though it would make me more productive. Too much of a hassle to maybe get it resolved."</description>

	<description>"If IT is responsible for laptop selection then I would disagree.  I have been issued an 8440p and am expected to run MATLAB and IDEAS.  I cannot open more than a few components in IDEAS or else it freezes.  And I am developing algorithms for data processing in MATLAB, the data I work with is on the order of 10's of GB. I have needlessly spent nearly 60 extra hours becuase the computer runs out of memory and crashes, forcing me to start over and try to split the files, which is less valuable to the company and nearly 3 times more time consuming. --If It is not responsible for this, then I would rank them as 3."</description>

	<description>"Many problems that require large scale fixes are addressed as individual issues.  Problems with the titleblock are an example of this.  While it would be best to fix the titleblock program itself, it becomes necessary to take out a ticket for repeated instances of the same problem on different drawings."</description>

	<description>Oracle/Stellant speed and time out issues keeps us in the dark ages.  Printer problems that occur often are also a problem.  Now they are going to do away with the extra printers throughout the offices.  Which will cause more time of standing around and having to wait until other people's print jobs are complete. Timing is of the essence and we need to squeeze in as much work as possible during a day.  We can't do that with less printers.</description>

We have no competence internally in any web design technologys or modern web development technologies.  We cannot be innovative when we cannot design build transactional web sites effectively!And, what about mobile computing?  There is no area devoted to do that.Rather than be focused and staffed on ""technology trends"" like SOA, IT needs to be focused instead on staffing and meeting customer needs in business-facing areas, such as web design, mobile computing, collaborative technologies, etc.  "</description>

The only innovation is finding innovative ways to speak the english language in a way that the helpdesk can understand your problem.  Before IBM most IT issues were taken care of within 24 hours.  Now those same issues take a week and more recently 15 days to fix due to the lack of understanding, refusal to listen to the problem and route it to the right person, and problems not being on a ""script"" and dropped in the helpdesk que.  Then it is set to resolved because no one understood how to fix it.  "</description>

	<description>"The TOLAS system is so antiquated,it is a hinderance.  I cannot believe how much work is done by hand, especially simple things like tallying.  There are so many current and reliable tools out there for PC's that are not being utilized by company.  It makes company business move SLOWLY, which makes us that much less competitive."</description>

	<description>"Big issues with planview process.  Requests are submitted and stay in submittal status until you ping someone.  No one seems measured on how many requests are assigned to them, time to resolve.  Requests are submitted, and aren't discussed with appropriate BRCL representation - requests are assigned to who works on the app, not the business person who submitted request.  The submitter might not be on BRCL that reviews request.  Many definitions within planview aren't defined and are up to users discretion when allocating time so metrics will be bogus.  When I am teaching a class, should I enter it as non-project training, group communications, or some other bucket.  If management doesn't define it, you can automate planview routing all you want but still not improve it."</description>

	<description>"The only reason I am choosing 4 is because every company needs an IT department.  I believe our is soarly lacking.  If they'd start making wiser decisions about the software they have us use.  Peoplesoft is just about the worst program/software that I have ever used.  To look up a PO in Project Phoenix you end up with 3 internet sessions running?  I know it's not called Project Phoenix, but that is what I know it as (or Oracle). Then when you open it you get a security warning of some sort, but it's okay to continue???  I don't know, but that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. It seems as though there's alway ""band-aids"" or quick fixes put in place.  My biggest concern is when they replace the pricing system and then TOLAS.  What band-aids will we need for that?"</description>

	<description>The people at the 800# are not only hard to understand at times but also lack the ability to properly understand what the issue is when I call most of the times. Tickets have been issued with the wrong description and issues not resolved with 1 phone call. In May I called twice about 2 separate issues & advised the person I was working from home & needed to be called back on my cell phone. 4 times the 800# person told me that someone would call my office number about the issue even after I told them I wasn't in the office & to only reference my cell phone number. For the one issue someone in local IT contacted my office number & got my manager's ph# from my voice mail & called him about my ticket. My manager was unaware of the issue & therefore the ticket was not resolved. For the 2nd example I again told the 800# person I was out of the office & needed to be called on my cell phone. 3 days later I received an email from an internal IT person asking me to contact him about my issue. I questioned why no one had called me at home as I requested on the ticket when I called on 5/23. He replied that there was no home or cell ph# listed on the ticket. I am very disappointed at the 800# people. This is just a couple examples of the problems I have experienced. When you ask around everyone says the only time they call the 800# is if absolutely needed as it is a waste of time as issues are not resolved due to lack of response or the person at the 800# doesn't understand the issue & issue a ticket appropriately.</description>

Rather than prioritize, we start everything and consequently everything moves forward slowly and ends up being later than the business expects.  Resources are split 4-6 different ways, if not more, with no focus allowed to get things done on time and right."</description>

	<description>"Definitely better at communicating enterprise-wide initiatives (those seem to be shouted from the rooftops on NavConnect) than communicating on a personal basis.    For example, when requests are entered via email, the response does not reiterate the issue.  If you have only one issue at a time, that might not be a problem, but...when you are submitting requests for multiple users, that can be a problem (identifying which SR# corresponds to which issue)!  We receive no updates on new Equipment that is ordered or is in the queue for build out - unless we chase them down ourselves."</description>

	<description>"I get automated email requests when I call the help desk in timely manner, but doesn't really say anything.  Receiving my request doesn't mean it's being looked at.  I get email again when it's assigned a ticket number, which I guess means it's being looked at, and  then again when resolution is closed.  Sometimes I get emails again weeks later after ticket number is assigned - it was routed to someone else, issue was resolved, but never closed out.  Why wait 3-4 weeks to ask if it's been resolved instead of sooner?  Are there any SLAs in place that are aligned with when we need it resolved by?  Could ask customer when they need issue resolved, but would be surprised if anyone ever said anything other than asap."</description>

Practice what you're going to say a few times and just state the facts quickly and concisely. ""Known problem -> Ticket# -> Estimated Completion Time."" done. Again I am not aware of any ""...relevant enterprise-wide initiatives."""</description>

	<description>"When it comes to projects or tweaks to something that already exists, there is not much communication as to status.  This is true for almost all IT issues that are put into the larger IT infrastructure (e.g. Planview).  If it is a project that requires any kind of work, it seems to be difficult to track and not much follow up, if any, is initiated by IT. There also seems to be too much compartmentalism - and when one follows up, it is 'this group does this task and another group does another task'.  This arrangement doesn't seem very efficient.

	<description>"I am an AME employee based in Melrose Park.  Upon a trip to Huntsville, I realized I forgot my power adapter for my laptop.  I asked a level 7 at Huntsville for help and he went to local IT and gave me a power adapter and said, ""you can keep it"".  A MONTH LATER....he came to me and asked for it back saying, ""you are not a Huntsville employee, IT requires that you return the power adapter.""  THIS IS CRAZY, DO WE WORK FOR THE SAME COMPANY OR NOT?  A $60 power adapter is not going to break anybody's budget.  How can we be a $20Billion company if we can't figure out how to either cross charge other departments or allow small charges like this to be incurred?"</description>

	<description>IT is alligned with less functionality and move restriction. I can't use my own C drive. While overseas the upload to my favorites was 110 minutes. I can't communicate across computers using any of the free available tools. I am well controlled and not flexible at all. There is no allignment with my needs or the goals of the truck (military) support teams.</description>

	<description>My priorities and job responsibilities are greatly impacted by the poor resolution I have encountered by the overseas IT group. The majority of the time they have trouble understanding exactly what the issue is. The time it takes to receive a call back from somoeone is impacting my group in a negative manner. Sometimes we do not receive any call back to our tickets. Follow up phone calls have to be made as tickets are sometimes closed and no one has called us or resolved the issue.</description>

	<description>"Our primary contacts and support teams are excllent.Overall, however, there is concern.  I'm not aware of all of the details of what ACHIVE might mean, but so far goals seem to include create a project-based IT organization and a support one.  This is dangerous as IT already is strongly distancing itself from it's customers through efforts like the IT Help Desk project and Planview, which are turning IT into a metrics-based and ticket-based organization rather than supporting business goals, objectives and priorities.  Those things are not quantifiable with ticket coutns."</description>

We should have banners up or put the mission statement in public places where we are all reminded constantly of what we are here for and how we need be more collaborative with the business.  IT has the worst Equipment and tools in the organization.  Consultants who are paid by the hour have the slowest PC's and there is no regular upgrade of Equipment.  The business typically has better tools than we do.  It's, quite frankly, embarrassing.  "</description>

	<description>"Some of the IT functions are not aligned with business goals, priorities, and objectives. For example, migrating from Ideas to NX and pulling away engineering resources to train and test and migrate and validate all the aspects that this effort merits. While the effort is one that will add value (potentially) the timing and implementation clash with major engine programs that are critical to the business as a corporation. The ""blue chips"" are not first (e.i. 0.2NoX engine programs fully resources), so we can offer EPA compliant engines to customers in 2012. Once these critical engine programs were fully resourced to maximize our return on investment, we are diluting resources by doing too much too soon. The planning was not well thought out."</description>

	<description>"Again, I am an AME employee, based in Melrose Park.  I called an IT employee in Indianapolis (AME headquarters) to ask to have AutoCAD 2010 installed.  He said, ""I don't service Melrose Park, you need to put in a ticket.  So I put in a ticket.  The Melrose Park IT person told me that AutoCAD 2010 was not an option available to me, so he attempted to install AutoCAD 2007.  The installation failed, so he had to reimage my computer.  Upon setting up all of my unique software and settings I had AutoCAD 2007.  The first drawing that a collegue sent me was based in AutoCAD 2010 so I couldn't open it.  I called back to the Melrose Park IT person and he said that I needed to call Indianapolis IT.  AFTER TWO WEEKS OF HEADACHE I CALLED THE SAME GUY THAT I CALLED IN THE FIRST PLACE.  He said, ""Oh, I guess I can send you the link.  60 seconds later I had a link and 3 hours later the install was done and I had a functioning version of AutoCAD 2010.  I am just trying to get my job done and IT is more concerned about following their own obstructive procedures than helping me be productive."</description>

	<description>"I don't think it is fair to generalize 'IT' as a whole. For the most part (95%), the people who I need to deal with in IT, it is very easy to do business with them. There are some that need alot of convincing that they need to do what the business is asking because of a business need for company employees. "</description>

Now, I have to call and get someone who does not have a command of the english language and struggle through issues. This takes time and there are times I will ask our local comp. wiz for assistance rather than fire up the overseas network (My opinion). Not only that we now share someone with coorporate who is not always here. However this person is very responsive to my needs and my hats off to him. I greatly appriciate the local contract IT individual as well."</description>

	<description>"IT is difficult to do business with.  A good share of my job and others in my area is helping to navigate these waters beause of this.*  Planview is not user friendly, difficult, and confusing.  The only portion that's clear is the charges that come back to us--that proces works well.*  The ""reconfigured"" Help Desk does not add significant value.  I frequently know and understand individuals who resolve issues IT, and then fix my issue before the ticket is even routed to them.*  The ""core technology"" areas (database, server, etc.) seem to be almost unresponsive to the other members of IT.  They seem to have no accountability or sharing in resovling the issues--again just care about ""working the ticket"".*  For new initiatives, finding individuals who can help outside of our core support teams is difficult.  *  IT seems understaffed in the areas of SharePoint, document management services, web design, web programming, and database analysts.  We cannot continue to rely on outside firms to help with these key technologies.* A prevailing notion seems to be that project execution is owned by IT.  The business should drive project execution."</description>

	<description>"IT personnel should communicate more frequently with their customers. I had put in a request to replace my desktop with my laptop and several of my emails requesting a status update went unanswered. I understand that there will be periodic delays with processing requests and responding to emails, but I still expect some sort of response containing status updates and explanations on the reasons for delays. Without a response, I don't even know if anyone from IT is working on the issue. I am a firm believer any businness entity should be proactive in discussing customer wants and needs, and that two-way dialogues are will enablers to delivering the best possible solutions.

	<description>"Planview is ""Pain View"". There is limited visibility to where requests are in the queue or expected target date for getting anything. The use of too many tools: 1)Maximo for help desk/fix it, 2) Planview for enhancements, 3) Phire for configuration/migrations...why so many tracking tools?  Business Partners don't look at the business at an enterprise level and are always looking to add to the portfolio of systems rather than reduce it. Too much talking out of both sides of the mouth (no SAP! ...Waukesha/Indy going to SAP!) IT is being outsourced and the employees that are left that know anything are being stretched very thin.

I strongly suggest that I be given the opportunity to sit down with the IT decision makers when I need something done and they approve IT to work on the project without the months of investigations and paperwork so that we can ultimately decide to do what I originally asked.</description>

	<description>"The Help Desk has not been a good experience on a few levels. I submitted a ticket in the last few months regarding an ODBC driver. The Help Desk person asked me to spell it and then got it wrong on the email follow-up. It would be wonderful if they had a bit more knowledge and were able to solve issues. We were told by the local IT person that was dispatched that they aren't supposed to do anything other than take information and do minimal tasks like resetting passwords.Given all the multitude of systems the various departments use, there is no way for a Help Desk person who doesn't even work for us to understand our problem. We need local business unit IT people that can be quickly deployed and are familiar with a particular business group. However, I know in our area that many, many of those people were cut in the last couple years."</description>

	<description>"The person responsible for our Oracle/Stellant issues is not always cooperative.  He is impatient and instead of helping to resolve problems he creates more.The language barrier for our outsourced help is frustrating.  It also slows down the process of getting issues resolved.  Often times they mark issues as resolved because they don't understand.  When screen shots and explanations of problems are sent and they have to pass on the problem to another support person they do not forward the entire e-mail so the new support person has to ask all the questions and get all the screen shots again.  This is time consuming for all.  "</description>

	<description>"The response time when calling/emailing the IT Sevice Desk is rather long, sometimes over 72 hours.  When you do reach someone, they do not seem to understand our systems, software, IT structure, etc.  This makes both parties involved very frustrated.  Often times tickets are not resolved timely and accurately, resulting in more tickets being created as they say it isn't related to the original ticket.  Once the ticket is escalated to company IT, the response time is quick and is resolved accurately the first time."</description>

Not sure what value the call personal provide all they do is take your information and you have to wait for your local IT personal to fix you issue. This is very aggravating that they cannot help you or do not even understand your complaint. The field and offsite personal do not have the ability to walk over to their local IT personal to get there computer fixed. </description>

If we have a question about our SR there is no one that we can talk to for an answer.  We are not notified if & when our problem is corrected.  However I have been questioned 2 months later if specific SR's have been completed because evidentally you don't know.

	<description>"As a new contract employee,I am still waiting for a resolution of my non-critical issue (setting up email accounts). I called the IT hotline and he tried to assist me but the matter was unresolved. I also tried the online helpdesk and was unable to get the information needed to set up my email accounts."</description>

	<description>"As a new hire, there were numerous programs not installed, and getting them were very time consuming and inefficient.  When the person on the other end of the phone doesn't know the word ""adobe"" and it is supposed to be an IT service desk, there is a bit of a problem.  The operators should at least have a little bit of knowledge so they are requesting the correct item in the ticket, especially since I would assume it is a service the IT team pays for. Additionally, all of the documents, etc. that need to be approved by my manager for each item was an inconvenience.  My coworker and I both replaced previous positions; we were not a created position.  It seems that our computers and accessibility could have been mirrored from the employees prior to us  permissions, for everything from SharePoint to company Connect to Web site accesses.

	<description>"As mentioned, I haven't had a good experience with the helpdesk in a very long time.  In one instance, I was trying to explain my problem and the man I was speaking with was degrading at best.  He was impatient and wouldn't listen to me. He made me very upset. Another instance I remember is calling and completely not understanding a word this person said. I asked to speak with someone else but that didn't happen. I finally convinced them to have someone here help me. Then I decided to try the web chat where you can type your question.  That wasn't any better. Just this morning I was having difficulty just logging on.  I shut down my computer 3 times, lost almost an hour of productivity, but would NOT call the helpdesk.  It is a big inconvenience dealing them.  9 times out 0f 10 you need someone here anyway.  So I call India or wherever, then I can't effectively communicate with them because of the language barrier, so they call someone here to help me.  Where does that make any sense? Others feel the same way, believe me.  I really hope they all express their feelings here like I am because it is a completely ineffective, non-value added way of doing business.  We may be saving dollars by using an alternative to a U.S based company on paper. If going to another country saves money, you need to make sure there is not this language barrier. It's totally frustrating! I think company really needs to re-evaluate this process or the company we are using because in my opinion someone needs to ask the question of how much productivity is being lost because of how bad this situation is.  I haven't heard one single positive experience with our helpdesk."</description>

	<description>"At TDTC this is a major failing.  At one time we had what I considered a very good support team.  Now, response is slow, ineffective and a huge frustration.  Call takers are many times hard to communitate with (end up spelling everything).  No way to escalate a problem.  Can wait weeks for something that should be a simple task.  This is a very important point of contact with the IT organization and it leaves a bad impression of IT."</description>

	<description>"I am a contract employee with an old loaner laptop (Dell D610) that completely crashed on the first day. Since repaired, I find it impossible to maintain connectivity or access due to anti-virus software that won't load, barriers to access normal Parts regions and difficulty resolving problems with Help Desk. I have resorted to using my own personal laptop to access e-mail through Web only. I have low expectations because I understand the limitations that large companies face but even so, I have been very disappointed."</description>

	<description>"I cringe every time I have to call the help desk. I dislike the outsourced service people who answer the calls.  I find them very difficult to work with.  They have a hard time determining what my needs are, and communicating with them is very difficult. They usually have to redirect my issue, as they have no idea how to resolve it.  I find the outsourced people are NOT helpful at all and I spend way too much time on the phone with them trying to help them instead of them helping me.  Our internal help desk is wonderful!  I would like to be directly connected to them for all issues.  They resolve issues easily and correctly.  "</description>

	<description>"I have been on calls and there is a definite language barrier.  When the work order got to the IT person on site, it was totally different thatn what was said on the call.  We have backed up 10 years with the help desk.  No one uses it because it is horrible.  Also,  server restarts from India is the worst idea ever.  We lost more than 2 hours of production time trying to get servers restarted.  My IT guys locally used to do it and now they are not allowed to for some reason.  "</description>

However I had an emergency at 8:30 PM - all of my files disappeared and I was finalizing a proposal that was due to the customer the following morning. All the help desk was able to do was input an issue ticket. I wasn't contacted about that work ticket until the next afternoon. Luckily when I got into the office and logged on via the docking station, all of my files were accessable. It was a couple days later that I was contacted about having my files restored.  With our electronic world, we cannot wait three days to restore files!"</description>

It is not saving us money to spend hours on the phone with the help desk each month.</description>

It's amazing how little communication there's been on some major outages that might impact 1000's of users, such as the more than 3 hour whole company internet outage on 6/14/11 that broke myriad internal applications also that are dependent on the internet."</description>

	<description>"IT service calls take an excessive amount of time to enter by phone, due to the absimal level of English proficiency of staff at the call center.  I have to explain the most simple situaion a minimum of two or three times, before the call handler is able to comprehend and enter the ticket.  Once the ticket is actually entered, it has consistently taken 72 or more hours, for the ticket to be acknowledged or worked on.  Finally, IT ""lost"" one of my tickets in the past 12 months, never assigned it to anyone, and never worked on it. I had to call back twice to get work started on it."</description>

	<description>"I've have to contact the help desk a lot over that past year.  Sometimes it very hard to understand what the person is saying.  Example - A week ago Monday I called the help desk to see if there were problems with the external website.  I had to give my user-id about 9 times and the person still got it wrong.  I gave A as in Apple, B as in Basket, C as in Cat and they still could not get it.  I asked the person if they could let me know if there was an issue with the external website and I could not get an answer until they got my user-id right.  The call was about 10 minutes long and I was finally told there was a problem with the site I was trying to get.  My user-id was not needed to answer the question.  This is just one example."</description>

	<description>"Last week, I requested that an intern obtain access to three things: a shared drive, access to our website, and ability to scan documents on a printer on our floor.  He was given access to the shared drive in a prompt manner and I received confirmation.  However, regarding the website, I received confirmation that he was set up properly, but he was not set up because he couldn't log in--he eventually received access, but it was an extra couple days later.  In addition, no confirmation email was sent letting us know he was properly set up after the follow-up request.  The only reason we knew he was set up properly is because he successfully tried to log in.  As for him being able to scan on the local printer, it appears as though someone tried setting him up, but it was not set up properly.  Apparently someone is still working on this, and it has been a week later.  In addition to this employee, I requested that a National Account Manager receive access to our website on 5/9/2011 but I never received confirmation from anyone and once again it wasn't until the user was able to log in that we found out he did have access.

Somehow the org. changed and it was not very responsive even though I am sure all of the boxes got checked to say everyone did a good job. It used to be that we could take an issue to a local real person and have the issue addressed right now. Now it goes into essentially into a black hole...which is good foe the IT dept. as they can show how many resources were saved...I ended up solving my own problems after much struggle...but the ""new"" process worked...resources of the IT dept. were saved!!!! and they were credited!!

	<description>Opened ticket for hardware issue (or problem) on Friday morning.  Received confirmation immediately then an ote from someone in IBM support asking if it's been resolved and if not to contact them immediately.  I explained I just opened the ticket and didn't think it could have been resolved right away.  no reply.  On Monday morning the monitor was working fine so I cancelled the ticket.  On Tuesdeay I was contacted by someone to schedule an appointment to correct the monitor.  Then they wrote back and cancelled the ticket. </description>

	<description>"The Help Desk personnel act more as secretaries, but do not take proper notes when creating a ticket. They ask a lot of questions and do not put down the responses on the ticket. I find that I have to repeat the same responses at least two or three times for every ticket if it is not a simple issue, and then repeat it yet again when the on-site IT person contacts me. This is even more so an issue when using the IT Chat function. The IT Help person on the chat should copy the conversation and attach it to the ticket to prevent the conversation from being wasted time.This would be a more functional business practice for IT.Also, I have noticed an increasing communication barrier when calling the Help Desk, but it is not on my end. I can understand them even with heavy accents, but most do not seem to be able to do the same or do not understand a lot of the IT issues and concepts. This adds three to five minutes to any conversation when the person does not readily understand and has I have to repeat the issue several times before it seems to click. I am not sure if this is a language barrier issue or a call center lack of industry knowledge, but it takes time away from my projects. "</description>

	<description>"The IT Service Desk has lacked some responsiveness, constantly assigned tickets incorrectly (even when specifying the correct group when opening the ticket), or simply ignored tickets.  The internal solution is to simply avoid the Service Desk and go directly to the group to get the work done and then open a ticket at the same time.  At this point in time this is the most effecient route unfortunately."</description>

	<description>"The IT service desk is a terrible experience.  You cannot understand them and they cannot understand me.  They consistantly do the wrong thing when asking them for help, if they help you.  Seems like they just create tickets for the IT employee's in the company to do the work.  Once the IT department has received the ticket (can be hours or days) the ticket is worked on and usually taken care of in a timely manner.  Why would company put a block in place of going directly to the IT department you know will fix the issue?  It's time consuming and very frustrating on my part.  My co workers also say the IT service desk is a joke.  A huge joke on company.  Who approved this change and why does it continue to be this way?  Open your eyes management."</description>

	<description>"The IT Service Desk is merely a ""messenger service"" and I spend more time spelling my name, my position, my ID # and name than we do on the problem itself---communication by the India based representatives is very poor at best and they merely make-out tickets and pass the issue/problem thru to the local IT Tech support in my facility."</description>

	<description>"The response time when calling/emailing the IT Sevice Desk is rather long, sometimes over 72 hours.  When you do reach someone, they do not seem to understand our systems, software, IT structure, etc.  This makes both parties involved very frustrated.  Often times tickets are not resolved timely and accurately, resulting in more tickets being created as they say it isn't related to the original ticket.  Once the ticket is escalated to company IT, the response time is quick and is resolved accurately the first time."</description>

	<description>"For example I requested that plotter ink be replaced and received a call a 8 days later concerning whether it was taken care of.  So much for timeliness.  I almost always send and email rather than try to explain the situation on the phone because it is nearly not understood even when it is a very simple straightforward situation.  Even when I sent a recent request the email message was misinterpreted to mean just the oppositite of what was written.  This would have not happened if they spoke English or understood it better.Overall I try to avoid using the help desk and only as a last result and definitely cannot expect timely responses.I have little confidence in the Help desk.  They are very polite and professional and pleasant to deal with."</description>

	<description>"It is understandable that to cut costs, jobs are shipped overseas for pennies on the dollar.  With that, quality has decreased as we tend to get what we pay for and that is understandable.  The problem comes in with speaking with people on the other end who simply could care less, they have no drive or interest in what they are doing.  Server Admins who suggest ""adding space"" to servers which will not solve any problems, DBA's who simply ignore requests (until Sev 2 is opened), and tickets which are emailed and documented...but are never acknowledged or opened."</description>

	<description>"Yes, overall I am ok with the final results when I do report an issue.  However, usually when I call the help desk, they end up referring my ticket back to someone locally, so I don't really understand why we have to first call India (it is difficult to understand the techs who answer calls from India) to get someone here at WHQ to help us. That seems counterproductive as well as annoying.  I believe these jobs should remain in the U.S."</description>

	<description>"You are just trying to hire the lowest priced people from India that you can find.  You are not Patriotic to the United States and are only interested in your own selfish bottom line.  You want to make money off of the USA without a commitment to keeping its people employed.  When IBM hires workers to work within here at our facility the USA to do IT work, all too often it hires foreigners to do it.  Your outsourcing work is not appriciated. Indians located in India and New Delhi are hard to understand and at the end of many calls the answer is either ""You will have to reboot"" which I could have done myself in a half hour's less time, or ""I will write a ticket so your local IT person can stop by to help."" Pathetic."</description>

It is very hard to fully understand the problems sometimes and do not do a good job of relaying the information up to the higher tiers.  I will almost live or try to solve the problem myself before spending 3 hours on the phone with the help desk, for them to finally say I can't help you and will forward this ticket up.  I could keep going on, but will stop here! "</description>

	<description>"Almost all issues are solved by local IT people, yet we still have to call the hotline.  The hotline people rarely understand the issue and are little more than receptionists for the local IT group.  I will say that the local IT group are adept for the most part, but seem understaffed as response time is lacking.Another major issue I have is the poor access to software tools.  Other companies I have worked for have a website where employees can search a list of available software then simply click on the tool they need and the software will automatically install.  If the software is restricted, the website will automatically bring up an approval form which will be emailed to the appropriate parties for approval.  Once approval is given, simply go back to the website and download the software.  This system is so simple and efficient, and no human IT employee has to touch a computer for software install (other than troubleshooting).  When I first started here, I had to wait two weeks for two items of software that are necessary for my job.  And I'm not near the only individual that has had this issue."</description>

	<description>"Although there are some wonderful, helpful people in the IT organization, it seems that overall, anything that has been done to ""improve"" the organization has made things more difficult all around.  Finding how to access a program, a site, a software, is the most painful of processes.  There is guidance to only the highest level of needs, and then extremely little.  As a whole, it seems IT is made up of unnecessary people hanging on with no value, people who don't know what they're doing, and a few really great, helpful, knowledgeable people."</description>

	<description>"As a new employee, it is critical to be up and running with Equipment as quickly as possible.  Joe Marten was very persistent in getting me the Equipment I needed to do my job right away.  I would suggest a new hire form location for things like access to systems, cellular requests, etc. so that some of the time spent looking for that information or asking around can be spent more productively."</description>

	<description>As a relatively new employee (6 months) my experience has been that using other people's personal contacts is by far the most effective way of getting any focussed support. I received no helpful support from IT in terms of company IT processes and policies. In particular I am amazed that I have never been given any instruction or training relating to data security and backups which considering how much company confidential and proprietary data is available on individual's laptops is a major weakness. I did order a local back up drive when I originally ordered my laptop but to date (6 months later) there has been no sign of it or follow up.</description>

	<description>"As I noted, calling the service desk for issues creates an inconvenience.  Many IT team members would rather email back and forth several times then come to the desk or call and work it out. I understand that some issues may be solved easily by logging on remotely, but some would be quicker to just be more willing to come to the desk.  That being said, I had a major issue with Adobe, and Ed Durham, in particular, was EXTREMELY helpful.  He has checked up on me for issues every once in a while ever since.  It helps having someone I know I can go to. He is a great person for your team! Also, there seems to be a bit of a gap if people do resolve an open issue, and when it gets closed.  Sometimes it gets done, and I get contacted later with someone thinking its open, and sometimes it gets closed before it is resolved.  I am guessing it would help internally with checking efficiency if this was monitored more closely. I think Lisle would be an easier move if the IT team makes sure to be open to temporarily move away from the 'ticket' way of solving issues.  People are already cranky about the move, so the fewer things to give them to complain about, the better. "</description>

	<description>"At what time do we become innovated in our approach to IT service?  We follow what is now an ""old"" trend to reduce cost by outsourcing.  When is our IT going to be thinking ahead, instead of following industry practices that become outdated (like Achieve), before the plan is executed?  Typical IH/ITEC/company slow & clumsy thinking (IH get out of Scout - claiming, ""SUVs won't sell""; then company produces the CXT at a time when oil/gas price soar, then they go into outsourcing IT 'late in the game' - at a time when ""more customized service"" is now the future)."</description>

	<description>"From what has been stated from those in IT about ACHIEVE, there is strong cause for concern.  The individuals in IT are very concerned about their jobs go forward.  The group seems demoralized by all of the changes that have occured over the past two years which all have been perceived as negative to the group and it's customers (re-badging, Planview, IT Help Desk) and ACHIEVE introduces yet another change.Furthermore, from what I understand on the ACHIEVE model (support organization vs. project-based), it will create a ""have"" and ""have not"" environment.  The support area suffers because it does not learn new skills and work on interesting projects and is paid less, and deals with disgruntled customers; the project-based area gets all the focus and more pay and happier customers.  If the support group is to be outsourced, no one internally is happy with the service levels from outsourced organizations becuase they are not in contact with us or share accountability for our goals.  Outsourcing almost always never works because it takes 2x-3x longer for them to accomplish the work.  I have personally seen this model implemented in two companies, with the results being not good, and the one causing another complete restructure 5 years later.IT seems to be moving towards a ticket-based, metrics-based environment and true ignoring customer service, which seems to being only be futhered by ACHIEVE.  This is a bit contrary to the relationship-based values of company.  True customer service will not show up in ticket counts.  We also need to employ individuals locally within our company rather than rely on outside firms to help us.  We know our business best--not consulting firms, and certainly not outsource providers.  Our interactions with these firms has been very costly with very mixed results and have proven to be very costly."</description>

	<description>"Getting service orders written is usually a slow and somtimes cumbersome process. Having to call the support line to spend time explaining to them what the problem is, just so they can write a service order so I can spend more time explaining to the tech what the issue is, seems redundant. There also seems to be a shortage of personal to provide service when something goes down. The service personal are very helpful, once they get to you but that often takes a while."</description>

Thankfully, someone already fixed the problem or the server came back on line, but the ""front line"" people clearly don't know our systems or their performance status. "</description>

	<description>"I am disappointed with Middle Managment and the way it views and treats the workers (assets)of the organization; I thought our core values included more than just ""Customer Focus"".  Where is the ""Communication"", ""Accountabilty"", ""Respect for People"", ""Speed Simplicity Agility"", ""Innovation"", & ""Relentless Pursuit of Quality in ALL we do""?I see hints of the values in the EC but it is not reflected by ALL of the Middle Managers or Team Leads, yet they remain in the status quo and continue to lead to the disengagment of good employees who are to burnt out to care any longer, and treated like troublemakers for pointing out any issues.  And since this is negative I can only expect it to be dismissed as an unimportant complaint.  Given the appropriate forum (without fear of retribution) others would most likely agree as this is based upon what I have heard as well as ""felt"" myself."</description>

	<description>"I am not sure why this survey was written this way.  'IT,' is a moniker that can suggest different things to different people.I have found certain people within the Local IT Help Desk organization to be very easy to deal with, willing to provide assistance and very flexible.  Getting to them via India has been a less than desireable experience.In terms of IT providing hardware, I find we are using adequately good material. It's not the best or fastest, but it works.In terms of IT providing basic software (OS, Office, Hypersnap, UG, etc...) It works, however its 2011 and we are still using office 2007.  In terms of IT providing specific, non-enterprise level software/database solutions, IT has fallen flat.  There seems to be no mechanism (or desire) to help small groups with their needs.  I can provide specific examples, should the need arise to contact me.In general, IT may be doing an excellent job at a very high level.  We can take a truck order, convert it to POs to suppliers, route parts across the globe, build vehicles, back flush material, invoice dealers, etc...  but we can't provide a decent project management tool to track quality issues, or we cannot provide a system that ties all Workflow business applications (pixys, PCBL, APCN, Release, WA, etc..) together automatically.

	<description>"I am worried that the model of sending IT support off-shore frightens me.  It is extremely valuable having someone on site that we can build a relationship with, that knows our systems, and can suggest improvements.I'd also like IT to push for one source of all people data.  There are way too many people data systems that don't talk to each other.  For example, Data Security has their own system and the Melrose system doesn't talk to the WHQ system, so a Melrose employee has to be given a visitor badge when at WHQ (I would think an employee is an employee).  I think it would be better if all people (employees, contractors, consultants, POI, etc.) should be in PeopleSoft and that system should feed every other system."</description>

	<description>"I don't think IT will ever get a superior rating because today's technology changes too fast and transistions to new processes are always difficult.  Also, ridiculous budget restrictions on enhancements to existing systems force the business to do constant work-arounds to manage everything while new systems are being designed.  Our IT organization cannot keep up with all of the needs of our expanding business initiatives.  The push to grow the company to a $20 billion Company is forcing new ways of doing business, to which IT could not possibly respond in the time frame needed.  I'm glad I am not a member of the IT group.  "</description>

But relative to my previous organization, I have had lots of issues here.I was a contract employee here in 2004-2006 and hired back direct in August 2010.  I have been in Fort Wayne the entire time until recently relocating to the Sara Lee building.I am available to discuss any of these issues."</description>

	<description>"I feel that outsourcing our IT Dept. is one of the biggest mistakes this company has made. It may be cost effective from the company's standpoint but it is not people effective from my standpoint or for my department. When something is not done correctly we have to keep putting tickets in to have someone come over and resolve our issues. Also,it is very clear that the plant has priority over our location. It sometimes takes several days for someone to come over and give us the help we need. To me that is not acceptable. In my opinion Parts should have its own IT department with people from this company that understands our processes and not some outside company."</description>

	<description>I feel that the current IT department is slow and does not anticipate the needs of the business. We should not have to call around the world to get local assistance. A lot of cases there are simple things like printer toner and ink cartridges that we have to wait weeks on end for. The process for getting new software installed is ridiculously long and I feel it does not contribute well to the needs of the business. </description>

	<description>I find it ironic that when you dial 6666 and it asked you to select 1 for english and the person you get on the phone to help you can only speak broken english at it best. The group in Inday (I guess) is only helpful about 50% of the time the other they have to kick it to someone else (local team).  That brings on another issue.  Ever since the local team was made IBM employees that have had a worse attitude than when they were company employees (and it was not great then).  All they try and do now is shuck responsibility.  Every time you go to them now you hear a 30 minute speach on how they are not company employees blah blah blah.  The corporate IT made this change and did not even look at what each plants IT team did.  Then they changed the on site employee to IBM and now they can't do all of what they were doing before.  Who is suppose to take over thier responsibilities now.  Everyone in this plant has plenty of responsibility right now and you have an outside vendor (IBM) trying to give you more work.  I am not pleased with this.</description>

	<description>I have had a few instances of dealing with IT. Some of the simple things such as setting up my printer or password changes etc... have been dealt with wonderfully. But I had a very important instance where the program I work in for my department had a failure and it took IT a very long time to correct it. In fact others in my department helped me fix the problem because IT was taking so long to get back with me. They seemed very unorganized and I believe the main reason for this was the possible overseas or seperate locations of the people I was dealing with. It seemed like no one wanted to take the initiative to help fix the problem which in tern was a very simple solution for them to do. I work in the warranty department and process claims.Tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars pass through my terminal weekely and I was down for about 4 days. Also because I am required to have my name signature on everything I do through my login it was impossible for me to work on someone elses computer. My managers also tried as hard as they could to speed up the process but were also met with resistance. I thought this was an important topic to be made aware of because of the time and money lost do to the IT personel I was dealing with. I believe it would have been fixed within hours if I had simply been put on a priority list to be handled ASAP. I hope this may help in your survey and future choices. Thank you</description>

	<description>"I have only one comment in our IT direction:The decision to move Uptime Parts QAD environment to be hosted externally at a QADvendor location was very confusing and frustrating. The technical and business case that was presented did not seem to be the best solution. I provided alterative solutions that would leverage existing infrastructure and consolidate Workhorse & Uptime Parts QAD environments. However, my proposal was not reviewed thoroughly by any of the teams to evaluate if this proposal was any cost saving for company. From the responses I received, it appeared that the decision to outsource had been made before the proposals were put together. Outsourcing the QAD application was quoted as 1 Million dollars, which is a biginvestment in an environment that is not strategic (long term). Even more concerning is that we would not own the QAD/Infrastructure with this deal, and I believe that when the time comesto finally migrate QAD to a replacement platform, we will again need to pay to the external vendors. The proposal I have provided would have saved infrastructure cost for both the business units and the QAD maintenance & licensing cost by half. This was very disappointing that no one was able to see this cost justification. OR at least, no one explained to me in a logical way why my proposal did not make the most sense."</description>

	<description>"I think IT does a great job given the cards it is handed.  Thigns we (Business + IT) can do better:Prioritize and budget IT initiatives. I am now seeing evidence of a more disciplined approach of IT project portfolio management.Business support!  There are two areas where we need improvement.  The business providning SME's to launch a project as well as business resources to support an application and process after it has launched.  Too many times we launch an application, htere are no admin/support/training support resrouces in place to manage the process and ensure the data is credible.  Without this support we either do not use software to its potential, or the dtaa in our systems is not credible.I appreciate the strategic efforts of Tom Hupp and Frank Dudley in driving for more Enterprise applications like Teamcenter."</description>

	<description>"I understand having all requests routed through the IT Sevice Desk is for efficiency.  However, it does not feel efficient for the customer.  The response time is too long.  Once I get to the IT person who can help me, I have found the service to be great.  There have been system issues to deal with that could not be resolved timely but I know IT has taken steps to improve the response time in the future.  I also worked with IT members on system enhancements.  I found them knowledgeable and helpful.  It has been a tough year working through the system issues but I do see progress and feel that overall IT does a good job."</description>

IT and PLM infrastructure is painfully slow and does not seem to be what the vendor (Siemens) recommends or supports. FORD and GM have way more simultanious users of Teamcenter, they utilize it's capabilities much better and it works great. NOT HERE. Very frustrating. And, Sea Change does not have a clue how to achieve this either. IT support can be a major Black Hole. NO enforced service-level-agreement on response. Unacceptable at other compaines. Be careful when the ""competition"" figures out how to do basic IT/PLM. "</description>

	<description>"IT is still a collection of fairly independent departments with no clear/strong Enterprise-Wide Focus and Strategy.The current leaders through director level are not change-agent type leaders. They cannot lead IT to get to the next level. They have no experience with positive change and am not sure they can learn how to do that quick enough. Change has to come from the top down. We don't have time for bottoms up change. Fear-based leadership is also very evident. Change-Agents take risks and are comfortable challenging the statue quo. IT does not have those type of leaders.

	<description>"IT realistically runs on the shoulders of the few people who have not been outsourced yet.  In having conducted interviews for company, many of the IT managers themselves would not be able to pass basic technical questions which results ""disconnected"" people making important technical decisions.  There is and has been a need to change IT, no question about that.  In the immediate quest to save money (and at the end of the day its all about the money), part of the soul of IT has been lost.  We can produce as many charts or graphs as we like or move folks around or shift to outside vendors, however the most important thing that can't be done is to get someone who works for another company to care."</description>

The process for on-boarding a new employee as it relates to IT  3.  Review of the forms or websites were requests need to be submitted and more detailed info can be found.  Also understanding when certain forms need to be used - i.e. EURs etc.   Our new Manager was not aware of these until I had several discussions with the IT Help Desk to figure out the issues. If this type of training is already on the University website, Managers should be required to take the class when they first begin employment."</description>

	<description>"Let me be clear that my issues with the 800# IT group is not due to the fact that they are foreign as we are a diverse company and I can appreciate that. My disappointment is with the level of service and inability for them to correctly log tickets, to resolve the issue themselves, or for them to actually forward in a timely manner the ticket to someone who can contact me back in less than 24 hours. Each time there has been a survey like this I have provided specific examples of situations that I have encountered with the 800# IT group. The problems are not being resolved with them and the level of service has not improved at all. Others have told me they don't fill out these surveys because they feel the issues won't be addressed and they don't want to spend the extra time to report their specific experiences."</description>

	<description>"company has chosen to conduct much of its business through electronic communication. However, its IT department is a very poor support service. It's service is not timely, very hard to access, confused and wholly inadequeate. If company intends to do business electronically, it needs to provide its employees much better technical support than it is providing today. An employee with an IT problem can wait days for assistence, and when it comes, most likely, the IT person does not understand the issue or solve the problem. We need an IT change immediately."</description>

	<description>"The amount of time it takes to get resolution started is the main problem that I see. Once someone has an understanding of what is needed to be done, it is relatively fast. I would prefer to contact someone locally rather than to try to speak another language with an operator who is obviously in another country and doesn't know our systems here at this building very well.

These Gate Ways are set up when software is intially loaded.  Connection issues occur with the company issued Laptop and the first thing IT would like to do is reload the software package.  These company Software Service Tools have one time use passwords issued at the time of purchase.  The software can only be loaded once on one Laptop.

	<description>The Help Desk is often an ordeal. The customre service people are in India and have a list of 20 canned questions that you must go thru just to open a ticket. They arenot capable of trouble shooting or resolving the issues but you still have to spend 10-15 minutes with them so they can write a profile.  Can we streamline the process?  Many of the workers try hard but have thick accents and are hard to understand. </description>

	<description>"The IT service desk expereince is generally poor.  There seems to be a lot of time wasted communicating with the service desk the issue.  This tends to drive the majority of users from contacting the service desk and taking their issues directly to the local support personnel.  Tickets seem to get routed incorrectly or not at all many times.  The offshore EDI team is difficult to work with, although they have been knowledgable and helpful, their working hours are not aligned with the typical US first shift and there has been days wasted trying to communicate back and forth resolving issues becuase of the difference in working hours.  The offshore server support for non ITAR servers is difficult to work with, doesn't seem to show any urgency to outages, and has been non-resonsive to service requests at times."</description>

	<description>"The IT Team has exceptionally good people and they are most enjoyable to work with.  They are very supportive and want to do a great job.   However,  I get the impression old systems prevent us from implementing ideas and moving the business forward.  For example, TOLAS stabilization has absorbed most resources and we are not allowed to focus on future opportunities as there is a fear that changing code in TOLAS will add more to system instability.   IT is clearly critical to our success and needs to become an even stronger partner going forward."</description>

The local IT people were clueless when it came to setting up my new computer....sound not working, spaceball not working, multiple programs missing, missing drivers, & slow response time from them. They didnt know where my new computer was that was being delivered to me, I had to go hunt it down myself. They are a generally hard to deal with. Some of the people from IBM Helpdesk are hard to understand. One time, it took 90 minutes to get someone logged on to Online Helpdesk Chat. There were a couple of times when tickets were closed before or while the problem was being fixed. "</description>

	<description>"This is the worst I.T. experience I've had wherever I've worked, mostly due to the fact that they should never have oursourced such an important function as I.T. overseas.  It is INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING to the average user, when they have to go through the HelpDesk.Last year, I.T. hosted a discussion with admins at WHQ, and there were MANY questions.  They promised to get back to admins with the answers, and - several months later - we STILL don't have the answers.  Also...I gave one of the presenters my business cards and asked her to call me for some feedback & discussion - she said she would - and never even bothered to call.  That was months ago.  That is, frankly, unacceptable."</description>

	<description>"Two issues with IT:  Lack of understanding (person not understanding what I'm saying and me not understanding what the person is saying) when I'm patched through to India for help.  Having to say ""pardon me"" over and over and over is somewhat embarrassing and time consuming and also the person not understanding my explanation of the problem is a real hindrance to solving my issue.  Also, timing of receiving help is another problem.  For example, someone in my group sent a job order to our network printer one morning and for some reason it wouldn't print and he was unable to delete the print job from his print queue.  Becase of this, the printer wasn't printing anything anyone in my group sent to the printer. I sent an e-mail to the service desk late morning (instead of calling and wasting time trying to explain to someone in India) and of course was informed that it would take 4 hours or more to have someone get back to me to resolve the issue.  Well, our group went without a printer the whole day and by the next day the problem resolved itself on its own before we ever got a response back from the service desk.  Wished there was someone in IT we could call in the building who could just help us out quickly with a problem like this but understand that times have changed and people are not available for this type of help anymore.

	<description>"When calling the IT Help desk i can get rather impatient. If there are issues with a system, I have to hear the announcement/problem before I can proceed to the options. Often, it appears that the technicians/engineers on the other end sound like they are talking rather slowly and verifying information before I can proceed to the concern I have. I haven't timed it, but waiting for the opportunity to voice your issue can take near a minute. A minute surely doesn't sound like a long time, but if you imagine sitting in silence for that time before you can speak. I simply am noticing these steps before I have a chance to share the reason for the call."</description>

	<description>"When IT is mentioned, I believe this to be company employed personnel and not accenture support desk.  Our whole world is spinning because of the whole ticket system.  For example.  I have to create a Svc Req which can only be a 3 or 4 priority.  Then it may get cancelled and get replaced by an incident or eventually a change request.  the process is long and drawn out and keeping track of them is not easy.  no one provides any feedback unless you hound them and even that does not help becuase we are understaffed.  too many cheifs and not enough indians.  it takes an act of God to get anything done.  communicating with people in a differnt country adds another whole dimension - sometimes like being in the twilight zone.  If we speak english, then we should have people who are working on our issues who have good control over the english language.  some of my issues have taken an extrodinarily long timne to complete because of the language barrier.  I do not see any regression testing going on when changes are put in and sometimes it appears that things that have been fixed revert back to being broken after subsequent fixes are imiplemented.  Also, there does not seem to be a real sense of urgency.  "</description>

	<description>"When we call for help language barriers are sometimes an issue. When a problem is called in that first group hands it off to another group while they pat themselves on the back and send you a survey asking how you liked their service.  I did not like it because my problem was still not resolved.  Example, I had a bad printer.  Called it in to 1300. They said they would pass it onto the local team.  Local team comes looks at it and says printer broken we are passing onto outside printer repair people. Printer repair say printer is broken not repairable.  At this point I have talked to 3 groups each who has told me the printer is broken.  I start getting surveys about the service.  Well, I am not really happy with the service because I still could not print after dealing with 3 different groups.  By the time it was all said and done I was at least a month without a printer.  A couple days I could see but not a month.  This is probably the worst case example I have so far but I would just add that very rarely do I have a positive experience when I call for IT help. I think IT is supposed to be a service organization but I really give the IT help process and results very low grades.  I think it was better when you were dealing with someone locally from start to finish.  There was a relationship between IT and the customer and the IT person had ownership of the issue.  Now it is a pass the buck as fast as you can process."</description>

	<description>"Why am I required to dial 3880? The people there are of no use. When I am locked out of a AS400 (password issue) the 1st response is usually: ""...I'm sorry, your user ID is not supposed to be activated at this time... or some such mess. When I push for a response that makes sense I am placed on hold for what seems like 3 minutes.  After I insist on knowing the issue, I get access. The folks at the ""helpdesk"" don't understand issues such as system lockup, and want to ask, what are the other issues? There is one person there who is knowledgeable and professional; unfortunately, I cannot remember his name.  When something goes wrong, I do not dial 3880 first; I reboot until something fixes itself, which can be discouraging and is definitely unproductive."</description>
