"Here, in the IT department, at Monaco RV, many of our tasks/projects are isolated from the larger Navistar IT department but there have been some areas that Navistar has taken over or partnered with our department.  From my position as a DBA I see the main business value provided now to our department is the certainty and security that we can weather the storms which can be of great value in actual work product because people will and can focus more on their work.  Also, while certain areas have been absorbed by the parent IT department, many of the services provided by our department are enhanced by the addition of people and the corporate oversight that comes with being a part of Navistar."</a>

"I don't think the current ticket creation process (by calling 1300) is value added. Often I have to call up 1300 and explain the issue, more often than not, this ticket is forwarded to the local support team. The ticket that is sent to the local support team often includes a very brief description of the issue, so I have to take time to explain the issue all over to the onsite support person. There used to a option to go online and create tickets using a web based interface, and this process was far more efficient. A web based tool for ticket creation and status tracking will be value added. "</a>

When key people help with minor IT projects outside of the official approval process to get IT help then it is clear that IT has great capability and can be a huge help.  When the IT project approval process has to be involved then projects that should take a few days end up taking months or years.</a>

New systems , security and funneling in information from other sources to support the unending need for more information get exceedingly more tme consuming.

"Big issues with planview process.  Requests are submitted and stay in submittal status until you ping someone.  No one seems measured on how many requests are assigned to them, time to resolve.  Requests are submitted, and aren't discussed with appropriate BRCL representation - requests are assigned to who works on the app, not the business person who submitted request.  The submitter might not be on BRCL that reviews request.  Many definitions within planview aren't defined and are up to users discretion when allocating time so metrics will be bogus.  When I am teaching a class, should I enter it as non-project training, group communications, or some other bucket.  If management doesn't define it, you can automate planview routing all you want but still not improve it."</a>

"Out local IT staff is excellent, even after they were out sourced to IBM they have continued to provide whatever service is within the scope of their contract. HOWEVER, the IT Corporate Leadership is obviously out of touch with the facilities and the concept that Navistar makes trucks.  We continually see length communications from the IT Management spewing a bunch of high level buzz words and making bold claims about cost savings, efficiency, etc... yet we never see any of it actually become fact."</a>

"The only reason I am choosing 4 is because every company needs an IT department.  I believe our is soarly lacking.  If they'd start making wiser decisions about the software they have us use.  Peoplesoft is just about the worst program/software that I have ever used.  To look up a PO in Project Phoenix you end up with 3 internet sessions running?  I know it's not called Project Phoenix, but that is what I know it as (or Oracle). Then when you open it you get a security warning of some sort, but it's okay to continue???  I don't know, but that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. It seems as though there's alway ""band-aids"" or quick fixes put in place.  My biggest concern is when they replace the pricing system and then TOLAS.  What band-aids will we need for that?"</a>

The people at the 800# are not only hard to understand at times but also lack the ability to properly understand what the issue is when I call most of the times. Tickets have been issued with the wrong description and issues not resolved with 1 phone call. In May I called twice about 2 separate issues & advised the person I was working from home & needed to be called back on my cell phone. 4 times the 800# person told me that someone would call my office number about the issue even after I told them I wasn't in the office & to only reference my cell phone number. For the one issue someone in local IT contacted my office number & got my manager's ph# from my voice mail & called him about my ticket. My manager was unaware of the issue & therefore the ticket was not resolved. For the 2nd example I again told the 800# person I was out of the office & needed to be called on my cell phone. 3 days later I received an email from an internal IT person asking me to contact him about my issue. I questioned why no one had called me at home as I requested on the ticket when I called on 5/23. He replied that there was no home or cell ph# listed on the ticket. I am very disappointed at the 800# people. This is just a couple examples of the problems I have experienced. When you ask around everyone says the only time they call the 800# is if absolutely needed as it is a waste of time as issues are not resolved due to lack of response or the person at the 800# doesn't understand the issue & issue a ticket appropriately.</a>

Sometimes I get emails again weeks later after ticket number is assigned - it was routed to someone else, issue was resolved, but never closed out.  Why wait 3-4 weeks to ask if it's been resolved instead of sooner?  Are there any SLAs in place that are aligned with when we need it resolved by?

"Some of the IT functions are not aligned with business goals, priorities, and objectives. For example, migrating from Ideas to NX and pulling away engineering resources to train and test and migrate and validate all the aspects that this effort merits. While the effort is one that will add value (potentially) the timing and implementation clash with major engine programs that are critical to the business as a corporation. The ""blue chips"" are not first (e.i. 0.2NoX engine programs fully resources), so we can offer EPA compliant engines to customers in 2012. Once these critical engine programs were fully resourced to maximize our return on investment, we are diluting resources by doing too much too soon. The planning was not well thought out."</a>

"Again, I am an AME employee, based in Melrose Park.  I called an IT employee in Indianapolis (AME headquarters) to ask to have AutoCAD 2010 installed.  He said, ""I don't service Melrose Park, you need to put in a ticket.  So I put in a ticket.  The Melrose Park IT person told me that AutoCAD 2010 was not an option available to me, so he attempted to install AutoCAD 2007.  The installation failed, so he had to reimage my computer.  Upon setting up all of my unique software and settings I had AutoCAD 2007.  The first drawing that a collegue sent me was based in AutoCAD 2010 so I couldn't open it.  I called back to the Melrose Park IT person and he said that I needed to call Indianapolis IT.  AFTER TWO WEEKS OF HEADACHE I CALLED THE SAME GUY THAT I CALLED IN THE FIRST PLACE.  He said, ""Oh, I guess I can send you the link.  60 seconds later I had a link and 3 hours later the install was done and I had a functioning version of AutoCAD 2010.

I am currently involved in a miserable print inventory project with a 3rd party (compucom) hired by a 3rd party (Xerox) hired by a 3rd party (IBM). They have no clue how to obtain configurations for our Equipment & we have no local IT only huntvill. I could have planned to have someone travel here & support this but was not told clearly that a print config on each unit would be required. </a>

The only portion that's clear is the charges that come back to us--that proces works well.*  The ""reconfigured"" Help Desk does not add significant value.  I frequently know and understand individuals who resolve issues IT, and then fix my issue before the ticket is even routed to them.*  The ""core technology"" areas (database, server, etc.) seem to be almost unresponsive to the other members of IT.  They seem to have no accountability or sharing in resovling the issues--again just care about ""working the ticket"".*  For new initiatives, finding individuals who can help outside of our core support teams is difficult.  *  IT seems understaffed in the areas of SharePoint, document management services, web design, web programming, and database analysts.  We cannot continue to rely on outside firms to help with these key technologies.* A prevailing notion seems to be that project execution is owned by IT.  The business should drive project execution."</a>

Most often the problems are solved in a reasonable time but it is difficult to understand many individuals answering the calls or the ones calling you back.  I have to ask them to repeat theirselves many times and even then I'm not sure what they are asking or saying.</a>

move IT help out of India. They are very hard to talk to and usually do no more than enter a ticket into the system. Local IT (Fort Wayne) is hit and miss on help. One time they are right on top of a problem and the next time they are hard to do business with even on the same issue. Local IT boss seems more interested in knowing if I had a ticket number rather than what my problem was!</a>

My IT Business Partner is easy to do business because we both work on relationship building and close org alignment. Other IT Business Partners look at Parts as afterthought which does not help integrate across enterprise. More business involvement with IT Leadership meetings would help.</a>

We were told by the local IT person that was dispatched that they aren't supposed to do anything other than take information and do minimal tasks like resetting passwords.Given all the multitude of systems the various departments use, there is no way for a Help Desk person who doesn't even work for us to understand our problem. We need local business unit IT people that can be quickly deployed and are familiar with a particular business group.

"The person responsible for our Oracle/Stellant issues is not always cooperative.  He is impatient and instead of helping to resolve problems he creates more.The language barrier for our outsourced help is frustrating.  It also slows down the process of getting issues resolved.  Often times they mark issues as resolved because they don't understand.  When screen shots and explanations of problems are sent and they have to pass on the problem to another support person they do not forward the entire e-mail so the new support person has to ask all the questions and get all the screen shots again.

That wasn't any better. Just this morning I was having difficulty just logging on.  I shut down my computer 3 times, lost almost an hour of productivity, but would NOT call the helpdesk.  It is a big inconvenience dealing them.  9 times out 0f 10 you need someone here anyway.  So I call India or wherever, then I can't effectively communicate with them because of the language barrier, so they call someone here to help me.  Where does that make any sense? Others feel the same way, believe me.  I really hope they all express their feelings here like I am because it is a completely ineffective, non-value added way of doing business.  We may be saving dollars by using an alternative to a U.S based company on paper. If going to another country saves money, you need to make sure there is not this language barrier. It's totally frustrating! I think Navistar really needs to re-evaluate this process or the company we are using because in my opinion someone needs to ask the question of how much productivity is being lost because of how bad this situation is.  I haven't heard one single positive experience with our helpdesk."</a>

I gave A as in Apple, B as in Basket, C as in Cat and they still could not get it.  I asked the person if they could let me know if there was an issue with the external website and I could not get an answer until they got my user-id right.

"Last week, I requested that an intern obtain access to three things: a shared drive, access to our website, and ability to scan documents on a printer on our floor.  He was given access to the shared drive in a prompt manner and I received confirmation.  However, regarding the website, I received confirmation that he was set up properly, but he was not set up because he couldn't log in--he eventually received access, but it was an extra couple days later.  In addition, no confirmation email was sent letting us know he was properly set up after the follow-up request.  The only reason we knew he was set up properly is because he successfully tried to log in.  As for him being able to scan on the local printer, it appears as though someone tried setting him up, but it was not set up properly.  Apparently someone is still working on this, and it has been a week later.  In addition to this employee, I requested that a National Account Manager receive access to our website on 5/9/2011 but I never received confirmation from anyone and once again it wasn't until the user was able to log in that we found out he did have access.

Problems get resolved - usually.  But it is a painful and difficult process.  The help desk needs to be local.  They know our systems and fix issues quickly.  Adding a layer into the solving process DOES NOT WORK WELL.  Our help desk has NEVER been better than when it was located in our location!  The locals know the business!</a>

"The Help Desk personnel act more as secretaries, but do not take proper notes when creating a ticket. They ask a lot of questions and do not put down the responses on the ticket. I find that I have to repeat the same responses at least two or three times for every ticket if it is not a simple issue, and then repeat it yet again when the on-site IT person contacts me. This is even more so an issue when using the IT Chat function. The IT Help person on the chat should copy the conversation and attach it to the ticket to prevent the conversation from being wasted time.This would be a more functional business practice for IT.Also, I have noticed an increasing communication barrier when calling the Help Desk, but it is not on my end. I can understand them even with heavy accents, but most do not seem to be able to do the same or do not understand a lot of the IT issues and concepts. This adds three to five minutes to any conversation when the person does not readily understand and has I have to repeat the issue several times before it seems to click. I am not sure if this is a language barrier issue or a call center lack of industry knowledge, but it takes time away from my projects. "</a>

Once the IT department has received the ticket (can be hours or days) the ticket is worked on and usually taken care of in a timely manner.  Why would Navistar put a block in place of going directly to the IT department you know will fix the issue?  It's time consuming and very frustrating on my part.

This is still not as efficient as it was in the past before the IT Service Desk was implemented.  It takes longer to get issues resolved and we no longer know the person(s) who need to be contacted to get an issue addressed immediately (and the service desk occassionally doesn't know either).</a>

"Almost all issues are solved by local IT people, yet we still have to call the hotline.  The hotline people rarely understand the issue and are little more than receptionists for the local IT group.  I will say that the local IT group are adept for the most part, but seem understaffed as response time is lacking.Another major issue I have is the poor access to software tools.  Other companies I have worked for have a website where employees can search a list of available software then simply click on the tool they need and the software will automatically install.  If the software is restricted, the website will automatically bring up an approval form which will be emailed to the appropriate parties for approval.  Once approval is given, simply go back to the website and download the software.  This system is so simple and efficient, and no human IT employee has to touch a computer for software install (other than troubleshooting).  When I first started here, I had to wait two weeks for two items of software that are necessary for my job.  And I'm not near the only individual that has had this issue."</a>

In particular I am amazed that I have never been given any instruction or training relating to data security and backups which considering how much company confidential and proprietary data is available on individual's laptops is a major weakness. I did order a local back up drive when I originally ordered my laptop but to date (6 months later) there has been no sign of it or follow up.</a>

As a result of the staff turn over in the past year or so there are now fewer people than before in IT that understand Navistar's business.  New staff members with IT seem to have varying levels of interest in gaining an understanding of Navistar's business.</a>

"As I noted, calling the service desk for issues creates an inconvenience.  Many IT team members would rather email back and forth several times then come to the desk or call and work it out. I understand that some issues may be solved easily by logging on remotely, but some would be quicker to just be more willing to come to the desk.  That being said, I had a major issue with Adobe, and Ed Durham, in particular, was EXTREMELY helpful.  He has checked up on me for issues every once in a while ever since.  It helps having someone I know I can go to. He is a great person for your team! Also, there seems to be a bit of a gap if people do resolve an open issue, and when it gets closed.  Sometimes it gets done, and I get contacted later with someone thinking its open, and sometimes it gets closed before it is resolved.  I am guessing it would help internally with checking efficiency if this was monitored more closely. I think Lisle would be an easier move if the IT team makes sure to be open to temporarily move away from the 'ticket' way of solving issues.  People are already cranky about the move, so the fewer things to give them to complain about, the better. "</a>

"From what has been stated from those in IT about ACHIEVE, there is strong cause for concern.  The individuals in IT are very concerned about their jobs go forward.  The group seems demoralized by all of the changes that have occured over the past two years which all have been perceived as negative to the group and it's customers (re-badging, Planview, IT Help Desk) and ACHIEVE introduces yet another change.Furthermore, from what I understand on the ACHIEVE model (support organization vs. project-based), it will create a ""have"" and ""have not"" environment.  The support area suffers because it does not learn new skills and work on interesting projects and is paid less, and deals with disgruntled customers; the project-based area gets all the focus and more pay and happier customers.  If the support group is to be outsourced, no one internally is happy with the service levels from outsourced organizations becuase they are not in contact with us or share accountability for our goals.  Outsourcing almost always never works because it takes 2x-3x longer for them to accomplish the work.  I have personally seen this model implemented in two companies, with the results being not good, and the one causing another complete restructure 5 years later.IT seems to be moving towards a ticket-based, metrics-based environment and true ignoring customer service, which seems to being only be futhered by ACHIEVE.  This is a bit contrary to the relationship-based values of Navistar.  True customer service will not show up in ticket counts.  We also need to employ individuals locally within our company rather than rely on outside firms to help us.  We know our business best--not consulting firms, and certainly not outsource providers.  Our interactions with these firms has been very costly with very mixed results and have proven to be very costly."</a>

Getting to them via India has been a less than desireable experience.In terms of IT providing hardware, I find we are using adequately good material. It's not the best or fastest, but it works.In terms of IT providing basic software (OS, Office, Hypersnap, UG, etc...) It works, however its 2011 and we are still using office 2007.  In terms of IT providing specific, non-enterprise level software/database solutions, IT has fallen flat.  There seems to be no mechanism (or desire) to help small groups with their needs.  I can provide specific examples, should the need arise to contact me.In general, IT may be doing an excellent job at a very high level.  We can take a truck order, convert it to POs to suppliers, route parts across the globe, build vehicles, back flush material, invoice dealers, etc...  but we can't provide a decent project management tool to track quality issues, or we cannot provide a system that ties all Workflow business applications (pixys, PCBL, APCN, Release, WA, etc..) together automatically.

"I am worried that the model of sending IT support off-shore frightens me.  It is extremely valuable having someone on site that we can build a relationship with, that knows our systems, and can suggest improvements.I'd also like IT to push for one source of all people data.  There are way too many people data systems that don't talk to each other.  For example, Data Security has their own system and the Melrose system doesn't talk to the WHQ system, so a Melrose employee has to be given a visitor badge when at WHQ (I would think an employee is an employee).  I think it would be better if all people (employees, contractors, consultants, POI, etc.) should be in PeopleSoft and that system should feed every other system."</a>

When something is not done correctly we have to keep putting tickets in to have someone come over and resolve our issues. Also,it is very clear that the plant has priority over our location.

I find it ironic that when you dial 6666 and it asked you to select 1 for english and the person you get on the phone to help you can only speak broken english at it best. The group in Inday (I guess) is only helpful about 50% of the time the other they have to kick it to someone else (local team).  That brings on another issue.  Ever since the local team was made IBM employees that have had a worse attitude than when they were Navistar employees (and it was not great then).  All they try and do now is shuck responsibility.  Every time you go to them now you hear a 30 minute speach on how they are not Navistar employees blah blah blah.  The corporate IT made this change and did not even look at what each plants IT team did.  Then they changed the on site employee to IBM and now they can't do all of what they were doing before.  Who is suppose to take over thier responsibilities now.  Everyone in this plant has plenty of responsibility right now and you have an outside vendor (IBM) trying to give you more work.  I am not pleased with this.</a>

I have had a few instances of dealing with IT. Some of the simple things such as setting up my printer or password changes etc... have been dealt with wonderfully. But I had a very important instance where the program I work in for my department had a failure and it took IT a very long time to correct it. In fact others in my department helped me fix the problem because IT was taking so long to get back with me. They seemed very unorganized and I believe the main reason for this was the possible overseas or seperate locations of the people I was dealing with. It seemed like no one wanted to take the initiative to help fix the problem which in tern was a very simple solution for them to do. I work in the warranty department and process claims.Tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars pass through my terminal weekely and I was down for about 4 days. Also because I am required to have my name signature on everything I do through my login it was impossible for me to work on someone elses computer. My managers also tried as hard as they could to speed up the process but were also met with resistance. I thought this was an important topic to be made aware of because of the time and money lost do to the IT personel I was dealing with. I believe it would have been fixed within hours if I had simply been put on a priority list to be handled ASAP. I hope this may help in your survey and future choices. Thank you</a>

"I have only one comment in our IT direction:The decision to move Uptime Parts QAD environment to be hosted externally at a QADvendor location was very confusing and frustrating. The technical and business case that was presented did not seem to be the best solution. I provided alterative solutions that would leverage existing infrastructure and consolidate Workhorse & Uptime Parts QAD environments. However, my proposal was not reviewed thoroughly by any of the teams to evaluate if this proposal was any cost saving for Navistar. From the responses I received, it appeared that the decision to outsource had been made before the proposals were put together. Outsourcing the QAD application was quoted as 1 Million dollars, which is a biginvestment in an environment that is not strategic (long term). Even more concerning is that we would not own the QAD/Infrastructure with this deal, and I believe that when the time comesto finally migrate QAD to a replacement platform, we will again need to pay to the external vendors. The proposal I have provided would have saved infrastructure cost for both the business units and the QAD maintenance & licensing cost by half. This was very disappointing that no one was able to see this cost justification. OR at least, no one explained to me in a logical way why my proposal did not make the most sense."</a>

"If you have only worked at Navistar, you do not have a concept as to how bad things really are here. Navistar is at least 10 years behind with PD processes that fully leverage PLM tools. IT and PLM infrastructure is painfully slow and does not seem to be what the vendor (Siemens) recommends or supports. FORD and GM have way more simultanious users of Teamcenter, they utilize it's capabilities much better and it works great. NOT HERE. Very frustrating. And, Sea Change does not have a clue how to achieve this either. IT support can be a major Black Hole. NO enforced service-level-agreement on response. Unacceptable at other compaines. Be careful when the ""competition"" figures out how to do basic IT/PLM. "</a>

There is and has been a need to change IT, no question about that.  In the immediate quest to save money (and at the end of the day its all about the money), part of the soul of IT has been lost.  We can produce as many charts or graphs as we like or move folks around or shift to outside vendors, however the most important thing that can't be done is to get someone who works for another company to care."</a>

My disappointment is with the level of service and inability for them to correctly log tickets, to resolve the issue themselves, or for them to actually forward in a timely manner the ticket to someone who can contact me back in less than 24 hours. Each time there has been a survey like this I have provided specific examples of situations that I have encountered with the 800# IT group. The problems are not being resolved with them and the level of service has not improved at all. Others have told me they don't fill out these surveys because they feel the issues won't be addressed and they don't want to spend the extra time to report their specific experiences."</a>

"Navistar has chosen to conduct much of its business through electronic communication. However, its IT department is a very poor support service. It's service is not timely, very hard to access, confused and wholly inadequeate. If Navistar intends to do business electronically, it needs to provide its employees much better technical support than it is providing today. An employee with an IT problem can wait days for assistence, and when it comes, most likely, the IT person does not understand the issue or solve the problem. We need an IT change immediately."</a>

"Since IBM took over our IT services, there are many days we are completely unable to perform our work due to network and system issues.  There are many ongoing problems within Teamcenter that have no solution.  These problems cause us to have to restart our computers sometimes several times a day.  I view the current IT service as a hindrance to our productivity.  We had none of these problems when all of our IT functions were performed in house by direct Navistar employees."</a>

The Help Desk is often an ordeal. The customre service people are in India and have a list of 20 canned questions that you must go thru just to open a ticket. They arenot capable of trouble shooting or resolving the issues but you still have to spend 10-15 minutes with them so they can write a profile.  Can we streamline the process?

If I know there is a problem specific to my location and I know who to contact to help, I try to explain that to the operator and they say they are going to try to help.  Turns out they can't and I have wasted even more valuable time.  Or they will argue with me when I tell them exactly who the ticket needs to go to.  I finally end up getting a ticket number and calling the person who knows our location's systems anyway."</a>

"Two issues with IT:  Lack of understanding (person not understanding what I'm saying and me not understanding what the person is saying) when I'm patched through to India for help.  Having to say ""pardon me"" over and over and over is somewhat embarrassing and time consuming and also the person not understanding my explanation of the problem is a real hindrance to solving my issue.  Also, timing of receiving help is another problem.  For example, someone in my group sent a job order to our network printer one morning and for some reason it wouldn't print and he was unable to delete the print job from his print queue.  Becase of this, the printer wasn't printing anything anyone in my group sent to the printer. I sent an e-mail to the service desk late morning (instead of calling and wasting time trying to explain to someone in India) and of course was informed that it would take 4 hours or more to have someone get back to me to resolve the issue.  Well, our group went without a printer the whole day and by the next day the problem resolved itself on its own before we ever got a response back from the service desk.  Wished there was someone in IT we could call in the building who could just help us out quickly with a problem like this but understand that times have changed and people are not available for this type of help anymore.

"When calling the IT Help desk i can get rather impatient. If there are issues with a system, I have to hear the announcement/problem before I can proceed to the options. Often, it appears that the technicians/engineers on the other end sound like they are talking rather slowly and verifying information before I can proceed to the concern I have. I haven't timed it, but waiting for the opportunity to voice your issue can take near a minute. A minute surely doesn't sound like a long time, but if you imagine sitting in silence for that time before you can speak. I simply am noticing these steps before I have a chance to share the reason for the call."</a>

"When IT is mentioned, I believe this to be Navistar employed personnel and not accenture support desk.  Our whole world is spinning because of the whole ticket system.  For example.  I have to create a Svc Req which can only be a 3 or 4 priority.  Then it may get cancelled and get replaced by an incident or eventually a change request.  the process is long and drawn out and keeping track of them is not easy.  no one provides any feedback unless you hound them and even that does not help becuase we are understaffed.  too many cheifs and not enough indians.  it takes an act of God to get anything done.  communicating with people in a differnt country adds another whole dimension - sometimes like being in the twilight zone.  If we speak english, then we should have people who are working on our issues who have good control over the english language.  some of my issues have taken an extrodinarily long timne to complete because of the language barrier.  I do not see any regression testing going on when changes are put in and sometimes it appears that things that have been fixed revert back to being broken after subsequent fixes are imiplemented.  Also, there does not seem to be a real sense of urgency.  "</a>

"When we call for help language barriers are sometimes an issue. When a problem is called in that first group hands it off to another group while they pat themselves on the back and send you a survey asking how you liked their service.  I did not like it because my problem was still not resolved.  Example, I had a bad printer.  Called it in to 1300. They said they would pass it onto the local team.  Local team comes looks at it and says printer broken we are passing onto outside printer repair people. Printer repair say printer is broken not repairable.  At this point I have talked to 3 groups each who has told me the printer is broken.  I start getting surveys about the service.  Well, I am not really happy with the service because I still could not print after dealing with 3 different groups.  By the time it was all said and done I was at least a month without a printer.  A couple days I could see but not a month.  This is probably the worst case example I have so far but I would just add that very rarely do I have a positive experience when I call for IT help. I think IT is supposed to be a service organization but I really give the IT help process and results very low grades.  I think it was better when you were dealing with someone locally from start to finish.  There was a relationship between IT and the customer and the IT person had ownership of the issue.  Now it is a pass the buck as fast as you can process."</a>
