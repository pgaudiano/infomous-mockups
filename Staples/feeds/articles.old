<p>You can call any fledging project a startup, but transforming a concept into a successful business requires ongoing maintenance, education, and resource management. Add the challenge of growing a small business online community and entrepreneurs that aren't in touch with technological advances can be easily overwhelmed. General Assemb.ly, a rising global startup and technology hub, works to bridge the gap between envisioning a business and solidifying it through improved training, design and marketing.</p>

<p>
<strong>Enhancing Your Business from a Digital Perspective</strong></p>

<p>As you work to develop a 
<a href="http://appcenter.staples.com/home#!category/171">small business online community</a>, you will no doubt be bombarded by conflicting ideas about how to generate Internet buzz for your business. You'll hear about social media, blogging, keyword optimization, mobile app development and Web analytics. General Assemb.ly offers short classes and full-length courses on how to choose the techniques that make the most sense for your business and master the digital experience of your customers. Step by step, the company shows you how weaving digital advancements into your back-end infrastructure will positively affect the end user and attract a sustainable audience for your business.</p>

<p>At its roots, General Assemb.ly is a workspace co-op where some of the country's most anticipated startups rent office space and individual creators can pay for monthly access to workrooms, media labs, libraries and other essential tools. If you live close to a US General Assemb.ly campuslocations include Boston, New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisconetworking and workshop events can connect you to influential corporations, pioneering developers and partnership opportunities with other small businesses. The nature of marketing has become more social, so companies often thrive by merging their interests and engaging consumers in multiple experiences at once.</p>

<p>Build a community of forward-thinking minds by joining General Assemb.ly as a hiring partner. The program streamlines the recruitment process at your new business by putting you in touch with candidates who have extensive training in tech development and commerce fields. Fostering the right people will help you develop more effective social media campaigns and marketing content, conserving your resources in the long run.</p>

<p>
<strong>Educating Business Owners about Technology Concepts</strong></p>

<p>General Assemb.lys instructors are innovative leaders in industries like Web design, startup consulting, recruitment, digital product development and consumer marketing, among many others. Avoid diving into classes without a plan; look for the opportunities that match up with your goals and weaknesses.</p>

<p>If the designs for your websites, online campaigns or apps were completely outsourced, learn to communicate better with your development team through 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Web-Design-Programming/cat_CL167779">General Assemb.lys</a> introductory classes like Programming for Non-Programmers or User Experience Design. For sales-driven businesses, professional instruction on Google Analytics, ecommerce marketing and Social Product Design are beneficial for evaluating your business's online success at conversion and meeting consumer demand.</p>

<p>Short lectures or multi-session courses are often available online as a live stream or video recording, allowing you to participate from any location. Few prerequisites are required for online courses because the instructors realize many business owners need to start with the basics.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Expanding Your Online Community</strong></p>

<p>The extent of your investment depends on your business skill set, areas that need improvement and budget. General Assemb.ly occasionally offers free courses and many online sessions are as low as $20. If you intend to participate in a ten- or sixteen-week intensive workshop, prices typically range from $3,000 to $12,000. Business owners located near an official campus may benefit from becoming a hiring partner, as this program includes access to exclusive recruitment events and grants a 10 percent discount on any courses. You can also find helpful free resources from the General Assemb.ly blog, which covers similar topics to the paying courses.</p>

<p>The biggest potential pitfall is failing to tailor your efforts to your specific business needs. Mastering popular software boosts your skill set, but it won't help you build a community if it doesn't enhance your business structure in some way.</p>

<p>Ultimately, General Assemb.lys provides the tools to rethink the visual representation of your business online, find groundbreaking ways to communicate with consumers, create profitable partnerships, and distinguish your business with smart branding. By understanding how technology drives trends in commerce and marketing, you can make sure your business stays ahead of the curve and continually builds a loyal following through social outreach.</p>

<title>Finding the Right Supply Chain Model for Your Company</title>
<description>Managing your supply chain is an important part of ensuring that you meet the needs of your customers.</description>

<p>Your supply chain is made up of all the people and companies that play a role in serving your customers. If you want to create a supply chain model to help you better serve your customers and achieve business growth, you have several options. Learning about the different supply chain models will help you determine which model will have the most positive impact on your business.</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits of Finding the Right Supply Chain Model</strong></p>

<p>Managing your supply chain is an important part of ensuring that you meet the needs of your customers. Demand planning helps you reduce errors when forecasting customer demand, which could help you avoid ordering too much inventory. Procurement planning can help you identify potential supply chain issues with your vendors, while manufacturing planning will help you determine if your manufacturer might have issues filling your orders.</p>

<p>Because transportation issues have a significant impact on the delivery of goods, performing transportation planning activities can help you avoid late deliveries and other transportation problems. Finally, master planning provides an overview of the four areas of supply chain performance. Master planning activities can help you anticipate problems in the areas of demand, procurement, manufacturing and transportation. Anticipating these issues will help you avoid lost sales and improve the level of service you provide to your customers.</p>

<p>
<strong>Innovations in Supply Chain Management</strong></p>

<p>In the past, business owners had to do a lot of guesswork when it came to anticipating problems with product manufacturing and delivery. The ability to use a computer to create a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/PCs-Laptops-Tablets/cat_CG71">supply chain model</a> eliminates this guesswork, making it possible for business owners to make decisions based on objective data. The Process Classification Framework (PCF) created by the American Productivity &amp;amp; Quality Center is useful for business owners in any industry. This high-level supply chain model allows you to identify processes that need improvement and organize your improvement efforts. The Supply-Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model monitors supply chain performance. This model helps business owners identify potential issues with all parts of the supply chain. The model takes production flexibility, delivery, inventory and other factors into account, giving you insight into how well your supply chain is performing. Whether you use the PCF Model or the SCOR model, creating your own supply chain model can help you streamline business processes, increase efficiency and identify successful supply chain strategies for your company.</p>

<p>
<strong>Supply Chain Models and Their Costs</strong></p>

<p>There are some possible pitfalls involved in using a supply chain model. One is that rising costs are changing the way supply chains operate. Your supply chain model could give you dozens of pieces of information about controlling these costs. You must be able to focus on just a few ideas at a time so that your attention is not divided among too many metrics. Another potential pitfall is that you must reassess your supply chain model regularly due to economic changes and changes in the way you source and deliver products. If you rely on the same supply chain model for too long, you could miss out on critical information. Finding 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Employee-Management/cat_CL164585 ">supply chain issues</a> in your organization costs nothing more than your time. If you hire a supply chain consulting firm, expect to pay a consultant several hundred dollars per hour to review the performance of your supply chain and create a supply chain model that will help you improve your processes.</p>

<p>Supply chain modeling can help you identify weaknesses and areas of opportunity in your organization, making you better able to meet your obligations as a business owner. Investing in educational tools or registering for workshops about supply chain management may help you learn more about creating a supply chain model and using it to improve your business.</p>

<title>Three Subtle Ways Management Style Affects the Boss-Employee Relationship</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>If you have even one employee, you understand some of the challenges associated with managing people effectively. What you may not know is that your management style may be subtly influencing the way each employee perceives you. As a result, the ways in which you manage people affect the boss-employee relationship. Learning how your style affects this relationship will help you be a more effective business leader.</p>

<p>
<strong>Management Styles and Their Benefits</strong></p>

<p>There are five distinct management styles: democratic, paternalistic, autocratic, laissez-faire, and servant leadership. Those who use the democratic style encourage employee input when making decisions. Paternalistic managers try to consider the best interests of employees as well as the company when making decisions, but they still retain control over all decisions at all levels. Autocratic managers, also known as authoritarian managers, request little input from employees and give them little autonomy. Laissez-faire managers allow their employees to make big decisions, give very little guidance, and maintain a hands-off approach. Servant leaders are self-effacing managers who focus on the needs of their employees.</p>

<p>Your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Employee-Management/cat_CL164585">management style</a> may fit into one of these categories, or you may display behaviors from a blend of two or more styles. No matter which of them applies to you, the way you lead your employees subtly influences your relationships with them.</p>

<p>
<strong>Employee Perception</strong></p>

<p>The first way your management style influences your relationships is by affecting the way employees perceive you. If you use an autocratic management style, your employees may think that you do not value their knowledge and expertise. If you use a laissez-fair management style, your employees may think that you do not take your business seriously, as this style can leave employees feeling as though they have little guidance when making major decisions. Understanding which management style you use will benefit you by enabling you to communicate with workers in the most appropriate way and resolve conflicts in a productive manner.</p>

<p>
<strong>Innovations Through Feedback</strong></p>

<p>Another way your management style affects the boss-employee relationship is by influencing the technology tools and business products you use. The democratic style is one of the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Dry-Erase-Boards-Markers-Cleaners/cat_DP2078">management types</a> that may work well with the use of whiteboards and bulletin boards, as these tools can help you solicit feedback from employees. Using these tools can therefore help you build more collaborative relationships with workers. If employees feel that they have the freedom to try new things, they may also be more innovative in their approaches to solving problems.</p>

<p>
<strong>Pitfalls of Not Recognizing Your Management Style</strong></p>

<p>Your management style also affects how you communicate with employees, so you may unknowingly be damaging your relationships with workers simply because your communication style is not compatible with theirs. If you are an autocratic leader, for example, you may use the word "I" frequently, which could influence employees into thinking that you do not share the credit for company successes with your workforce. If you previously managed employees for a large corporation, the formal management style may not work well with employees in a small business. You must be able to recognize which of the management types describes your style so that you can use that information to communicate more effectively.</p>

<p>Whether you are new at managing people or have been doing it for years, your management style has a significant impact on how employees perceive you. Once you understand your management style, it is possible to adjust your behavior so that you can use it to your advantage instead of letting it affect your relationships with employees in a negative way. It may be helpful to invest in some management training programs or books about management style to help you make any necessary changes. Adapting your management style to better suit your employees, either on your own or through training, will better your boss-employee relationships and strengthen your company.</p>

Before you create your own mobile website, you should consider the features that the best mobile websites have in common so that you can build a site that will wow anyone.</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits of Having a Mobile Website</strong></p>

<p>Mobile websites have numerous benefits for the website user. What puts the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Tablets/cat_CL204449">best mobile websites</a> on top is the fact that the users enjoy browsing them from their mobile devices. For the business owner, this can result in more sales. Some of the benefits to using a mobile site include:</p>

<p> Improved user experience</p>

<p> Faster download speed</p>

<p> Easier access for engaging and socializing with others</p>

<p>All of these user benefits have a direct effect on your business. In addition, businesses that have a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Web-Design-Programming/cat_CL167779">mobile site design</a> often find it easier to get customers to identify with their company brand. If your company uses a mobile website, it may also give you an advantage over your competition because your site will be easy to browse from a wide range of devices.</p>

<p>
<strong>How the Best Mobile Websites Use Technology</strong></p>

<p>
<strong></strong>The best mobile websites have simple, yet appealing designs. Plus they are all optimized for performance so that users can find what they are looking for quickly and define their brand on the mobile site.</p>

<p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p>

<p> Keep it simple</p>

<p> Consider function before form</p>

<p> Define your brand in your mobile interface</p>

<p> Optimize your mobile site design for performance</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Building a Mobile Website</strong></p>

<p>The cost of your mobile website design will depend on the company that you use to design the site. Designing professional mobile websites can cost anywhere from $700 to $1,600. However, you need to keep in mind that a well-designed mobile website can increase your profits, and over time, it may pay for itself. The best mobile websites have been professionally designed because those business owners wanted to ensure a great customer experience. If you want your business to compete with the top mobile sites out there, then you need to have a site with a professional look and appealing design to make your company stand out from the rest.</p>

<p>If you look into a crowd of people, you'll probably see at least one person browsing the Internet from a smartphone or tablet. With the Internet at everyone's fingertips, it's important that your business has a mobile website that's easy to navigate. The best mobile websites are all simple to use, which can result in higher profits for your company.</p>

<title>Can Your Business Efficiently Run a Free CRM System?</title>
<description>A free CRM system may help you build customer relationships without increasing your operating costs.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Customer relationship management refers to a system of developing stronger relationships with customers by learning about their behaviors and needs. CRM systems help you accomplish this task by organizing all of your customer data so that you can easily access it. The information found in a customer software package can help you close more deals and make more money, so CRM systems should play a major role in your business operations. If you operate a small business, a free CRM system may help you build customer relationships without increasing your operating costs.</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits of a Free CRM</strong></p>

<p>CRM systems have several benefits for businesses of all sizes. Members of the sales force can enter customer data directly into the system, making it easily accessible to anyone who needs to know a customer's product preferences or contact information. Having this type of information in a central database reduces the amount of time it takes to find important data, making salespeople and sales managers more productive. Using Web-based CRM systems reduces the need to keep customer data in paper files, which helps eliminate searching through stacks of paper to find information. A CRM system also allows you to save information about customers personal preferences, which can lead to more sales.</p>

<p>
<strong>CRM Technology &amp;amp; Innovations</strong></p>

<p>Before committing to a purchase, you must decide if a free CRM system will support your company's customer relationship management activities. When shopping for 
<a href=" http://www.staples.com/PCs-Laptops-Tablets/cat_CG71">CRM systems</a>, you must ensure that your employees' computers meet the minimum system requirements. You must also determine whether a free application is scalable in case your company grows. Some small businesses will be able to use free applications to manage CRM data, but others will need to invest in paid applications that can accommodate rapid expansion. In the past, salespeople had to keep stacks of customer cards at their desks or in their cars. Every time they wanted to find a piece of information, they had to sort through the cards until they found the right one. CRM systems make it possible to find customer data with just a few keystrokes, making workers more efficient and productive.</p>

<p>
<strong>Pitfalls of a Free CRM</strong></p>

<p>Free applications cost nothing, but the potential pitfalls may outweigh the low price. It may cost you more to maintain a free 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Office-Productivity/cat_CL167739">customer software</a> package than it would to purchase a commercial CRM system from a company that provides continuous support. Free application developers may not provide software updates very often, making it difficult to continue using a free CRM system when you need new features or better functionality. If you decide to purchase a system, you may spend as little as $100 or as much as several thousand dollars per user. If you use Web-based CRM systems, you should expect to spend at least $30 to $50 each month.</p>

<p>A customer relationship management system can help you take control of your customer data and use it to your advantage when making sales calls or closing deals. Before implementing a system, examine your company's needs and determine if you require a paid system or if you can make do with a free application. Investing in a CRM system can improve the productivity of people in your sales department, adding extra dollars to your company's bottom line.</p>

<title>Obamacare Simplified: The Essentials of Health Insurance Reform in 2013</title>
<description>Failing to understand the provisions of this law could affect your bottom line.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010. This health insurance reform will have a significant impact on small business owners, as it contains several provisions regarding employee health coverage. If you need to follow the law, this Obamacare simplified guide will help you learn more about how it will affect your company. Failing to understand the provisions of this law could affect your bottom line and leave you vulnerable to legal action.</p>

<p>
<strong>Health Insurance Reform Benefits</strong></p>

<p>Legal compliance is an important aspect of running any business, as running afoul of this law can get your company in trouble with the federal government. Under Obamacare, any business that has at least 50 full-time employees must provide health coverage for employees who work 30 or more hours each week. Simplified, this means that you will have to pay a penalty if you have at least 50 employees and do not provide the required health coverage. The penalty amounts to $2,000 per employee after the first 30 workers. For example, if you have 50 employees but dont offer healthcare, your penalty would be $40,000  20 employees multiplied by $2,000.</p>

<p>Analysts expect that some companies would actually prefer to pay the penalty rather than provide the required health coverage to their employees. Other analysts expect that employers will reduce the number of full-time positions in their companies, so that they have fewer than 50 full-time employees. That way they would not be required to provide employee health coverage.</p>

<p>
<strong>Technology Drives Health Care Reform Savings</strong></p>

<p>The Affordable Care Act will also affect how you use technology in your human resources department. If you are reviewing information about 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Financial-Accounting-Tax/cat_CL167738">Obamacare</a> here are a few things to help you understand the tax issues associated with this law.</p>

<p>Employers who provide health insurance for fewer than 25 employees may qualify for a tax credit to help offset the costs. In 2013, this tax credit is 35 percent of the cost of the insurance for businesses. In 2014, the credit will increase to 50 percent. This is one of the positive effects that 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Scanners/cat_CL158948">Obama healthcare reform</a> will have on small businesses. Because you need to be able to provide proof of coverage for your employees, it is important to document the type of coverage and the amount of money paid for each employee's insurance premium. If your insurance company sends paper bills instead of electronic ones, use a scanner to save these statements to your hard drive. This will make it easy to access when you file your taxes.</p>

<p>
<strong>Pitfalls of Obamacare</strong></p>

<p>The cost of meeting the mandates outlined in this law will depend on the health plan you select. Some employers will choose catastrophic health insurance plans to meet the rules of Obamacare. This means that employees will have to pay high deductibles in exchange for lower insurance premiums. The National Federation of Independent Businesses estimates that the average health premium for small businesses is $4,260 per year for individual policies and $11,100 per year for family policies. If your company has 50 employees, meeting the provisions of this act may cost you anywhere between $213,000 and $555,000 per year, depending on the number of individual and family policies you purchase.</p>

<p>The complex language of the law makes it difficult to understand the provisions of Obamacare. Simplified rules will help you understand what you must do to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. This Obama healthcare reform may cost your business a significant amount of money, but it may also help you qualify for additional tax credits. Consider investing in an updated tax guide to gain a deeper understanding of Obamacare, simplified tax rules and other topics that affect your business.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>It's important to understand all of the advantages of an LLC before making the decision to register your business as a limited liability corporation. While an LLC offers numerous advantages, you should be aware of some LLC requirements. Once you have all of the information, you can make an informed decision and do what's best for you and your business.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Benefits of an LLC</strong></p>

<p>People choose to register their businesses as limited liability corporations for many reasons. Whether you want to save money on your taxes or reduce your liability, you'll find there are numerous 
<a href="https://appcenter.staples.com/home#!category/168">advantages of an LLC</a>. An LLC:</p>

<p> Reduces your personal liability</p>

<p> Offers LLC tax benefits</p>

<p> Makes it easier to build business credit</p>

<p> Makes it easier to raise money via the sale of stock</p>

<p> Adds credibility to your business</p>

<p> Prevents disputes between partners</p>

<p>The advantages of an LLC appeal to many small-business owners because it keeps personal and business finances separate, reducing personal liability. For example, if you register your business as a limited liability corporation and someone sues your business, you aren't at risk of losing your home or other personal belongings. There are also a few 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Financial-Accounting-Tax/cat_CL167738">LLC tax benefits</a> that make limited liability corporations appealing, and a limited liability corporation offers a pass-through tax treatment so you avoid double taxation.</p>

<p>
<strong>Technology to Help Limited Liability Corporations </strong></p>

<p>When you register your business as a limited liability corporation, you'll quickly discover the many advantages of an LLC, including the tax benefits. While this type of benefit is a good thing, it's important that you keep flawless records of your business transactions. Fortunately, numerous accounting and tax software programs can help you keep accurate records. In addition to accounting and tax software, you might find that business inventory and business management software is helpful for your day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Forming an LLC</strong></p>

<p>While there are many advantages of an LLC, you'll also find that forming a corporation involves specific costs. When you register your business as a limited liability corporation, you'll have to file the required forms with your state. These forms are part of the LLC requirements, and there is a fee associated with filing the forms, which varies from state to state. One of the advantages of an LLC is that the corporation is its own entity, so the owner or owners will also have to put money into the business. The amount of money that you choose to put into your business originally is entirely up to you. You should take into consideration any equipment and advertising costs your business will incur in the beginning and decide how much money each partner will pay up front. All the costs are documented in the business paperwork, so there is a legal record of each owner's financial responsibility.</p>

<strong>The Benefits of New Software and Accessories </strong></p>

<p>When you're looking for the best business software and new tech accessories for your business, a few things need to be considered. You need to make sure that the software or accessories that you purchase will benefit your company. For example, many people wait for a new Apple accessories launch, but not all of the tech savvy gadgets will impact your bottom line. Some things, however, could have a huge impact on your business. Some of the benefits of using the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Computer-Software/cat_CG5">best business software</a> include:</p>

<p> Making it easier to collaborate with others on a project</p>

<p> Giving you the ability to access and edit your documents from multiple locations</p>

<p> Providing more storage space by storing your important business documents using cloud facilities</p>

<p> Helping you to get work done from your mobile phone or tablet</p>

<p>
<strong>How New Technology Impacts Businesses </strong></p>

<p>New technology, such as cloud programs, impact on how business owners operate the day-to-day operations of their businesses. Some people consider cloud programs to be the best business software because they let you complete all of the same functions that productivity programs allow you to complete, but cloud software allows you to work remotely. Cloud computing also allows multiple users to access and edit documents, making it easier to collaborate on projects. Technology also impacts the type of equipment used in business operations. Company owners can use new gadgets to work remotely. Some people also wait for an 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Mac-Mice-Keyboards/cat_CL167191">Apple accessories launch</a> to update the equipment in their offices so that their employees have top-of-the-line equipment available to them. Gadgets like wireless keyboards and wireless mice let you create a streamlined workstation that's functional and appealing.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Changing Your Business Programs</strong></p>

<p>The cost of updating your business software and accessories depends on what you're actually upgrading. If you are trying to keep your costs down, search for software and accessories that will be cost effective and increase overall productivity. For example, some programs can cost you hundreds of dollars, but if the software effectively increases productivity, it will more than pay for itself in the long run.</p>

<p>Upgrading your equipment and software can have a huge impact on the way your business operates, which can increase your profits. Whether you want to upgrade your office equipment or purchase the best business software out there, it's important to know how the items you purchase will benefit your company.</p>

<p>As a business owner, learning how to improve customer service should be one of your top priorities. Your customer service department is the face of your company, and the employees that are handling your customers' concerns are representing your company with every task they complete. You want to satisfy your customers so that they continue to do business with you and refer your company to their friends. Because customer opinion is so important, learning how to improve customer service and set customer service goals is crucial.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Benefits of Good Customer Service </strong></p>

<p>Customer service is all about building relationships with your customers. Consumers enjoy doing business with companies that offer quality customer experiences, so you should always be looking for ways to improve customer service. Your customers want to feel like their concerns are taken seriously and their problems are resolved immediately. In order to provide a great service to your customers, it's important that you learn how to improve customer service quality and set customer service goals for your employees. Building a solid relationship with your customers through your customer service department has numerous benefits, including:</p>

<p> Giving your company a good reputation</p>

<p> Encouraging customers to return to your company for future business</p>

<p> Prompting customers to refer their family and friends to your company</p>

<p>Every business owner strives to build a successful business, but without a steady stream of customers, success wouldn't be possible. Think of your customer service department as the front line of your company and take the time to learn how to improve it. You should consider numerous factors when you're 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Computer-VOIP-Headsets/cat_CL140478">improving customer service</a>, including:</p>

<p> Being available to take your customers' phone calls or answer emails</p>

<p> Educating your customers on your products and services</p>

<p> Understanding the problems your customers are facing and knowing how to resolve them</p>

<p> Communicating with your employees so that they know about any changes in procedures</p>

<p>
<strong>Using Technology to Improve Customer Service </strong></p>

<p>If you're taking the time to learn 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Email-Chat-Communications/cat_CL167737">how to improve customer service</a>, then you should also take the time to assess the type of software your company is using in its customer service department. To ensure your employees provide quality customer service to your customers, you need to provide a reliable way for your staff members to communicate. While corporate email is effective, you should also consider upgrading your software to include an employee chat program. This gives your customer service representatives a way to ask other employees job-related questions and get a quick response while they are on the phone with a customer. You should also make sure that all of your production and quality-control software is up to date so that your managers can properly monitor your representatives.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Improving Customer Service</strong></p>

<p>Learning how to improve customer service is an ongoing process, so there's no exact cost for you to consider. However, when you are revamping your customer service process, you need to think about the costs of new software, new equipment, and training your employees.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Small-business apps make it easy for small-business owners to manage and run their businesses from their smartphones or tablets. Whether you're looking for an application to help you stay productive while youre on the go or to help you back up data, it's easy to find one that suits your needs. Once youve started using some of the top business applications, youll wonder how you managed without them in the past.</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits of Small-Business Apps</strong></p>

<p>You will find numerous benefits to using 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Tablets/cat_CL204449">small-business apps</a> to manage your business. Not only do applications allow you to access your company's data remotely, but they also help you to keep working when you aren't at the office. Some of the top small-business apps allow you to:</p>

<p> Create, edit, and view documents</p>

<p> Back up important information</p>

<p> View PDF files</p>

<p> Chat with employees</p>

<p> Monitor your business operations</p>

<p> Track and analyze data</p>

<p>
<strong>Types of Technology Available </strong></p>

<p>Whether youre interested in backing up data or working remotely, plenty of small-business apps are available. It's important to consider what you need to accomplish when you choose which apps you want to use for your business. Some of the top small-business apps include:</p>

<p> Google Drive</p>

<p> Microsoft SkyDrive</p>

<p> Adobe PDF File Viewer</p>

<p> OfficeTime</p>

<p> Polaris Office</p>

<p>Google Drive and Microsoft SkyDrive are ideal choices for business owners who are 
<a href="https://appcenter.staples.com/apps/3952?1708913328">backing up data</a> and important documents. Internet-based storage applications give you ample room to store files, and you can access them from any location.</p>

<p>The Adobe PDF File Viewer allows you to view important documents from your smartphone or tablet. Whether you need to read lengthy files or review a presentation before its sent to your clients, the Adobe PDF File Viewer makes it easy.</p>

<p>If you need to stay productive while youre away from the office, Polaris Office is a good small-business application to use. The app allows you to create, edit and view documents, spreadsheets and presentations.</p>

<p>OfficeTime is a simple but very practical program that allows you to track your business expenses, keep a record of billable hours and generate invoices for work you've completed. This way, youre always on top of your business finances.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Using Small-Business Apps</strong></p>

<p>The cost of using small-business apps depends on the type of application you choose to use. For example, if you want Google Drive to back up data, you can use the app for free. However, applications like OfficeTime and Polaris Office can cost anywhere from $15 to $70. The more advanced the application is, the more it will cost you, but you need to keep in mind that this is typically a once-only fee, and the amount of time small-business apps can save employees could end up saving you a lot of money in the long run.</p>

<p>Staying productive when you arent at your office and backing up your companys data doesn't have to be difficult. Small-business apps can help you accomplish a variety of tasks and keep you on top of anything related to your business. Small-business apps make running your business simple, and once you begin to use the apps, you won't know how to function without them.</p>

<title>Make It Easy: Creating a Terms of Use Template</title>
<description>Many websites rely on a terms of use template to cover agreements with visitors and purchasing customers.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Many websites rely on a terms of use template to cover agreements with visitors and purchasing customers. Creating one can help your small business prepare for launching or redesigning its website. You can apply a template to almost any website; although you must make sure that the provisions apply equally and are bound in solid legal constructions.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Benefits of Terms of Use Templates</strong></p>

<p>A 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/MyAttorney-Home-Business/product_666179">terms of use template</a> can help ensure that your websites covered in the event of a lawsuit. A solid terms of use agreement should have long-reaching legal protections that come into play if your company faces allegations, like failing to provide goods or services. These protections may save your company from loss of income, forfeiture of assets or goods, and in extreme cases, dissolution or bankruptcy.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Latest Developments in Website Law </strong></p>

<p>Clear and concise 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Quicken-Legal-Business-Pro-2013-for-Windows-1-User-Boxed/product_108858">terms of use</a> can go a long way toward creating protection for your business. The terms of use agreement should take into account the many changes that constantly affect laws based on Internet operations. The latest developments in these laws involve the use of browse-wrap and click-through agreements. Browse-wrap terms of use assume that anyone visiting the site has access to the terms and agrees to them. However, this type of implicit agreement is falling out of favor with the courts. Click-through agreements require users to take some sort of action that confirms they have both read and agreed to the terms of the site.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost and Potential Pitfalls of Terms of Use </strong></p>

<p>Terms of use can be inexpensive to create, but the cost of faulty or illegal terms can be exceptionally high. Common pitfalls include terms that force the user to agree to conditions beyond the scope of the site, or terms that require the user to submit personal information without consent. Many terms have provisions that mention that any clause rendered invalid does not render the entire agreement invalid. Without such provisions, it may be possible for the slightest legal inaccuracy to render the full set of terms of use null and void. This would eliminate any benefits gained from creating the terms of use in the first place. This is especially important when you use a template to copy your terms across multiple sites that may have different purposes.</p>

<p>Terms of use can protect your small business against litigation in a number of circumstances. Understanding how these terms affect your company, Internet visitors, and paying customers is the first step toward gaining such protections. The precautions you must take to avoid the many pitfalls that can render terms of use invalid can be difficult, but they can be invaluable when used properly.</p>

<title>Incorporation Evaluation: C Corporation Advantages &amp; Disadvantages</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>When you start a business, you have to decide whether you will operate as a sole proprietor or form a corporation. C corporation advantages include lower audit risk, limited liability for business debts, and the ability to raise capital by selling shares of company stock. You also have the option of forming an S corporation, which has different advantages and disadvantages than a C corporation. Understanding C corporation advantages and disadvantages will help you determine if this business structure is right for you.</p>

<p>
<strong>Advantages of a C Corporation</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest C corporation advantages is that the owner has limited liability for the debts of the business. If a sole proprietor orders $10,000 of merchandise from a vendor and fails to earn enough money to pay for the order, the sole proprietor is personally liable for the $10,000 debt. This means he must use his own money to pay the vendor. If the business owner does not have enough funds to do so, the vendor may file a lawsuit, putting the owner's home and personal property in jeopardy. C corporation owners, on the other hand, have limited personal liability. This means they do not have to give up their personal property to satisfy business debts, even if a business fails. An S corporation also offers limited liability, which is why some business owners choose to form corporations rather than operate as sole proprietorships.</p>

<p>Business owners should also be aware of C corporation tax advantages. A business owner may be able to use her C corporation status to reduce the amount of income tax she pays each year. If she earned $100,000 as a sole proprietor, that entire amount would be subject to personal income tax and self-employment tax. If she earned $100,000 as the owner of a C corporation, however, she could choose to take a $40,000 salary and leave $60,000 in the corporation. In that case, the business owner would only pay personal income tax on the $40,000 salary and corporate tax on the remaining $60,000. Another 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Accounting-Forms/cat_CG1283">C corporation tax</a> advantage is the ability to lease assets to your own company. If you do this, you will qualify for tax deductions that can reduce your total tax obligation.</p>

<p>
<strong>Apply for C Corporation Status Online </strong></p>

<p>After you review all of the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/PCs-Laptops-Tablets/cat_CG71">C corporation advantages</a> and disadvantages, it is important to talk to an attorney or tax adviser before proceeding. You must choose a business structure based on your own circumstances, so what is right for another business owner may not be right for you. What someone else considers a C corporation advantage may actually be a disadvantage for your business. If your advisor recommends forming a C corporation, you can take advantage of online filing. All you need is a computer with an Internet connection to complete the process.</p>

<p>
<strong>C Corporation Pitfalls </strong></p>

<p>Although there are a number of C corporation advantages for business owners, there are also some potential pitfalls. If you own a C corporation, you cannot pass losses on to your company's shareholders. You are also subject to double taxation if you distribute dividends to your shareholders. This means that you pay tax on the business profits and then your shareholders pay income tax on the dividends. Your attorney will be able to tell you if these drawbacks outweigh C corporation advantages. The price to form a C corporation varies from state to state, with fees ranging from a low of $45 in Arkansas to a high of $440 in Connecticut. If you use an online filing service, you should also expect to pay at least $99 for that service.</p>

<p>Choosing a business structure is one of the most important decisions you will make because your choice affects your legal status and your tax situation. Review C corporation advantages and disadvantages then talk with your attorney to determine if this structure is right for your business. If you need more information, invest in books about business planning and taxation.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>When you own a business that regularly ships products to customers, logistics is one of the most important aspects of your company. If any part of your company's logistics isn't operating correctly, it could cost you a lot of money.</p>

<p>SCM software plays a huge role in the logistics process. Its designed to streamline your shipping and receiving processes and is extremely helpful in strengthening your company's entire logistics operation.</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits of SCM Software </strong></p>

<p>SMC 
<a href="https://appcenter.staples.com/home#!category/171">What is SCM software</a>, or supply chain management, software has a wide range of benefits. The software is a combination of computer programs designed to help you track every aspect of your shipping and receiving operations and identify any problem areas. The supply chain optimization portion of the software can offer you solutions. SCM software tracks:</p>

<p> Purchase order processing</p>

<p> Your company's inventory</p>

<p> Customer requirements</p>

<p> Your company's suppliers</p>

<p> Your warehouse management operations</p>

<p>In addition to tracking your entire day-to-day operations processes, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Shipping-Boxes/cat_DP1428">SCM software</a> can analyze your customer's orders to provide a supply and demand forecast, which helps determine the items you should keep in stock.</p>

<p>
<strong>How Technology Effects Logistics</strong></p>

<p>Analyzing a company's logistics requires a lot of data. SCM software was designed to help business owners analyze the data needed to find problem areas in their companies. This technology also plays an important role in analyzing trends in customer orders, company performance and your business' inventory.</p>

<p>
<strong>Cost of SCM Software </strong></p>

<p>Numerous logistics and supply chain companies have SCM software that you can purchase. Because SCM software is a combination of computer programs, it gives you the option to choose portions that will benefit your company the most. Most companies that sell SCM software also offer software packages that are specific to different industries. This makes it easier for you to find and hire employees who are already familiar with specific software. The cost of the program, installation and training varies depending on the company and options you choose. Because the software is designed for particular companies and industries, price quotes tend to be detailed and specific. In order to determine the best price, it's important that you contact multiple logistics and supply chain companies to obtain a quote.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a way to streamline your company's shipping and receiving processes, track and analyze data, and track your company's inventory, SCM software is a good choice. While it may cost you a lot initially to install the software and train your employees to use it, the programs can save your company money year after year.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The Small Business Administration (SBA) works to strengthen the rights of small business owners and represents small business owners within government agencies. If you are interested in getting an SBA loan or grant, you must review the guidelines carefully and submit all of the information required. Learning how to get SBA financing will help your small business grow.</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits of Small Business Administration Loans or Grants</strong></p>

<p>SBA loans have several advantages over a traditional bank loan, including longer repayment periods and lower down payment requirements. This allows you to keep more cash on hand for expenses. The SBA also provides up to 90 percent financing on some loans. Depending on the SBA loan program you choose, you may be able to take out a loan of up to $11.25 million.</p>

<p>If you want to get a SBA loan, you must complete all of the required steps in the process. Before filling out an application, determine whether you want to apply for the microloan program, the 7(a) loan program, or the CDC/504 loan program. The microloan program is for small businesses that need short-term loans in small amounts. The 7(a) loan program provides loans for businesses that meet special requirements. You may be able to qualify for this type of SBA loan if you have been affected by the North American Free Trade Agreement or if your business meets other criteria. The CDC/504 program is intended to promote business growth while financing small businesses. The funds from a CDC/504 loan may be used for business expansion or upgrades.</p>

<p>
<strong>Preparing a Business Plan </strong></p>

<p>Once you have identified the loan program that meets your needs, you must prepare a business plan. Your plan should include:</p>

<p> Executive summary</p>

<p> Business profile</p>

<p> Documentation of management experience</p>

<p> (Brief) statement of anticipated loan repayment terms</p>

<p> Personal and business financial statements</p>

<p> Description of your proposed business</p>

<p> Financial projections</p>

<p>You should use spreadsheet programs to complete the financial statements that are required for your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Office-Productivity/cat_CL167739">SBA</a> application. All of this information should be prepared on a computer, printed with high-quality ink, and placed in a binder or presentation folder to make it easier to read. If youre wary of doing it yourself, there are consultants available for hire to help you produce a business plan, as obtaining 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/View-Binders/cat_CL167205">SBA financing</a> depends on your ability to persuade the organization to give you a loan.</p>

<p>
<strong>Pitfalls of Small Business Administration Loans or Grants </strong></p>

<p>Getting this financing requires a significant investment of your time, but it also requires a financial investment. You may be required to pay an application fee to cover the cost of the credit check, so the lender can determine if you qualify for the loan. There could also be an underwriting fee, closing costs, maintenance fees, or packaging fees. Your lender will explain these fees and tell you how much it will cost you to apply for and accept an SBA loan. In the meantime, ensure you complete the loan application properly and submit an application packet that contains all of the required information. Making any errors during the application process will increase the amount of time it takes for a lender to review your application and approve your application for a SBA loan.</p>

<p>Although SBA grants are not available to finance a new business or pay for business expansion, the Small Business Administration makes several types of loans available to business owners. You must review the requirements carefully and submit a complete application package to improve your chances of being approved for a SBA loan.</p>

<title>Google This: 5 Company Culture Examples Worth Emulating</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Your company culture reflects the beliefs, values, and behaviors of everyone in your workforce. As a result, company culture has a significant effect on the success of a business. If you are just starting out, it is important to cultivate a positive culture right from the beginning because it is difficult to change behaviors and attitudes that have become the norm. If you need some inspiration when determining your desired company culture, it can be helpful to review company culture examples of successful businesses so that you can emulate the ones that make the most sense for yours.</p>

<p>
<strong>Having the Right Company Culture Really Matters </strong></p>

<p>Examining the cultures of other companies can help you create a list of desired attitudes and behaviors that you will seek in the people you hire. When you avoid hiring the wrong people, you can improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover. Google is one of the companies you might consider emulating, especially if your business is involved in the technology field. The company has an informal product development process and gives staff members access to the co-founders and chief executive.</p>

<p>If your company relies on customer service professionals to keep customers happy, examine the company culture of Wegmans Food Markets, which is consistently voted one of the best places to work in the United States. Instead of focusing on rapid expansion, Wegmans opens just a few new stores each year. This allows the company to send its best employees to the new locations to get the stores set up properly. Wegmans spends millions of dollars training employees and will not open a new store until all staff members are fully trained and ready to work.</p>

<p>
<strong>Innovations in Company Culture </strong></p>

<p>If creativity is one of the most important traits you look for when hiring employees, the company culture of DreamWorks Animation may be worth reviewing. DreamWorks executives strive to foster creativity by encouraging employees to take risks and giving staff members the opportunity to engage in spontaneous discussions. This type of company culture seems to be paying off for DreamWorks because the company has an astonishing 97 percent employee retention rate. Salesforce.com also has a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Sales-Forms/cat_CL100200">company culture</a> worth imitating if you work in the competitive technology field. Led by Marc Benioff, Salesforce.com delivers cloud computing solutions for businesses around the world. Staff members collaborate by sharing ideas via a social networking application called Chatter. This application allows employees to analyze data, compare drafts of documents, and share ideas in real time. Real-time data sharing eliminates the lag associated with the use of email and other older methods of communication.</p>

<p>
<strong>Not Every Company Culture Can Be Emulated</strong></p>

<p>When considering pricing in determining your company culture, you may want to take a look at 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Apple/cat_CG1377">Apple corporate culture</a>. Apple is known for its innovative products and sleek designs. The company is also known for offering tech products at higher price points than its competitors, but consumers still line up to buy new products or purchase upgraded versions of existing products. Apple corporate culture is built on innovation, but critics report that the executives push their employees hard and expect nothing less than the best from them. The company's focus on creating seamless consumer technology has allowed it to prosper even when other tech companies have experienced declines in sales. One of the major pitfalls of basing your culture on successful company culture examples is that culture is not a one-size-fits-all concept. You can gather valuable information by researching the corporate culture of other companies, but you must be sure to pick the values and behaviors that will work best for your particular business.</p>

<p>If you want to create a company culture that helps your business thrive, you must work toward that culture from the startup phase of your business. Doing things right from the beginning will save you from having to correct undesirable behaviors or ask employees to change their attitudes at a later date. Investing in books and other educational tools about management and company culture can also help you create a culture that makes you proud.</p>

<a href="http://www.staples.com/Notebooks-Pads-Filler-Paper/cat_CG1234">leadership summit</a>, like pens, paper, or an agenda.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a less expensive option, try researching various leadership summits and decide what type of conference will benefit your employees the most. Leadership summits are held throughout the year, and there are many available that cover a wide range of topics. If you choose to send your company's leaders to a leadership summit, be prepared to pay for their entrance to the summit, which typically costs a few hundred dollars per person, flights, food and accommodations.</p>

<p>Leadership conferences are great continuing education opportunity for your employees. Whether you decide to organize your own summit or send your employees to one, you'll be happy you made the decision when they return to work filled with motivation and armed with new knowledge.</p>

<title>Six Dimensions: Understanding Social Media Literacy for Business Leaders</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Social media tools make it easy for small business owners to interact with their current customers while attracting new clients, too. As a result, understanding social media is essential for small businesses that rely on Facebook and Twitter to get the word out about their company.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Benefits of Social Media</strong></p>

<p>Social media has several business-boosting benefits. First, it helps level the playing field between small businesses and the large organizations that use powerful marketing and public relations strategies. Social media make it possible for any business owner with a computer to let people know about new products and services, upcoming events and other information that might appeal to potential customers. Understanding social media also makes it possible for small business owners to generate excitement about their companies. Small businesses typically can't afford full-page magazine ads or 30-second TV spots. However, social media makes it possible for them to get their message out to thousands of people at very little cost. Ultimately, this type of marketing can help drive Web site traffic, locate potential customers and create a consistent brand image across several platforms.</p>

<p>As a business owner, you should be familiar with the six dimensions of social media marketing literacy:</p>

<p>1) At the personal level, you should be able to understand what makes social media messages go viral.</p>

<p>2) As a social media producer, you should develop an authentic voice and be able to create compelling content.</p>

<p>3) As a recipient of social media messages, you should be able to filter through messages to find the ones that are most important.</p>

<p>4) At the organizational level, you should be able to coordinate social media activities and support an interactive social media environment.</p>

<p>5) As an advisor, you should understand the cultural impact of social media and leverage its power for marketing and other business functions.</p>

<p>6) At an analytical level, you should be able to monitor and respond to social trends as they are happening.</p>

<p>
<strong>Technology &amp;amp; Innovations to Help You Understand Social Media</strong></p>

<p>Those interested in 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Mobile-Phones/cat_DP5128">understanding social media</a> realize that anyone with a computer or mobile phone can connect with customers and spread the word about a company's products and services. In the past, business owners had to spend a lot of time and money buying advertising, working with public relations consultants and making pitches to reporters. With social media, however, small business owners can reach their target audience directly and eliminate those costs. Improving your understanding of social media can help you drive sales, increase customer satisfaction and streamline your marketing efforts.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Keeping Up </strong></p>

<p>Along with giving you direct access to your customers, another benefit of social media is that its extremely cost effective. In fact, many social media tools are free. You may have to buy some social media apps for your laptop, tablet or mobile device, but the cost is minimal  only a few dollars for each application. The low cost of these apps makes increasing your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/All-Laptop-Computers/cat_CL167289">social media literacy</a> an easy way to reduce your marketing expenses. There are a few social media pitfalls your business should avoid. One major mistake is using social media to argue with customers who have complained about your products or services. Another is posting too many messages that aren't relevant to people in your target market. Be careful to post targeted messages that will appeal to the people you want to have as customers.</p>

<p>Social media is an important part of your marketing strategy, as it helps you reach a broad audience without significantly increasing your costs. Make sure you invest in the right tools and educational products that will help you understand how to use social media properly.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Companies look for the best customer service representatives they can find. So your customer service resume objective needs to immediately notify employers of your desire to make their customers happy. A great resume objective is exceptionally important for many reasons.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Benefits of a Solid Objective</strong></p>

<p>A 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Any-Time-Organizer-Deluxe-Version-14-Boxed-CD/product_369334">customer service resume objective</a> is often overlooked by applicants, but an outstanding objective provides many benefits. It helps potential employers understand your expected goals within the company. And helps elevate you above the rest by showing the interviewer that you have goals that are in line with the company's expectation for the position. Including a powerful objective also demonstrates your goal-setting abilities and attentiveness to planning.</p>

<p>
<strong>Staying Ahead of the Pack </strong></p>

<p>The 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Organizer-Pro-8-for-Windows-1-User-Download/product_954879">best customer service</a> objectives show an interviewer that you have what it takes. Customer service is all about interfacing with customers, and showing that you understand how potential customers think can help land you the position. Your resume objective must demonstrate your ability to connect with customers on a written level and point out how your goals can align with those of the company.</p>

<p>
<strong>Using Software Can Help and Hinder</strong></p>

<p>Resume software, which usually costs between $15 and $20, can help you organize your thoughts and experience, but can often fail to capture your enthusiasm for the position. So when writing your objective, remember to maintain a high level of energy and convey understanding of the needs of a company's customers.</p>

<title>Optimize Away: Top SEO Tools &amp; Tricks to Dominate Google</title>
<description>Is your website using the right SEO tools?</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Website owners have been using SEO tools for years as a way to position their websites at the top of search engine results, bring in more traffic, and attract new customers. With each Google update, new SEO tools and tricks are devised by clever website owners to keep their sites ranking at the top of the search engine results pages (SERPs). Here are a few top SEO tricks you can use to dominate Google:</p>

<p>
<strong>Choose Killer Keywords</strong></p>

<p>A keyword is a term or phrase that a person types into a search box on Google (or another search engine, such as Bing or Yahoo) to find a relevant website. You want to have these keywords integrated into your website so it will pop up in the SERPs when someone searches for those terms. However, these keywords must be relevant to your website, article, product, or service.</p>

<p> There are popular phrases that people search for, as well as other phrases that are never typed into Google. The key is to do some research to find out what keywords are searched for often that don't appear on many other websites already. The Google Keyword Tool is one of the most popular SEO tools you can use to help you find high-quality keywords.</p>

<p>
<strong>Optimize Images with Keywords </strong></p>

<p>Just as keywords are important for the content you place on your blog, you should also have keywords attached to all the images on your website to dominate Google. This 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Easy-Website-Pro-5-Unlimited-for-Windows-1-User-Download/product_955268">SEO tool</a> is often overlooked, yet it can make a big impact on your SERP standings.</p>

<p> Many people search Google for pictures instead of words, so you always want to have relevant keywords attached to your images. The ideal situation is to have the same keyword you are targeting on the headline also placed on your image's ALT text, title, and description spaces. When you have a great image, people will use it and credit the source, providing free traffic to your site.</p>

<p>
<strong>Write Content for Humans </strong></p>

<p>Before Google's latest updates, website owners wrote a lot of content on their site simply to gain higher ranking in the SERPs. They stuffed articles with keywords, but the articles themselves provided little value to a person reading it. This has also changedGoogle now penalizes sites that pack in keywords with high-quality contentso it is now more important than ever to write high-quality content that your actual human visitors want to read.</p>

<p> You still want to incorporate keywords, but they should appear naturally throughout the article. It can be a delicate balance to provide quality content for humans and enough keywords to be picked up by the search engines.</p>

<p>
<strong>Diversify Your Links </strong></p>

<p>There are several ways to build links that can be used to grow traffic for your website, and you should incorporate all of them. When you think about SEO tools, the act of link building probably comes to mind. Experts often say that the best 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/WebSite-X5-Evolution-8-for-Windows-1-User-Download/product_954870">SEO trick</a> is internal linking: linking one page of your website to another. This shows Google that everything you put on your website is relevant to everything else, so it must be a quality site.</p>

<p> It is important that the words you link to are synonyms, such as: SEO tricks, SEO tips, SEO tricks of the trade, SEO tools, and SEO tools of the trade. Using slightly different words assures Google that it's not spam and that the content is relevant.</p>

<p>
<strong>To Wrap it Up </strong></p>

<p>When you put in the time and effort to find high-quality keywords, add keywords to the images on your site, provide informative and interesting content for your readers, and build links, your time is well spent. Using these SEO tools and tricks will help you increase traffic to your site, which in turn will increase your sales and profits. ?</p>

<title>Enough Already: Five Key Causes of Stress in the Workplace </title>
<description>There are strategies that can help with easing stress at work.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Many people have a love/hate relationship with their jobs. Some love the work they do but aren't fond of the environment in which they do it. Others like their coworkers, but they do not find their duties challenging or enjoyable. Still others feel totally overwhelmed with demands and responsibilities. There are strategies that can help with easing stress at work, but first, it's important to identify where these stresses often arise from.</p>

<p>
<strong>Key Cause #1: Demanding Boss</strong></p>

<p>Everyone has probably had a boss who insisted in perfection in all things. The smallest mistake is met with criticism or the threat of disciplinary action. On the other hand, perhaps your boss wasn't quite that dictatorial; it was just that he or she did not understand why a sick child necessitated you taking a day off or doing some important work at home. An overly demanding boss does not only cause stress in the workplace, but can also make an employee feel devalued. The quickest way to ruin office morale is to make your employees feel like failures.</p>

<p>
<strong>Key Cause #2: Conflicts with Coworkers </strong></p>

<p>In some offices, everyone gets along; in other others, however, this is not the case. A work environment is made up of a variety of people, and when you put different types of people in the same environment, personality conflicts that can be a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Vitamins/cat_CG1443">cause of stress</a> are bound to occur. It also does not help that, with the current economic climate, some people can feel frayed at the edges and possibly prone to shorter tempers than they might have under more optimal circumstances.</p>

<p>
<strong>Key Cause #3: Workload</strong></p>

<p>When a company downsizes, the work that terminated employees did does not simply go away. Those left behind are typically required to pick up the slack. This could mean that one employee is doing the work that two or more did previously. This leads to later hours, working lunches and weekends, less sleep, and more 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Mrs-Fields-Everyday-Gifts/cat_CL165240">stress in the workplace</a>. Managers often expect the office to run just as effectively with five people as it did with tenespecially because they have quota of their own to meet, and their own job security concernswhich just compounds the issue. An increased workload with no increase in pay or benefits can be one of the greatest causes of stress an employee can face.</p>

<p>
<strong>Key Cause #4: Fear of Losing Your Job </strong></p>

<p>After watching a series of coworkers get pink slips, you might well be on pins and needles, wondering when you will receive yours. You are overworked and might have already taken a pay cut, but management insists that your work must remain at a high-quality level. This is one of those causes of stress that keeps even the most even-keeled people up at night.</p>

<p>
<strong>Key Cause #5: Lack of Communication</strong></p>

<p>When you work for a company that is typically transparent, but that transparency suddenly disappears, this can lead to understandable speculation about what is going on. A lack of communication becomes a cause of stress, breeds office paranoia, and provides grist for the rumor mill. Before you know it, the whole company is packing up and moving overseas, and a twenty-person office staff is fighting over ten career postings on a job site.</p>

<p>
<strong>What You Can Do about Stress</strong></p>

<p>To alleviate some of the causes of stress in the workplace, deal with the issues you can control:</p>

<ul>

<li>If you have a conflict with a coworker, try to find a diplomatic way to work it out. Often conflicts result from simple misunderstandings.</li>

<li>If your boss is too demanding, find a respectful way to communicate your concerns.</li>

<li>If you have too much work, try to delegate some of it to another coworker if possible.</li>

<li>Ignore rumors, and don't feed the rumor mill yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although you cannot completely remove stress from your work environment, you can control how you let it affect you. If you strive to lessen the stresses you can control, you will be better equipped to make peace with the issues you cannot. Understanding the causes of stress lets you identify them before they become problems.?</p>

<title>Office Fitness: How to Stay Fit in the Wide World of Business</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>People that work in an office often have a hard time staying in shape because the majority of their time is spent sitting at a desk. However, it's easy to incorporate office fitness into your daily routine while you're at work. With just a few changes and some easy exercises, you can stay fit, even while working in an office. Here are a few ways to inject office fitness into your lifestyle.</p>

<p>
<strong>Get Up and Move</strong></p>

<p>Because movement is the key to burning calories and staying fit, you should get up from your desk and move around. A simple five-minute brisk walk every half-hour is ideal. This is just enough time to get your blood pumping and move your muscles without interrupting your work. It can be as simple as getting up and walking quickly to the printer or copier, or taking a stroll down to the mailroom. This way, you're keeping active while still being productive.</p>

<p> Another way to introduce 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Nintendo-RVLRRFPE-Fit-Plus-Bundle-Fitness-Wii/product_104340">office fitness</a> into your daily routine and stay in shape is to take the stairs instead of the elevator. Going up and down stairs is a great way to fit some aerobic activity into your day at work. Make it fun by gathering a few coworkers for a race to the top or the bottom of the stairs. (Obviously, don't run: Safety is always the first priority.) Taking the stairs will not only keep your metabolic rate up and burn some calories, but it will also relieve stress, energize you, and help you stay in shape.</p>

<p>
<strong>Simple Chair Exercises</strong></p>

<p> For more formal ways to incorporate office fitness into your daily routine, grab an exercise band or some hand weights and do chair exercises. There are countless chair exercises you can do to stay in shape while sitting at your desk, some of which could involve wrapping the exercise band around your chair and using it to do arm exercises.</p>

<p>
<strong>Lunchtime Workout </strong></p>

<p> The best way to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Microsoft-4XS-00001-Nike-Kinect-Training-Fitness-Xbox-360/product_104322">stay fit</a> with office fitness routines is to get a workout in during your lunch break. If you don't have a gym in your office building or close by, just grab some water bottles and walk around the parking lot. Use the water bottles for hand weights and walk briskly around the edge of the lot, making sure to keep an eye out for cars.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Importance of Office Fitness </strong></p>

<p>When you take some time to incorporate office fitness into your daily routine, you will feel happier as the exercise reduces your stress and improves your mood. Regular exercise also decreases your risk of heart disease, boosts good cholesterol, and decreases bad cholesterol. Exercising regularly can also help you maintain a healthy weight, reduce your risk of stroke, and even alleviate depression. </p>

<p> Getting up and away from your desk several times a day to move around and partake in office fitness is easy to do if you put your mind to it. Do some chair exercises, take the stairs, or spend your lunch break at the gym, and you will be a healthier and happier person. ?</p>

<title>Empowered in 2013 and Beyond: Helpful Assistance Programs for Women in Business </title>
<description>These assistance programs are tailored for women who want to start their small businesses.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>We've all heard the saying, "It's a man's world." Well into twentieth-century America, the great majority of business owners and chief breadwinners were men. When women worked, many of those jobs tended to be in what was then considered traditionally feminine roles as teaching, nursing, or cosmetology. For the most part, women were employees, not employers. According to SBA Administrator Karen Mills, 30 percent of all businesses now are owned by women, and the revenue from those companies tops $1.2 trillion annually. From childcare to technology, women are blazing a trail in business ownership. This increase in female-led enterprises has spawned a sector of lending and 
<a href="http://www.sba.gov/">assistance programs</a> that cater specifically to women in business.</p>

<p>
<strong>Types of Programs Available for Women </strong></p>

<p>Women have always had entrepreneurial spirit, but financing for women in business still can be hard to attain at times. The following assistance programs are specifically tailored for women who want to start or build their small businesses.</p>

<ul>

<li>8 (a) Business Development  The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers a nine-year program to help women succeed in business. In a mentor/mentee-type setting, the program is broken down into two parts: Years one through four make up the development stage. Mentors help new business owners navigate through the start-up and growth of a new business. Years five through nine make up the transition stage, where mentors help a business that has made it through the first tough years continue to thrive. Having access to an experience business owner who has already been through the process is invaluable. </li>

<li>Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Concern (SDVOBC)  Also formed by the SBA, this program helps disabled veteran business owners procure contracts in both the public and private sectors. If you are a woman and you were disabled while serving in the military, the 
<a href="http://www.sba.gov/content/women%E2%80%99s-business-centers">programs for women </a>offered could be of great benefit.</li>

<li>WOSB Federal Contract Program  The Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Program allows contracting officers for federally funded projects to set aside a certain number of contracts for women-owned businesses. To be eligible for this program, a business must first be classified as a WOSB. To qualify, the business must be at least 51 percent women-owned, be owned by a U.S. citizen, and be classified as a small business by the SBA.</li>

<p>Sometimes it's difficult for business owners to tell which employees would be good in business leadership roles. Not every employee has what it takes to be a leader. It's important that business owners learn to recognize which employees have potential quickly, so they don't waste time and money trying to turn average employees into team leaders. Fortunately, if you know what to look for during the hiring process, creating leaders isn't as hard as you might think.</p>

<p>
<strong>How to Hire Someone with Leadership Skills</strong></p>

<p> The success of your business depends on how well your employees work together and how productive they are on a daily basis. Most employers want to hire people who can get the job done without a lot of help or supervision and still work well as a team. To determine whether you're hiring someone who would fit a business leadership role, you need to interview the person multiple times to get an accurate account of past work performance. Keep in mind that people who will do well in a business leadership role should be able to make tough decisions without any help and be willing to do whatever it takes to make their team a success. When you're 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/be-the-boss-managing-your-business-your-employees-and-your-time.html">creating leaders</a>, you have to look at both the person's personality and skills.</p>

<p>
<strong>Turning Good Employees into Great Leaders </strong></p>

<p> Creating leaders involves giving your employees easy access to the supplies and training they need to excel in a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/for+dummies/directory_for+dummies?fids=145472|144839&amp;amp;rpp=24&amp;amp;pn=1&amp;amp;sr=true">business leadership</a> role. Someone in such a role needs to know how to monitor a team's productivity, how to use all the business software and equipment designed for the job, how to effectively work with people on the team, and how to make important decisions without hesitating. This means that the training you give your potential leaders should include thorough overviews of the jobs the team will be performing, as well as management and communication training.</p>

<p>
<strong>Costs of Training Employees to Become Leaders </strong></p>

<p> The cost of training people to fill business leadership roles varies depending on the type of business you own. To determine an accurate cost for your company, you should consider the cost of the actual training, the cost of the training supplies, and the cost of paying the person who is training for the business leadership role.</p>

<p>Once you've streamlined your hiring process and learned to spot potential leaders, you'll find that the cost of training people to become team leaders will decrease. The bottom line is to take your time hiring employees, and if someone isn't working out, let the person know quickly. This way, you aren't wasting time or money. ?</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>As small businesses move into virtual and dual retail models, keeping up with product status and movement can be difficult. Common do-it-yourself inventory-management tools like spreadsheets can require numerous labor hours to keep up with constant changes. Manual data entry also leads to inevitable accuracy problems with inventory reports. Instant access to inventory data can keep back order and shipping issues from occurring, increasing customer satisfaction and revenue for your business.</p>

<p> 
<strong>Balancing Virtual Sales with Physical Inventory</strong></p>

<p> Small businesses are reaching out to an expanding customer base through the Internet, but many retain one or more physical locations. As inventories, supply chains, and order fulfillments become increasingly complex, merging traditional 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/inventory/directory_inventory">inventory management tools</a> with automated data entry can help reduce errors that result in costly overstock, back orders, refunds, and customer service issues. Using bar code readers to keep track of products and inventory decreases the chance of manual entry errors and increases productivity throughout the process. Keeping a single master inventory database that is updated in real time allows all systems and employees to provide accurate information drand point-of-sale service.</p>

<p>
<strong>Working in the Cloud </strong></p>

<p> Common solutions to online inventory issues include the use of cloud-based or cloud-compatible 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/QuickBooks-Premier-2013-for-Windows-1-User-Boxed/product_957738">business logistics</a> tools. Instead of calling from one store to another, employees can look up inventory online, arrange for a product transfer, or drop-ship to a customer location. E-commerce solutions can be linked to the same database, allowing virtual systems and physical employees to work in cooperation. Additional benefits of cloud-based inventory management tools include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Secure collection and dissemination of data </li>

<li>Flexible access limitations that allow owners to control what functionality each employee can use</li>

<li>Redundant backup options in case local data is destroyed</li>

<li>A convenient link between product databases and shipping functions</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Cost of Online Logistic Solutions</strong></p>

<p> Business logistics solutions might sound expensive, but small business owners who are willing to spend some time in creative planning can find affordable tools. Coupling inventory management tools with accounting software that you already use is cost effective and a smart use of resources. Even if you add accounting software such as QuickBooks, which can cost between $200 and $400, or subscribe to an online inventory service, which starts around $20 per month, you can realize significant savings through better product management. Inventory management tools can reduce costs by: </p>

<ul>

<li>Providing trending reports that allow business owners to make better pricing and purchasing decisions</li>

<li>Helping owners spot inventory bottlenecks and release cash tied up in overstocked items</li>

<li>Reducing costs associated with inventory staff hours</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Inventory Tools Are a Good Business Investment </strong></p>

<p>Return on investment is a key consideration for business owners who are considering any type of process change or upgrade. For a small business that might be starting out or experiencing cash flow problems, immediate return is necessary for almost any expense.</p>

<p> When used properly, inventory management tools can provide a return by reducing overhead, increasing profits, and decreasing error rates, making them a good investment for any small business. With such useful inventory management tools to work with, you'll find them a great investment for your business. ?</p>

<title>Native Advertising: What It Is &amp; Why It Impacts Business Growth </title>
<description>Native Advertising: learn how you can reach more customers.</description>

<media:thumbnail url="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/images/res/22_native_advertising.jpg"></media:thumbnail>

<content>
<![CDATA[
<p>Native advertising is one of the hottest trends in the world of business. A simple online ad can reach millions of people, and some of those readers might not even realize that the content contains an advertisement. More company owners now hope to use similar ads to aid with business growth.</p>

<p>
<strong>Why Use Native Advertising?</strong></p>

<p> Customers can quickly pan across an article and read the content in minutes without once noticing the ads and banners on the website. When you use a native ad, you can reach more customers, because those shoppers assume that it is part of the article. As more shoppers begin using tablets and smartphones when shopping, you can target your ads to your client base.</p>

<p>Note that certain types of native advertising can be controversial if readers feel they're being tricked by the ad. One notable 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/index.html#nav_apparel_giveaways_promotional_items">native advertising</a> campaign launched early in 2013 when the Church of Scientology ran an ad detailing its history and successes. However, that ad received considerable criticism from the site that ran it, and the ad was quickly discontinued. Some began to refer to January 15 as Mock Native Advertising Day. This is why it's important to be careful with sponsored content integration and related types of native advertising.</p>

<p>
<strong>Older Ad Methods</strong></p>

<p> Businesses gain customers by running ads on television, but more businesses now understand that many customers discover new products and services through the Internet. Early Internet ads were rudimentary, featuring bright colors and eye-catching graphics that sometimes turned customers off. Depending on the website and the ad colors, ads nowadays can even remain hidden on the edges of the site.</p>

<p>The other problem some have with traditional Internet ads is that those ads appear jumbled with others. One website might run ten or more ads, and the readers of that site might never click on a single ad. The most successful websites are those with a high click-through rate, which refers to the number of readers who click the ad banners.</p>

<p>
<strong>Pricing and Problems</strong></p>

<p> The current price of native advertising depends on the size of the ad and the number of people who visit that website. Some of the newest technologies help with 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Desktop-Computers/cat_CL167288">business growth</a> because they let businesses post ads on social networking sites such as Twitter and Tumblr. The main issue with these ads is that some customers might find the advertising deceptive, as with the Scientology campaign. When someone reads a large chunk of information, that person expects to find something helpful inside, not another ad.</p>

<p>The trick to making this type of advertising work is to target the right market. Certain websites are better suited for ads from specific companies. With technology like embedded videos and interactive maps, this advertising is a successful way to target customers. ?</p>

<title>Laptop Review: The Lenovo Ideapad Yoga</title>
<description>The Lenovo offers big advantages to users willing to live with the drawbacks of its dual identity.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Tech experts, shoppers and other visitors were abuzz at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show in the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Lenovo® Ideapad Yoga 13 was living up to its name. This Ultrabook Convertible, as Intel® calls it, is a hybrid species of tablet and notebook. Engineered with smooth, rotating hinges, this device easily moves between four different positions. Considered one of the hottest products at the CES, the Lenovo offers big advantages to users willing to live with the drawbacks of its dual identity.</p>

<p> 
<strong>Four Poses for Improved Time Management </strong></p>

<p>It is difficult to find a tech review that does not acknowledge the benefit of having two functions in one device. The Ideapad's swivel-hinge design is called the Lenovo Transition, and it allows users to automatically switch settings when changing positionsor poses, if you will. Each pose corresponds to a function: laptop, tablet, tent, or stand.</p>

<p>This 360-degree movement makes it a convenient computer in a variety of settings and also expedites the creation, sharing and consumption of content without giving users the awkward chore of switching devices. The Yoga's InstantResume feature saves extra time, allowing the instrument to instantly switch from sleep mode to readiness.</p>

<p>
<strong> New Innovations and Applications</strong></p>

<p> The 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/lenovo+ideapad+yoga/directory_lenovo+ideapad+yoga">Lenovo Ideapad Yoga </a>series runs on the Windows 8 operating system. This technology is compatible with keyboards and touchscreens, both comfortably housed in the Lenovo.</p>

<p>Switching between applications more swiftly and efficiently than Windows 7, Windows 8 can absorb all the files, applications, and settings of previous systems while running newer applications such as Xbox Music. You can pinch and stretch images to zoom in and out, bypassing the usual bother of enlargement. The Lenovo touchscreen's sensitivity allows the use of all ten fingers, optimizing the blessings Windows 8 provides.</p>

<p>
<strong>Challenges and Cost</strong></p>

<p> While the responsive touchscreen is an asset to the dexterous, tech reviews suggest that it can occasionally annoy the less nimble. Some users also find holding the tablet in certain positions uncomfortable, because the keyboard is on the flipside. While these issues amount to minor irritants, consumers should handle the Lenovo Ideapad Yoga prior to purchase to determine their own comfort levels. Some 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/All-Laptop-Computers-Mktg-Non-Searchable/cat_CL167289 ">laptop reviews</a> by business users also complain about the position of the power button. It's located on the device's front edge, making accidental activation more likely. Tech reviews note that the device's maximum RAM is 8GB. At its most basic, the Lenovo Ideapad Yoga costs about $1,000.</p>

<p>The laptop review in a nutshell: Overall, the Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 13 is a versatile computer that will save you time and improve your personal and commercial productivity. The light weight and flexibility make it perfect for use on work, home and travel use. Because the device employs cloud storage technology, you can access your Ultrabook from any other device. For busy professionals and entrepreneurs, the Lenovo Ideapad Yoga will deliver with maximum efficacy.</p>

<title>Internet Video Interviews: The Recruiting Tools Your Business Is Missing?</title>
<description>Save money and improve your recruiting results by learning how to conduct effective video interviews.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>As a business owner, you should use tools that help you identify the best employees for your company at the lowest possible cost. Video interviews can help you get to know potential employees in a virtual setting, eliminating the need to meet with candidates in your office. Save money and improve your recruiting results by learning how to conduct effective video interviews.</p>

<p> 
<strong>Preparing for Interviews</strong></p>

<p> How long it takes you to fill a job opening has a direct effect on your bottom line. The longer you go without hiring someone, the more work your other employees have to do. If the open position is critical to your business, you might even miss project deadlines. This can cost money and damage your relationships with customers. One of the first things you should do when scheduling interviews is set a time limit for each interview. This will save time and increase productivity. Several easy-to-use products can help you complete this process.</p>

<p>
<strong>What You'll Need</strong></p>

<p> The next step is to choose the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Webcams/cat_CL140467">recruiting tools</a> you will use. You can conduct a video interview with a simple webcam and an inexpensive microphone. When shopping for these tools, make sure each piece of equipment is compatible with your computer and operating system. Older webcam models sometimes produced grainy images, but newer models produce high-quality images that make it easy for you to pay attention to a candidate's body language and facial expressions in video interviews.</p>

<p>Conducting a video interview is especially helpful if you plan to interview candidates from other states or countries. Instead of paying for their travel expenses, you can interview them via webcam. Some companies also offer a service that lets you create virtual interview rooms. You can invite candidates to these rooms to make the interview process easier to organize.</p>

<p>
<strong>Costs and Pitfalls of Video Interviewing</strong></p>

<p> Before purchasing a webcam or microphone, be aware of some of the pitfalls associated with these types of equipment. One possible problem is that the webcam might not produce an image. This could be due to something as simple as a loose connection between your computer and the webcam's USB cable. Some webcams activate automatically, but you might have to adjust yours manually. You might also have to update the device drivers for your webcam if you experience problems. If you do not want to purchase a separate webcam and microphone, consider purchasing a laptop with an integrated webcam. A laptop can be one of the most valuable recruiting tools in your arsenal, because you can use the integrated webcam to conduct 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/All-Laptop-Computers/cat_CL167289">video interviews</a> and use the laptop's other features to take notes.</p>

<p>The cost of using video interviews for your business depends on whether you purchase an inexpensive webcam or decide to upgrade your computer equipment by purchasing a laptop. A laptop can cost as little as $300 for a basic model to several thousand dollars for an advanced model with a large screen, fast processor, and significant amount of memory. If you decide to buy a webcam, expect to spend as little as $10 for a basic model and as much as $250 for an advanced model that produces high-definition images. Some microphones cost less than $10, while professional models cost up to $150.</p>

<p>
<strong> Getting the Most for Your Money</strong></p>

<p> If you want to cut recruiting costs and save time, invest in tools that will help you do so. Be sure to pick products that will work with your particular laptop or desktop computer model. Use these recruiting tools to identify great job candidates who can help you take your business to the next level. ?</p>

<title>Changing Company Culture: What Your Business Culture Says about You</title>
<description>Before you can change your business culture, you have to identify just what that culture is.</description>

<content>
<![CDATA[
<p>Every business has a basic way of doing things. This attitude carries throughout the company, from upper management to the newest employees. Whether it concerns general company goals, suggestion of new project ideas, or a casual dress code on Fridays, this combination of methods and procedures specific to the company comprises its company culture.</p>

<p>
<strong>Setting the Groundwork for Change</strong></p>

<p> Company culture can affect all aspects of a business, with traditional rules becoming so entrenched that change is immediately dismissed. At times, however, a change in the way of doing business is not just desirable, but also necessary.</p>

<p>Before you can change your business culture, you have to identify just what that culture is. Doing so requires close study of company procedures, both those that were implemented due to official directives and those that developed over time. Once you've determined precisely what your current company culture is, you can begin targeting the specific aspects of that company culture that you wish to change.</p>

<p>Begin by creating an entirely new mission statement. The mission statement helps to define just what your company's goals are and what how the management intends to obtain those goals. When you've created the new mission statement, include it in the company's business plan, making any changes in the plan necessary to reflect the new 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Business-Plan-Pro-Complete-Boxed-CD/product_369328">company culture</a> you're trying to establish.</p>

<p>
<strong> Change from the Top</strong></p>

<p> Implementation of the change in company culture has to start at the top of the business hierarchy. Begin by meeting with senior management and making certain that the newly desired culture is fully understood.</p>

<p>The mission statement is only the beginning of making the cultural change needed, and the full scope of the change must be communicated throughout the workforce. Make sure to include the new mission statement, as well as a general explanation of the desired 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Small-Business-Advantage-3/product_329311">business culture</a>, in the employee handbook, so all employees are aware of the changes being implemented.</p>

<p>With this new information in hand, senior managers can begin making changes in individual areas of responsibility, always making sure that the changes are explained to workers at all levels of employment. Change is generally gradual, and the more entrenched the current culture is, the harder it will be to change current company thinking. For this reason, you need to work downward through the hierarchy, as all changes must be continually reinforced until the new culture becomes as natural as the old one.</p>

<p>
<strong>Doing It the Company Way</strong></p>

<p> A strong business culture provides many advantages by reflecting the ideals of the company owner and giving workers a consistent idea of the company's general goals and guidelines. While change takes considerable effort, once it's been fully adapted at all levels of the company, a new culture can breathe new life into workers, reaffirming company goals while providing a feeling of inclusion.</p>

<title>5 Inbound Marketing Tips to Grow Your Business</title>
<description>These five inbound marketing tips will help you grow your business using the power of the Internet.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Inbound marketing refers to content and information that draws customers to seek out your business. Generally, it's used when discussing Web content such as blogs, e-books, and other valuable reference materials that cost you nothing to distribute but time. These five inbound marketing tips will help you grow your business using the power of the Internet.</p>

<p>
<strong>Employ Strong Site Design</strong></p>

<p>A foundational 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Professor-Teaches-Web-Design-Fundamentals-for-Windows-1-User-Download/product_416204">inbound marketing tip</a> is to focus on useful Web design systems such as Professor Teaches Web Design Fundamentals for Windows. Start with a Web design program such as Adobe Dreamweaver or NetObjects Fusion and learn how to create great-looking, easy-to-navigate sites. A site that's easy to use will bring customers back, and good design is critical for this.</p>

<p>
<strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></p>

<p>The next inbound marketing tip: Once your website is live, you need customers to find it. Another inbound marketing tip is to learn about search engine optimization (SEO). This refers to optimizing how well your site ranks when a potential customer searches for a product or service you sell.</p>

<p>There are many ways to do this, but there are no shortcuts; never trust anyone who claims to be able to improve your site's ranking considerably without adding high-quality, relevant content to the site. Start writing your blog. Look for others who are creating content that works well with yours; for instance, if you're a contractor, create a blog about what consumers should look for in quality homes and ask your vendors and others to link to your site in exchange for you writing about their products and linking back to them. This combination of content and linking should improve your SEO quickly.</p>

<p>
<strong>Promote Your Site</strong></p>

<p>Inbound marketing tip number three: Talk about your website any time you interact online. You should link to it in the default signature field of your email and draw attention to it in your social media interactions. When you've created a new post on your blog, post it, link to it on Facebook, and also tweet it. Include a link to your website whenever you can. This is one of the most key inbound marketing tips.</p>

<p>
<strong>Content Is Key</strong></p>

<p>Once you've started getting interest in your website content, it's time to look at ways to expand. Just as you expand your business, you want to expand your content offerings.

<title>Top Sleek Shopkeep: Running a Small Business from Anywhere</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>With advances in mobile and cloud technology in the last few years, running your business will never be the same. In fact, you can set up shop with just a smartphone, tablet or laptop with a mobile hotspot from your phone company. The advantages are obvious: You can spend less money on infrastructure and run your business with minimal fixed costs, which will help boost profits.</p>

<p>
<strong>A Business Revolution</strong></p>

<p>With the development of easy-to-carry devices such as 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/tablets/directory_tablets">tablets</a>, you can potentially run your business from a different location every day. This is especially true if your business doesn't deal in hands-on handling of merchandise  such as companies that specialized in writing, affiliate marketing and website operation.</p>

<p>What has really created a new sense of freedom for small business owners in the last two years is the ability to run credit card payments and checks through software that can be run from a laptop, tablet or phone. Point-of-sale software (POS) is often the lifeblood of running a small business. If you can take a payment via credit card through your tablet and have it automatically approved and deposited in your bank account, you are liberated from the lag time involved with converting your payment into usable funds. You can also save your business information on a cloud drive, so you do not need physical space to store your files.</p>

<p>
<strong>How POS Software Works</strong></p>

<p>In the past, anyone who traveled and sold products or services in various towns had to take payments either by paper check or by using what retailers fondly call the "knuckle buster," a mechanism with a slider to imprint credit cards. Then you either had to mail the deposit to your bank, take it there in person or call it in to your credit card company. It was a cumbersome and time-consuming process.</p>

<p>The first improvement in taking payments while 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/point+of+sale+software/directory_point+of+sale+software">running a small business</a> was a swiper mechanism that scans your credit card at a POS area. While this software has improved over the years, the essence of it hasn't changed much. You need a phone line to connect it to the bank's system. After the customer pays, the money is deposited in the bank one to three days after the sale.</p>

<p>Another advance for taking payments was the ability to run credit cards through a cell phone. However, this wasnt always ideal, because you had to pay for cell phone service, and the reception was often spotty. This type of setup did allow small businesses the ability to have a confirmed payment at various locations (assuming cell service was available).</p>

<p>In the last two years, these previous developments have become virtually obsolete. The latest development in mobile POS is the use of smartphone technology. Because smartphones have the ability to process data independent of cell phone lines, you can now run a small business entirely over the Internet.</p>

<p>
<strong>Pros and Cons of Mobile POS</strong></p>

<p>There are very few cons to mobile POS outside of buying the basic hardware required. When running a business, a smartphone or tablet is preferred, though systems will also run off of laptops. You will need to purchase an attachment that will work with your device. Some programs give you a free attachment, but some companies will charge you for the expense of the hardware in their fees. Other than those two investments, the only other cost is the actual fees to process credit cards and checks.</p>

<p>Today, mobile technology is very reliable for running a small business if youre in an area that has good Wi-Fi or cell service. If you aren't, you can bring your own hotspot with you. This essentially lets you run your business remotely from anywhere.</p>

<title>Too Much to Do: Using Small Business Efficiency to Get Work Done</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Productivity demands in the workplace are constantly rising, with fewer workers often expected to do a growing list of tasks in as little time as possible. While there are plenty of business efficiency products on the market, when faced with too much to do, most workers tend to rely on a few tried-and-true methods to boost personal efficiency and meet demands.</p>

<p>
<strong>Efficiency through Organization</strong></p>

<p>One of the primary reasons why workers can feel overwhelmed in the office is a lack of organization. As tasks build up, a lack of organization can quickly lead to workers facing an overflowing inbox and a slowdown in productivity.</p>

<p>A great way to fight disorganization is through creating a workflow process. To do this, you must first identify all your tasks and prioritize them based on importance.</p>

<p>Every task should be written down along with due dates and resources needed. Once you have your list of tasks, group them together according to shared resources, processes, or any other attribute that would allow you to work on multiple tasks at once and get work done.</p>

<p>After the tasks are grouped for maximum efficiency, arrange them by priority and completion date. Place them into a scheduler to allow you to view the tasks easily while you work according to the priority list. This will let you 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Organizer-Pro-7-Boxed-CD/product_410248">get work done</a> as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>
<strong>Keeping Track of Employee Time</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes theres simply too much to do. Tracking employees time spent on each task can determine whether they are working as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>To maximize 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Employee-Productivity-Time-Management-Software-for-Windows-Boxed-CD/product_410190">business efficiency</a>, the employees time should be spent wisely, preferably on as many profitable tasks as possible. There is software available that can help track employee productivity. By analyzing your employees work schedule, you can determine which tasks are worth the most and concentrate their time toward those. You can also find other methods to perform less profitable tasks, such as hiring freelancers or temp help or by redesigning the tasks to require less time.</p>

<p>
<strong>Small Business Efficiency</strong></p>

<p>In todays budget-crunched business environment, organizations have to rely on fewer employees to handle the workload. That means, some of your employees might feel maxed out. There are ways to combat this, including cross-training employees to handle one another's tasks and redistributing workloads throughout the company. Getting organized is a great way to help your employees get more done and alleviate feelings of being overwhelmed.</p>

<title>The Transforming Effects of Wireless Charging </title>
<description>As more technology becomes wireless, the value of induction charging will only grow.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Inductive charging was invented by Nicolai Tesla in 1890, but it's only recently become a major game-changer in today's technology. Also known as wireless charging, it uses the relationship between magnetism and electricity to recharge batteries without wired connections. Small devices are already using inductive charging. Cell phone charger mats, for instance, are commercially available, and so are inductive chargers for game system remotes. Today, researchers are working on ways to transmit wireless energy across much larger distances without interfering with electronics or broadcast waves. Your office in the not-too-distant future may allow all your electronic devices to recharge wirelessly and automatically.</p>

<p>
<strong>How This Technology Works</strong></p>

<p>Induction charging uses an induction coil to convert wired electrical energy into a powerful magnetic field. When electronic devices are placed in that field, the magnetism is converted back into electrical energy and stored in the battery. There are dozens of ways you might be able to use 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/HyperJuice-MBP-150-External-Battery-For-Apple-iPad-iPad-2-iPhone-Macbook/product_118227">wireless charging</a> in a small business, from a central cell phone charging station to a wireless electric car charger.</p>

<p>As more technology becomes wireless, the value of induction charging will only grow. Soon, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Conserve-Valet-Smart-USB-Charging-Station/product_910142">wireless charging</a> may be able to eliminate the ever-increasing Gordian knot of charging cords many of us carry around today, making it easier to keep our devices powered up and ready to go.</p>

<p>
<strong>How Your Business Can Adopt This Today</strong></p>

<p>Wireless charging technology is just starting to ramp up. In Madison Square Garden, iPhones with charger-compatible cases can be charged at pads located in corporate boxes. Starbucks and Delta Air Lines Sky Clubs are beginning to incorporate charging pads into tables and bars.</p>

<p>There are plans to develop sleeves and adapters for other mobile technologies such as laptops and tablet computers. Industry experts are predicting an explosion in wireless charging technology by 2015, and large companies such as Google and Samsung are already jockeying to be the dominant providers of induction products.</p>

<p>
<strong>Potential Problems</strong></p>

<p>Every new technology comes with its own set of potential obstacles, and induction charging is no different. A standards battle is already brewing, with one group of industries lining up in support of the PMA and another group supporting the Wireless Power Consortium. The Wireless Power Consortium may have an edge now, as its Qi chargers have been in market for awhile, but the PMA is increasingly well-funded and supported by giants such as Google and Duracell.</p>

<p>There's also the cost of wireless charging retrofitting. Although many wireless devices will have compatible charging sleeves, they will never be as efficient or fast-charging as devices created specifically for wireless charging. Cost, however, may not be one of the obstacles of wireless charging. As compatibility sleeves for smartphones are expected to cost only slightly more than standard mobile phone covers do today.</p>

<p>Induction charging technology has been around for more than 100 years, but its just now finding practical application in todays technology. Widespread early adoption perhaps is not imminent, due to the standards battle; however, business owners should read up on this new technology and consider investing in a wireless charging sleeve and charging pad for testing purposes.</p>

<title>Business Motivation 101: How to Keep Your Best Employees</title>
<description>Small business retention, are you keeping your best talent?</description>
<link>http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/business-motivation-101-how-to-keep-your-best-employees.html</link>

<![CDATA[
<p>Any business, no matter its size, is dependent on its employees to provide quality work and service in order to attract customers and keep them coming back. This is especially true among small businesses, which rely on high-quality employees at all levels. A challenge in small business motivation is the retention of the company's best employees. When opportunities to rise through the company ranks are limited by company size, it becomes necessary for the small business owner to find alternate ways to convince star employees to remain with the organization.</p>

<p>
<strong>Understanding Business Motivation</strong></p>

<p>Business motivation refers not only to why you're in business, but also how you motivate your employees to meet your particular business goals. Before you can retain your most effective employees, it's important to precisely determine your business goals. This requires more than a quick glance at a business plan. To gain a true grasp of your business goals, you have to look at not only the long-term plans, but also at the ways in which you intend to conduct business, from manufacturing procedures to how you handle customer interactions. With a full idea of the business culture in mind, you can begin coming up with ways to best fit star employees. That helps you increase employee loyalty and raise retention rates.</p>

<p>Once you better understand business motivation, you need to begin to understand which of the employees you need to retain. Speaking to an employee's immediate supervisor can give you a good deal of insight into their working method. You should also do an in-depth study into how each employee's duties are being covered, paying close attention to precisely which ones are taking up the majority of time. Using a productivity and time management software package is a good way to determine just what your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Employee-Productivity-Time-Management-Software-for-Windows-Boxed-CD/product_410190">best employees</a> are keeping busy with.</p>

<p>
<strong>Fitting the Employee into the Right Place</strong></p>

<p>Once you have a solid grasp on an employee's activities and work habits, it's time for a discussion. Because business motivation is just as much about keeping the employee motivated, you need to determine the best way to keep the star employee happy and performing the tasks that are deemed crucial to the company. During your conversation, ask where they see himself or herself moving within the company  not simply in terms of a promotion but with overall duties. You should play to the employee's strengths whenever possible, choosing duties that are most compatible, so that you can gain as much effectiveness as possible. Move the employee to a new position that takes advantages of those strengths, or create a new position if needed.</p>

<p>Once you've found a position that satisfies the needs of the employee and your company, you should continue to keep track of their performance. Perform regular reviews while offering whatever aid is needed to ensure that the employee and the position mesh well, ensuring that they become an even more vital part of your core 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/ComplyRight-Management-Training-Managing-Employees-Performance-Legally-Effectively-DVD/product_711962">business motivation</a> plan.</p>

<p>
<strong>Keeping Your Best Employees</strong></p>

<p>Every employee is different, so every retention plan will change. As long as you can find ways to keep your employees motivated that fit in your core business ideals, you should be able to retain those high-quality employees within your organization. With the right employees in the proper places, you can concentrate on making certain that they grow along with your company.</p>

<title>Are Your Online Content Copyrighting Concerns Valid? </title>
<description>It's important to know how copyright relates to online content and how to protect your work.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>In 2013, having high-quality online content on your website is critical to ranking well with search engines such as Google. Web content is big business these days, but the obvious downside to posting something online is the possibility that someone will steal it for his or her own use. Sometimes its spun" through a computer program to obscure the theft, but sometimes your content can just show up verbatim on another site. It's important to know how copyright relates to online content and how to protect your work.</p>

<p>
<strong>Online Content</strong></p>

<p>
<strong></strong>First off, be aware that 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/index.html">online content</a> doesn't just refer to words: It can also be images, audio, or video content. This means that anything you post or see online can potentially have a copyright. If you are a business owner, especially a small business owner, you need to post content online in some form as part of your content strategy. Whether you write posts for a blog, post products for sale on your ecommerce site, or have images of your photography, you use online content to communicate with your customers.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems with the theft of online content is that the original owner may not even know that it has been copied. That is because, unlike stealing a diamond necklace from your home, your copy is still left on your original website.</p>

<p>
<strong>Combating Content Thieves</strong></p>

<p>The reality of the Internet is that sometime, now or in the future, you are likely to have some of your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesProductDisplay?storeId=10001&amp;amp;partNumber=955461&amp;amp;catalogIdentifier=2&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;ddkey=http:StaplesZipCodeAdd">web content</a> stolen. You will have to decide whether your online content is worth copyrightingand if so, at what level.</p>

<p>There is a difference between content that describes a product and a piece of original poetry. Most manufacturers who make products want their descriptions copied so that their distributors have good product descriptions. On the other hand, a poet doesn't want his or her original poetry used without permission. This is where online copyrighting comes into play.</p>

<p>You can copyright online content with a Creative Commons license, which provides partial permission for use of your content in specific circumstances. You can also fully copyright online content. Additionally, for image content, you can add a watermark to your image. These methods of adding a copyright to online content do work.</p>

<p>
<strong>Dealing with Stolen Content</strong></p>

<p>There are several ways of dealing with stolen content:</p>

<ul>

<li>You can ignore it. If the content helps promote your business or is not important to you, there's no requirement to do anything.</li>

<li>You can choose a content strategy where you only post content that you don't mind being stolen.</li>

<li>You can contact the content thief directly and request that your content be removed from the site. It's possible that the person just doesn't know the rules of the road.</li>

<li>You can file a DMCA report with the website owner, the hosting company, Google and anyone else concerned. This can get the content or website taken down, though these processes often take time.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do decide to take action, keep in mind that it will take time out of your day that you could be using to pursue business concerns that might be more important. That is why you need to decide whether you should stop content theft before it happens by not putting proprietary material online in the first place.</p>

<p>Choosing to put your content online comes with some inherent risks. Content theft happens regularly, and you have to decide how to manage your material. If you can watermark content, that works the best. Otherwise, you may be wise to limit what content you put on the Web.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>A company's relationship with its customers can be the make-or-break variable in its success formula. Good customer relations often ensure return business and positive word of mouth that keep new customers coming back. Improving customer relationships should be a priority for any company, beginning with the old adage that the customer is always right.</p>

<p>
<strong>Catering to the Customer</strong></p>

<p>Catering to your customers' wants, whatever they might be, is the basis of good customer relationships. The saying that the customer is always right is a way to remind business owners that all customer transactions should be geared toward serving them. By giving customers precisely what they want, you create happy consumers who are more likely to return for more of your particular product or service.</p>

<p>Just as important as a satisfactory sale is customer aftercare. Improving customer relations is easy if you take as much care in seeing that the customer remains satisfied with a purchase as you did in making the initial sale. This will require customer service being able to quickly and efficiently handling any negative issues that may arise after a transaction.</p>

<p>Keeping in contact with customers is also a good method of improving 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Fortune-100-Gold-Customer-Relationship-Manager-Boxed-CD/product_410217">customer relationships</a>. The use of customer relationship management software allows you to maintain a database on customers. The information in the database can include anything from contact information and a mailing list to notes on each customer's preferences. This data will allow salespeople to better cater to the customer during each return engagement.</p>

<p>
<strong>Improving Customer Relationships Online</strong></p>

<p>Even if you have a traditional brick-and-mortar business, having an online presence is vital to improving customer satisfaction. A large part of customer relations is communications, and having an online presence allows you to communicate with customers on a regular basis through multiple avenues.</p>

<p>A basic website goes a long way in establishing your online presence. Even a static webpage gives customers the opportunity to search for your company and allows you to communicate important information such as product lines, business location, and contact information. To truly connect with the customer and maintain good customer relations, however, you'll want to engage in an ongoing conversation.</p>

<p>Social media makes this easy. By using social avenues such as Twitter and Facebook, you can establish a community centered on your business, where customers can take part. This customer relationship tool provides you with your own digital soapbox, a forum for presenting new products and services, marketing ideas, or simply a place to answer any questions customers may have.</p>

<p>Establishing a social media community also allows you to invite your friends and followers to receive further information from your company through email. This creates a targeted list of individuals who actually wish to hear from you. With software designed specifically for creating email campaigns and handling large lists, the process of direct communication to improve 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Cakemail-APP-CENTER/product_100391">customer service</a> is quick and easy.</p>

<p>
<strong>Small Business Efficiency</strong></p>

<p>Improving customer satisfaction is the best way to keep them coming back. Making sure that customers are satisfied both during and after the sale keeps them happy. Establishing yourself online also helps greatly, allowing you to connect with the customer no matter where they might be.</p>

<title>All in the Name: Optimally Naming Your Business in 2013</title>
<description>Naming your business is one of the most important decisions a new business owner can make.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Naming your business is one of the most important decisions a new business owner can make. Too often, new owners do not put much thought into a name, but they should. A business name actually has the power to make or break a company. If it isn't catchy, doesn't relate closely enough to the nature of the business, or is confusing, that can be incredibly damaging.</p>

<p>
<strong>What's in a Name</strong></p>

<p>Across the board, business consultants agree that 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/marketing/directory_marketing">naming your business</a> is an important task. However, they do not all necessarily agree on how to choose a name.</p>

<p>As an entrepreneur, you should start by making a conscious decision to name your company. Don't let your company get its name by default. The company's name is the way that customers, competitors and vendors will identify your business. A great name can help you grow faster, and a poor name can slow your growth or even hurt your business.</p>

<p>
<strong>Steps You Can Take to Search for a Name</strong></p>

<p>There are two schools of thought when it comes to naming your business. The first is to use words that relate to or describe what you do. The second is to choose a short, easy-to-pronounce name that can be easily branded. This second philosophy allows you more creativity in naming your business and controlling the perception through marketing and media.</p>

<p>Whichever option you choose, there are certain steps to take:</p>

<ul>

<li>Think about how the name sounds when said out loud.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Make sure it is easy to spell.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Search the Internet for similar names, and avoid any that are too close.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Consider whether you may incorporate your business as you grow.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Consider whether the name is transferable if you choose to sell your business.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Naming Pitfalls</strong></p>

<p>One of the key steps when you start a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Business-Essentials-Suite-for-Mac-and-Windows-Boxed-CD/product_410184">business in 2013</a> is choosing a name. Naming a business can have some pitfalls, and sometimes there are costs involved. If you believe your business will grow large enough to incorporate or trademark, it's critical that you not select a name someone else already has registered. Do a thorough search for similar names.</p>

<p>Naming your business does not have to be a solitary task, but it can be problematic if you ask family members or a large group of people to help. While that might seem like a natural option, it can make things too complicated. Hire a consultant to help you or only ask for ideas from a few select people. Having too many helpers can stir up resentment and stress.</p>

<p>Everyone who starts a new business in 2013 will have to give extensive consideration to the company's name. Look for a marketable name that is easy to say and hard to forget. Naming your business is a critical job, so take your time and do it right. You want customers to remember your business positively and spread the name around to their friends.</p>

<title>The Top 10 Online Advertising Questions to Ask Yourself</title>
<description>Consider these ten advertising questions in the context of your business and its goal.</description>
<link>http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-top-10-online-advertising-questions-to-ask-yourself.html</link>
<media:thumbnail url="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/images/res/29_top_10_online_advertising_questions.jpg"></media:thumbnail>
<pubDate>21 Feb 2013 13:48:40 GMT</pubDate>
<content>
<![CDATA[
<p>Online advertising has become essential for businesses that wish to gain new customers and improve sales. Yesterday's advertising campaignsones centered around radio, television, and printnow reach smaller and smaller numbers, while Internet use continues to rise. How do you navigate the sometimes tangled web that is online advertising?</p>

<p>
<strong>1. What Is Your Market?</strong></p>

<p>Who do you sell to? Does your product appeal to a particular gender or age group? What about location? Do you sell only in a certain area? If your marketing and advertising plan does not consider these factors, you'll waste money and effort by targeting people who are not interested in your product or service, while missing those who are.</p>

<p>
<strong>2. Where Does Your Market Go Online?</strong></p>

<p>Once you have identified your customer group for online advertising, find out where those people spend time online. Powerful (and free) analytical tools can help you determine where people go online to look for products and services like yours, so you can target ads in those locations.</p>

<p>
<strong>3. What Social Media Outlets Are Best for You?</strong></p>

<p>Social media is growing quickly, and it's not just about being social anymore. Social media also provides a platform where you can find and interact with customers. But with so many outlets to choose from, which should you use? Facebook can help you connect with fans of your company and find out what matters to them. Visual sites such as Pinterest and Instagram help you show your customers what you have to offer. The social media outlets you utilize should match the product or service you are promoting.</p>

<p>
<strong>4. Can Customers Find You on the Internet?</strong></p>

<p>When customers search for your product or business, can they find you? Is your website optimized for search engines? What keywords do customers use to find your business? If you don't know these answers, it's time to find out. An online presence is only effective if people know you're there.</p>

<p>
<strong>5. What about Marketing to Mobile Customers?</strong></p>

<p>Almost half of Americans already own smartphones. That means a huge segment of the population may be looking for you right at the moment they are ready to shop. Are you ready for them? Mobile advertising is not as important as having your content set up for mobile access. Customers rarely click on mobile ads, but they are looking for engaging and helpful content, so consider this in your online advertising.</p>

<p>
<strong>6. What Makes You Memorable?</strong></p>

<p>What makes your business stick in people's minds? Is it your logo? A recognizable tune? Whatever it is, make sure you apply it consistently across your online advertising campaign. Wherever customers find you, whether it's on social media sites, on your website, or in ads, they should see the same memorable image that connects to your company.</p>

<p>
<strong>7. Are Your Employees Ready?</strong></p>

<p>If your employees are going to be equipped to market effectively and respond to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/PCs-Laptops-Tablets/cat_CG71">advertising questions</a> quickly, they need the right equipment. Whether they are setting up advertising budgets using Google's Adwords or tweeting your latest company announcements, they need fast, reliable computers.</p>

<p>
<strong>8. Who Can Help?</strong></p>

<p>Depending on your business, you can use websites, bloggers, and social media specialists to help you craft your message and deliver it to your customers effectively. Maybe you don't have the time or expertise to focus on your online presence, but there are professionals who specialize in this process and are ready to help.</p>

<p>
<strong>9. How Will This Affect My Advertising Budget?</strong></p>

<p>If you have not looked at your advertising budget in a few years, it's likely due for a change anyway. You can launch inexpensive ad campaigns using social media, or you can spend thousands of dollars purchasing space for your ads at popular landing places on the Web. Remember that 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/QuickBooks-Premier-2013-for-Windows-1-User-Boxed/product_957738">online advertising</a> and sales can have a unique effect on your accounting and taxes, due to how state sales taxes are applied to online transactions.</p>

<p>
<strong>10. How Will I Know if This Works?</strong></p>

<p>The great thing about advertising and doing business online is the immense amount of data available to you. You can easily find out how many people are clicking on your ads, where they are coming from, and whether they buy anything on your site. Advertising should always be fluid and responsive, and the many analytical tools make it simpler than ever to gauge the effectiveness of your advertising.</p>

<p>There are plenty of things competing for your attention as a business owner. Online advertising is a massive arena for getting the word out and establishing a presence. Ask yourself these ten questions before you spend the time and money needed to begin a successful campaign.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>For businesses, social media is a way to communicate with the public. Using social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter allows a business to actively engage with customers, vendors, or anyone else interested in what the business has to say. However, for this social media engagement to work, a business needs to be able to drive the conversation in a way that benefits the company, while also keeping the growing community it's building interested in continuing the conversation.</p>

<p>
<strong>Driving the Conversation</strong></p>

<p>The rise of social media marks a new era in business communications. Before the advent of social media communities, business communications were largely limited to a one-way dispersal of information. With modern social media, communication suddenly became a two-way street, with instant feedback from the public.</p>

<p>Because the communication goes both ways, it's important for a business to ensure some control of the conversation. This is done by engaging the public in a way that keeps the discussion active and on topic. Business communication through social media is often used as a marketing tool: Asking 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Rhino-Group-Social-Media-Marketing-For-Dummies-Training-Series-for-Windows-1/product_944366">the right questions</a> keeps the conversation going in the right direction.</p>

<p>The right questions are any that get the community to respond without harming the business' image in the process. A question does not even have to be directly related to the products or services offered by the business. It only needs to keep the conversation going and the community members returning for more.</p>

<p>
<strong>Building the Community</strong></p>

<p>The ongoing conversation between the business and the public is a basic method of community building in the social media environment.</p>

<p>Building a community through social media engagement takes time and effort. Asking the right questions is only part of what it takes to keep the public interested and the community growing. You also have to be prepared to answer questions posed to you. Being responsive to the community makes the public feel welcome and will keep individuals returning to your social media site repeatedly.</p>

<p>Its also a good idea to build relationships with engaged core members. These individuals can help steer overall conversations in a beneficial direction.</p>

<p>The community you build through 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Cakemail-APP-CENTER/product_100391">social media engagement</a> can extend beyond the social media site itself. You can invite community members to join your business' website or contact list and use that list to market directly those who choose to opt in.</p>

<p>Conversation is the key to social media engagement. Driving that conversation allows you to make the most effective use of the social media environment, which in turn allows you to build a community around your company. This community can then be used to communicate directly with potential customers.</p>

<title>The Freemium Model: Is Acquiring Customers Worth the Cost?</title>
<description>The freemium model of pricing is one price method geared toward attracting customers.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Acquiring new customers and retaining those who have already purchased products or services should be a primary concern for any organization. A great deal of thought goes into developing acquisition and retention methods, including setting the price for the goods or services. The freemium model of pricing is one price method geared toward attracting customers.</p>

<p>
<strong>What is the Freemium Model?</strong></p>

<p>The freemium model is a hybrid pricing model that starts out free of charge to customers, but the company then offers a premium version available for a price to those same customers. The free version is intended to provide the customer with a large enough sample of the premium product or service that the customer will then feel inclined to pay the premium price to receive the full version.</p>

<p>The freemium model of pricing is not new. It was often used by software companies in the 1980s to sell shareware or lite versions of retail software.</p>

<p>Copying a piece of software for distribution was inexpensive at the time, requiring the cost of a floppy disc or a CD-ROM for distribution. A stripped version of the full premium piece of software would be burned onto the disc. Often, the stripped version would be time-limited or have many more advanced features removed. Some free software versions would retain access to all of the features but not allow users to save anything produced with the software. No matter the approach used, the desired result was to have the customer pay for the premium version containing the full piece of software.</p>

<p>
<strong>How the Freemium Model is used today</strong></p>

<p>Freemium model pricing is still being used today, largely in the software world, where placing restriction on the use of certain sections of code is easy. Lite versions of popular software still exist, providing enough key features to make 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Fortune-100-Gold-Customer-Relationship-Manager-Boxed-CD/product_410217">freemium</a> users opt for the highly priced premium versions. However, some software companies offer their lite versions at a reduced rate, rather than for free.</p>

<p>Freemium pricing is also gaining popularity in Web-based services such as online productivity software or online games. Many of these services operate like the shareware versions of software once released on floppy disc or CD. Now, however, users are offered a slightly reduced user experience with premium add-onsor, in some game titles, upgradesfor a price.</p>

<p>
<strong>Targeting relevant customers</strong></p>

<p>Any company considering a freemium pricing model must determine if there truly is a way of monetizing its free customers into premium users. One popular method is the cross-sell. By requiring free users to accept advertising or emails sent from the product or service provider, the customer base becomes one large marketing pool. Developing a marketing campaign targeted at these customers is easier than going after random individuals, because the company producing the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Cakemail-APP-CENTER/product_100391">freemium model</a> product already has some idea of the customer's tastes.</p>

<p>Freemium model pricing can be a sustainable and profitable if the free version of the product or service provides enough inherent value to prompt the user into purchasing the premium content. The freemium model is a way to get the product or service into the hands of the customer early on and hook that person without having to face the initial resistance of a buying decision.</p>

<title>A Second Opinion: Business Consulting and Company Logistics</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Whether you're starting a business or planning for future business growth, getting a second opinion from a business consulting firm that specializes in company logistics can make a huge difference in your success. A logistics consultant helps companies analyze the entire supply chain to identify any problems the company may have with its warehouse, handling materials, or distribution. The goal of a business consulting specialist is to help business owners create a streamlined process that cuts costs and maximizes profits.</p>

<p>
<strong>Creating a Productive Work Environment</strong></p>

<p>Your business consulting specialist will go through your entire distribution process and help you come up with ideas to create a productive work environment. This could include rearranging your warehouse setup to make it easier to find products, implementing new computer software so it's easier to track the shipments your company receives, or creating a system to track outgoing shipments. To ensure maximum profits, you need to make it easy for your employees to be as productive as possible throughout the workday. Ensuring that your workplace is set up as efficiently and effectively as possible also helps ensure employee satisfaction and encourages productivity. No one wants to do a job that requires many unnecessary steps to accomplish a goal.</p>

<p>
<strong>Purchasing the Right Equipment</strong></p>

<p>When you're streamlining your company's shipping and distribution process, it's important to choose the right 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Envelopes-Labels-Mailing/cat_SC1679">company logistics</a> supplies. Keep a generous stock of packaging supplies such as envelopes, boxes, shipping tape, and shipping labels on hand. Keeping them handy ensures that employees don't have to search for items they need to get shipments prepared and out the door.</p>

<p>Once you've decided what type of shipping supplies your company needs to keep in stock, you can decide how and where you're going to store the supplies. You should work closely with your business consulting specialist to create a floor plan in your warehouse that maximizes productivity. For instance, packing and shipping supplies should be stored in a central location where employees can access them quickly.</p>

<p>
<strong>Cost of Streamlining Your Business</strong></p>

<p>The cost of reorganizing and streamlining your distribution process will vary depending on the size of your business. If you own a small business, you can probably create an efficient distribution area for less than $1,000. If you own a medium or large business, your costs could be higher. You need to consider the costs of shelving, office furniture, computer equipment, computer software, and shipping supplies. If you're worried about the costs, your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Software-Apps-Tech-Support/cat_SC1941">business consulting</a> specialist can help you decide which items are essential to your business' productivity. Keep in mind that by streamlining your business' entire distribution process, you're creating a long-term plan that's designed to cut costs and increase your profits.</p>

<p>Whether you're trying to create a plan that increases your current business productivity or starting a new business, hiring a business consulting specialist gives you a fresh point of view. Discovering areas where your business is lacking and correcting those problems is a great way to increase your profits on a long-term basis.</p>

<title>A Match Made in Heaven: Working with Vendors with Maximum Efficiency</title>
<description>An efficient vendor relationship begins with vendor choice.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>As a business owner, you know that few companies are able to handle all aspects of doing business alone. Whether a small business requires raw materials to manufacture a product or supplies to handle employee or customer needs, it often must partner with vendors to supply materials or services. Entering into a partnership such as this should not be done lightly; doing your research up front can ensure a smooth, and hopefully long-lasting, relationship.</p>

<p>
<strong>Establishing Vendor Relations</strong></p>

<p>Vendor quality can vary greatly, and even when vendors are known for providing great service, it's critical to determine how well they match the way you do business. To work with vendors who provide maximum efficiency, you'll need to be certain that your vendor's way of doing business aligns with how your company does business. The process of selecting a vendor should be handled with as much care as you would use in establishing any other business partnership.</p>

<p>Take the time to shop around extensively before choosing a vendor. Make a list of selection criteria and check each possible candidate against this list. You should research the possibilities closely, verifying the vendor's claims to ensure that you'll receive the product or services as promised.</p>

<p>Don't limit yourself to domestic vendors alone if you don't have to. In a globalized marketplace, it's sometimes better to seek out vendors on an international basis to find one that truly meshes with your company. Business translation software is available to make 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/SYSTRAN-7-Business-Translator-English-World-Pack-for-Windows-1-User-Download/product_955472">working with vendors</a> using documents in a foreign language easier.</p>

<p>
<strong>Working with Vendors</strong></p>

<p>Finding the best way to work with a vendor can mean the difference between a profitable relationship and a contentious one. A good working relationship begins with the initial contract.</p>

<p>Once you've chosen a vendor, don't hesitate to negotiate favorable terms for your contract. These terms can be anything from a trial period of six months (to ensure that your company and the vendor actually work well together) to negotiating expanded credit terms after a period of time.</p>

<p>Make sure that all aspects of the vendor relationship are spelled out in the contract, from products or services provided to conflict management methods, should an issue arise.</p>

<p>Work closely with the vendor throughout the contract period. You'll want to establish a consistent contact person. By keeping the same person as the point of contact, you can develop a more personal relationship.</p>

<p>Working with vendors requires that you keep careful track of all vendor transactions. Keeping a careful account of each transaction provides you with a paper trail should there be an issue with any of the transactions. Accounting software is available that can make this aspect of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/QuickBooks-Pro-2013-for-Windows-1-User-Boxed/product_957740">working with vendors</a> easy by allowing you to keep track of multiple vendors with up-to-the-minute data.</p>

<p>
<strong>Efficiency When Working with Vendors</strong></p>

<p>An efficient vendor relationship begins with vendor choice. By choosing a vendor whose methods of doing business closely match your own, you can lower miscommunications that may slow down operations between the two companies. Having all vendor expectations spelled out within the contract helps when working with vendors as well, ensuring that the vendor produces the goods or services contracted for on time.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Growing a business on a tight budget in a tough economy can be difficult. The more widespread your organization, the more juggling is required to grow your business when funds are limited. One method of growing your business under these conditions is to actually limit it a bit. By cutting your business down to its core, you can concentrate on its most profitable aspects, working with its strengths to grow it despite the economy's (or your own budget's) limitations.</p>

<p>
<strong>Developing Your Core</strong></p>

<p>Every business has a few core strengths, those areas in which the business is most capable of performing. When operating on a slim budget, it's best to concentrate on these core strengths.</p>

<p>Determine the core strengths of your business by examining each product line or service individually to find out that area's profitability. You also want to determine how much demand there is for each product and service. The idea is to find those products or services that not only provide high profit, but also hold up in tough economic times. A highly profitable product that's sold to a single customer may not be the optimal choice to concentrate on when compared to a slightly less profitable one that's sold to multiple customers.</p>

<p>Once you've determined which products or services are best for your company, concentrate on those particular profit centers. Cut back marginal areas and apply more funds and time into developing your strongest products or services. You could even go so far as to create a new business plan when faced with a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Business-Plan-Pro-Complete-Boxed-CD/product_369328">tight budget</a> tough economy, emphasizing the core areas on which you've chosen to concentrate.</p>

<p>
<strong>Training Your Employees</strong></p>

<p>A tight budget does not mean you should refrain from employee training. In fact, employee training should take on an even greater importance in your organization, because the more productive each employee is, the more profitable each will become.</p>

<p>The best way to save on training is to keep it internal whenever possible. Use experts within your own organization to train subordinates. You should also cross-train employees whenever possible to create an agile workforce capable of embracing new responsibilities smoothly and quickly. Software can aid in training your employees, letting you continuously evaluate their progress as you

<title>Fans and Followers: Boost Your Business with Social Media </title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Some business owners find themselves unsure of how to get followers on Twitter and fans on Facebook, but the process actually is fairly easy. Over the years, social networking has become a popular way for people to connect with friends and family online. Because so many people are drawn to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, it's become important for business owners to use these outlets to increase the customer base. Not only do social networking websites expose your business to a wide range of people, but Facebook and Twitter are great places to connect with your customers without spending a dime.</p>

<p>
<strong>Why Facebook and Twitter Are Important Business Tools</strong></p>

<p>Facebook and Twitter are important tools for business for two reasonsboth websites extremely popular and free to use. With so many people using social networking sites each day, you have the opportunity to connect with millions of potential customers. This is why so many business owners spend a lot of time researching 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Social-Media-Marketing-For-Dummies-30-Day-Access-for-Windows-1-User/product_954940">how to get followers.</a> They want to use sites like Facebook and Twitter to expand the customer base and increase profits.</p>

<p>
<strong>Make Connecting with Your Customers Easy</strong></p>

<p>There's one thing business owners need to understand about social networks before they decide to use these sites for business purposes: Social networking isn't about advertising; it's about connecting with other people. Therefore, you aren't likely to get followers by simply advertising your business. Instead, take time to talk about things that interest the type of customer base you're trying to target. You could spend a lot of time researching how to get followers, but you'll see greater results if you spend that time connecting with potential customers.</p>

<p>
<strong>Costs of Using Facebook and Twitter for Business</strong></p>

<p>Once you've determined how to get followers and fans, you'll need to consider the cost of using Facebook and Twitter for your business. Both websites are free to use. However, you might have to hire an employee or an independent contractor who knows how to get followers on Twitter and fans on Facebook, because building profitable social networking profiles can be time-consuming.</p>

<p>If you don't want to hire an independent contractor or employee who has what it takes to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Social-Media-Marketing-For-Dummies-6-Month-Access-for-Windows-1-User/product_954941">get followers</a>, you should consider using an online software program to schedule your updates. This keeps from being glued to the computer all day. There are a variety of applications available online, and you shouldn't need to spend more than $10 per month to schedule all your Facebook posts and tweets, ensuring more fans on Facebook.</p>

<p>The more social networking websites grow, the more important these sites become to business owners. There isn't another advertising tool out there that connects you to billions of people on a daily basis without costing you money. The popularity of social networking websites has made it necessary for business owners to learn how to get followers and fans. If you take the time to learn how to implement social networking into your business plan, it won't take long for your profits to increase.</p>

<title>Hot Desking: Is this Business Practice Right for Your Company? </title>
<description>Hot desking is throwing the traditional office concept out of the cubicle's (figurative) window.</description>

<content>
<![CDATA[
<p>If you were born before 1985, your first office job was most likely at a desk in a cubicle. As you progressed through the company, your cubicle got bigger; you gained a bigger desk and perhaps even a window. Once you made it into management, you left the cubicle behind for an office with four actual walls and a door. That was how success was measuredthe person with the office had "made it." However, for many companies, that yardstick no longer applies.</p>

<p>
<strong>What is Hot Desking?</strong></p>

<p>Hot desking is throwing the traditional office concept out of the cubicle's (figurative) window. Instead of everyone having a dedicated workspace, the office is an open environment, and people are free to choose where they do their work. Proponents of this concept believe it leads to 
<a href="http://www.lifespanfitness.com/workplace-solutions/research.html">greater innovation</a> through collaboration. Its detractors believe the opposite, claiming that the concept can stifle workers.</p>

<p>
<strong>Is Hot Desking the Right Idea for Your Company?</strong></p>

<p>A company that uses this approach can complete more work in less space, so from a business practice's financial standpoint, it's a good idea. However, the setup might not be for everyone or every industry. How do you know if 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Computer-Accessories/cat_CG1086">hot desking</a> is right for your company? Here are some things to consider:</p>

<ul>

<li>Confidentiality issues: If you work in an industry where business practices should not be shared office-wide, then you will either have to find a dedicated area for that portion of your business or install "pink noise," a barely audible low hum that helps drown out surrounding noise and muffles sounds from those working in that area.</li>

<li>Employee age: Younger workers typically are more open to the idea of hot desking, because they have lived in the wireless world of smartphones and laptops for much of their lives. Older employees, however, can be more set in their ways 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Commercial-Office-Furniture/cat_CL158902">office practices</a> and often prefer a permanent place for their plants and coffee mug. The idea of toting office materials through an office while looking for a place to work might be less appealing and could substantially lower their productivity.</li>

<li>Collaboration or independence-based environment: If your company depends on collaboration to be competitive and successful, this could be a viable option. However, if your company's workers basically work independently of each other, the shared space could be a distraction.</li>

<li>Location: Although hot desking takes up less space, the space itself has to be open and inviting. Many offices that implement hot desking use lounge chairs and contemporary design furniture, requiring enough space to support the office design. Cubicles might well be boring, but they are an efficient use of spacethat's why they are fixtures in office environments.</li>

<li>Special equipment and wiring: If you are converting your current traditional office space into a hot desking environment, you might have to do some upgrades. Workspaces will need docking stations for laptops, and you will need ample outlets for keeping cell phones and tablets charged. You will also need office equipment such as lockers or secure cubbies, as well as crates or carts, so employees can safely store and transport office supplies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hot desking has its supporters and critics, but if you want to create an open environment for your employees, this could be a good office practice for you. If it doesn't work out, you can always take the cubicles out of storage and go back to the traditional office design.</p>

<title>Healthy Vending Machines Create Happy Employees</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Vending machines are a fixture in many workplaces, providing convenient access to snacks and beverages that stave off hunger and thirst throughout the day. However, many of the snacks offered can be unhealthy due to high salt and fat contents. Fresh vending machines offer a healthy alternative, offering low-calorie snacks that are low in salt and fat, along with low-calorie beverages and water choices that fit well with a healthier lifestyle.</p>

<p>
<strong>A Healthy Worker is a Happy Worker</strong></p>

<p>Healthy workers often make for happy employees who are more productive over the long term. Their greater productivity makes them more valuable to their organization than employees with lower energy levels.</p>

<p>There are several methods available to an employer to foster improved employee health. The company could offer free health screenings, complementary therapies, health education, or professional health advice. The results can be a reduction in sick leave, lowered medical insurance costs, lower turnover, and increased productivity. However, all of these options come at a price that many smaller businesses may not be able to afford.</p>

<p>Providing healthy snacks through 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Healthy-Snacks/cat_CL163191">healthy vending machines</a> can be done at little or no cost to the company itself.</p>

<p>
<strong>Fresh Vending Machines</strong></p>

<p>Fresh vending machines are no different in terms of setup and operation from their traditional counterparts. Most vending companies offer fresh vending machine options regularly, providing healthier snacks as an alternative to the usual chips and candy bars.</p>

<p>Switching to a fresh vending machine is an easy process. An employer only has to contact the existing vending machine contractor and ask for healthier alternatives. When the vendor next visits the office, the unhealthy snacks can be switched out for healthier alternatives such as fruit bars, rice cakes and nuts. Vendors often offer healthier beverages in their 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Water-Juices/cat_CL141077">fresh vending machines</a> as well, swapping out sodas for healthier juices and bottled waters.</p>

<p>However, not all vendors have a fresh vending machine option. For those employers who cannot get the healthy snacks from their current vendor, specialty vendors are available. Employers should keep in mind that not all employees may wish to avoid high-calorie snacks. There's no need to change over entirely to healthy vending machines in the workplace. Most vendors will offer a variety of snacks with healthy options included to handle the wide range of employee tastes.</p>

<p>
<strong>Encouraging Healthy Eating</strong></p>

<p>Healthy workers are a boon for any business. Not only are they more productive, but they're also less costly to insure. Installing fresh vending machine options in the workplace is an inexpensive way to encourage healthier eating. This healthier eating also might extend outside the workplace, resulting in happy employees who continue to be more productive and capable.</p>

<p>If you are a business owner and you haven't taken a serious look at how social media marketing tools can help grow your business, you should add that to your business plan for the year. The incorporation of social media marketing tools is one of the biggest growth trends for 2013, going hand in hand with the use of mobile technology.</p>

<p>
<strong>Social Media Is Not Just a Game</strong></p>

<p>Statistics regarding 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Social-Media-Marketing-For-Dummies-30-Day-Access-for-Windows-1-User/product_954940">social media trends</a> show huge growth for 2013. Companies can no longer ignore this type of marketing. With the proliferation of mobile technology, many 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/tablets/directory_tablets">social media marketing tools</a> are designed for phones and tablets. Searching, browsing, and buying can all be done from mobile devices, and a smart business owner needs to decide how to take advantage of these trends for 2013.</p>

<p>Several social media marketing tools are free to use and can drive sales to your small business. The most well-known tool is Facebook, which allows companies to create business pages. Facebook has a mobile app for pages, so you can add text and pictures to your business page right from your phone. Customers can like your page and follow you to see what your business is up to from moment to moment.</p>

<p>
<strong>Mobile Technology in Business</strong></p>

<p>These days, small business owners see regular customers coming into their business and using both phones and tablets to take notes, keep contact lists, and search for products. This means you need to research how social media marketing tools can help you leverage your business via this new technology. Sometimes it is worth your while to investigate creating your own app for your company, but most often, you can use existing social media trends to your advantage.</p>

<p>Companies such as Yelp offer apps that allow you to list your business for free, allowing customers to leave reviews or locate special offers. Pinterest and Instagram allow you to post images featuring products, services or your staff and allow your customers to comment on (or simply "like") your updates.</p>

<p>
<strong>Cost of Social Media Marketing</strong></p>

<p>One of the best things about social media marketing is that it is inexpensive. If you are just starting out with this trend, you can dip your toe in without paying any money. You will have to invest time, and possibly staff labor hours, but what takes the longest is learning the ropes of marketing with social media marketing tools. However, it is not rocket science, and it can be a lot of fun. It's a great way to keep up with market trends and what's on your customers' minds.</p>

<p>The forecast for 2013 is a continued upswing in social media marketing, the use of mobile technology, and more ways to interact with customers. As a smart business owner, you can learn to use social media marketing tools to your advantage to expand your business to new customers and cement your relationship with your older customers.</p>

<title>Eyes on the Prize: 2013 Business Trends to Watch</title>
<description>In our ever-changing world, it is important for you to keep abreast of 2013 business trends.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>In our ever-changing world, it is extremely important for you as a business owner to keep abreast of 2013 business trends that will affect your bottom line. When you are planning business milestones to reach in 2013, look for ways to include changes in the way you do business that will benefit both you and your customers.</p>

<p>
<strong>Filtering Overwhelming Content</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest 2013 business trends is the filtering of the massive amount of content that is available to individuals on a daily basis. Many people receive information from phones, computers, tablets, television and radio, not to mention online chat and texting.</p>

<p>As a smart business owner, you need to pay attention to where your company's content falls in this spectrum. For instance, consider Google's new personalized search. Each person gets different search results based on that individual's search history. This affects how people find you online. Because your customers are critical to the success of your small business in 2013, you need to make sure you connect with them.</p>

<p>
<strong>Year of the Tablet</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/tablets/directory_tablets">2013 business trends</a> to pay attention to is the growth of mobile technology. If you are not technically savvy, you may not realize that mobile technology includes not just mobile phones, but also tablets. Customers are buying tablets in droves, and they are using them to search, browse, and buy products.</p>

<p>It is time for you to make sure your company is ready for this 2013 business trend, because it will make a difference in how your customers perceive you and how much they buy from you. The most obvious way to increase sales generated from tablets is to be sure your Web site is optimized for tablet viewing. Customers often find tablets easy to use because they have touchscreens and are far more lightweight than laptops.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Doing Business</strong></p>

<p>Keeping up with 2013 business trends does have a cost. At the very least, you may have to invest some of your time learning about the new technology by buying your own tablet and seeing how your Web site operates from it. Depending on how old your current Web site technology is, you may find yourself paying as much as you did for your original Web site if you decide that you want a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/winning-the-next-wave-of-the-internet-mobile.html">full-scale mobile site</a>. However, you may find that with a few minor tweaks, you will be up to date.</p>

<p>When it comes to figuring out how customers find you and how search and other content technology can build on that connection, the biggest expenditure is time, unless you hire a professional firm to look into it for you.</p>

<p>There is no question that 2013 business trends are focused on information. As a business owner, you need to create business milestones that apply those ideas to how your customers connect with you and use them to your advantage to strengthen your personal connection with both new and existing customers.</p>

<title>Varying Rates: Taxes on Investments &amp; Capital Gains </title>
<description>If you have investment assets, you need to understand how the capital gains tax works.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>If you have investment assets, you need to understand how the capital gains tax works. Not all investments trigger the capital gains tax, which is frequently lower than an individual's income tax rate. Depending on the types of investment vehicles you own and how they are structured, as well as factors like the economy and whether you bought or sold investments during the year, your tax bill could increase or decrease after factoring in investment income.</p>

<p>
<strong>Short-Term and Long-Term Capital Gains</strong></p>

<p>Capital gains and capital losses occur when qualifying investments are sold for a profit or a loss. The capital gains tax rate tops out at 20 percent, which represents an increase over the prior rate, 15 percent. This tax is most commonly used for stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. However, not all income from these sources triggers a capital gains tax (CGT)  some types of income, like interest and dividends, are taxed in the same way as ordinary income. Short-term CGTs apply to investments owned for less than twelve months; investments held longer than twelve months trigger long-term CGTs. Short-term CGTs are equal to your income tax rate. If you lose money on a long-term investment sale, you can deduct money from the CGT you owe on other investments that year, up to a certain amount.</p>

<p>Capital losses can be carried over from one year to the next, which means if you take a large loss one year, you may be able to reduce your tax liability in the future, assuming you later receive a profit on an eligible investment. You can also offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year with a capital gains loss.</p>

<p>Mutual funds can trigger CGTs, too. Anytime your mutual fund's manager makes a trade that results in a profit or a loss, CGTs come into play. Mutual funds are obligated to issue 1099 forms listing profits and losses to investors each January. If you sell your holdings in a mutual fund, that will also be a taxable event. The amount of tax you will pay depends on how long you held shares in the mutual fund. Because of the complexity of CGTs, you may wish to use
<a href="http://www.staples.com/tax+program/directory_tax+program"> tax filing software </a> to help you organize your 1099s and sales records.</p>

<p>
<strong>Taxation of Dividends and Interest</strong></p>

<p>Dividends are paid by stocks and sometimes mutual funds. Whether or not a dividend is paid depends on the performance of the investment, the fund's rules, and other factors. Dividends are taxed as ordinary income, not capital gains. By definition, dividends cannot be losses. If you own bonds, you may receive interest. Interest from bonds is taxed in the same manner as income. Of course, sales of bonds can still trigger CGTs if held for more than a year.</p>

<p>
<strong>Muni Bonds, the AMT, and Other Considerations</strong></p>

<p>Some bond interest does not generate an income tax liability, such as interest paid by municipal bonds. It may seem like the answer to low tax liability is a portfolio full of municipal bonds and long-term investments, but that is not necessarily true. In these circumstances, the alternative minimum tax (AMT) may be triggered, resulting in an even higher tax rate. For this reason, any investment portfolio should be carefully planned and maintained. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/financial+planning+software/directory_financial+planning+software"> Financial planning software </a> can make it easier.</p>

<p>Understanding the different tax rates that your investments may trigger is an important step for your annual tax preparation.</p>

<title>The Ins &amp; Outs of Small Business Tax Deductions</title>
<description>This financial tool allows you to reduce your tax liability, meaning that you will have to pay less to the IRS.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Tax deductions are an important part of preparing your state and federal tax return. This financial tool allows you to reduce your tax liability, meaning that you will have to pay less to the IRS. Tax deductions may help you receive an IRS refund, as well. Small business owners have tax deductions available to them beyond those available to individuals.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tax Deductions versus Tax Credits</strong></p>

<p>When you are working on your tax return, you must add up all of the income you have received from all sources. From that figure, you can take deductions. The amount after deductions determines your tax rate and final tax bill. It is common to confuse tax deductions with tax credits. A tax credit is applied to your tax bill  it reduces your owed taxes. A tax deduction reduces your taxable income. If you have a tax credit and a deduction for the same amount, the tax credit will reduce your bill much more than the deduction.</p>

<p>
<strong>Should You Itemize Your Deductions?</strong></p>

<p>When you file your taxes, you must choose between taking the standard deduction and itemizing your deductions. A standard deduction requires much less paperwork  it is set by the IRS each year, and you are entitled to it. If you itemize your deductions, you must list each item you want to deduct. This means you will need to have clear records, and it takes time. However, most small business owners have a smaller tax bill when they itemize their deductions than when they take the standard deduction. If you are not sure which option is best for you, consider using 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/tax+software/directory_tax+software">tax software</a> to help you compare easily and automatically.</p>

<p>
<strong>Common Tax Deductions for the Small Business Owner</strong></p>

<p>Small business owners can take deductions for office expenses, insurance costs, and motor vehicle usage, to name a few. Office expenses can be deducted whether you work from home or lease office space, but it can be more complicated to deduct a home office. Nonetheless, this important deduction can represent a significant tax savings and is worth considering. If you lease an office, you can easily calculate how much you have spent on rent, utilities, and incidental expenses over the course of the year. If you are going to claim the home office deduction, be sure that the space you are claiming is used only for your business and nothing else. If you use only part of a room for your home office, you can measure the space and use that square footage for your calculations. Equipment you are claiming as part of your home office deduction must also be used only for your business. If you pay for health insurance, your premiums are completely deductible up to your business' net profit. You can only deduct premium costs if you were not eligible for other insurance coverage. If you drive a car as part of your business, you can deduct a set amount for each mile you drove during the year. Additional costs like tolls and parking can also be deducted.</p>

<p>Though the sheer number of tax deductions available to you as a small business owner can make tax season seem overwhelming, there are resources that can help. Easy-to-use 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/tax+forms/directory_tax+forms"> tax forms</a> can help you stay organized when you file.</p>

<title>How to do Your Taxes: A Business Owner's Guide</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Filing your tax return is an important annual responsibility. Though all individuals in the United States must file a state and a federal tax return if they received income, small business owners can have more challenging tax filing responsibilities than others.</p>

<p>
<strong>Why Pay Taxes?</strong></p>

<p>The obvious answer is that it is the law. Even accidental oversights in your tax filings can result in fines. Intentional failure to pay taxes is a criminal matter, and civil and legal penalties can be very stiff for repeat offenders. The IRS has a broad range of tools at its disposal to enforce tax rules, including the ability to levy, or forcefully remove, money from your bank account. Therefore, it is advisable to be proactive about understanding your tax responsibilities.</p>

<p>
<strong>Filing on Time</strong></p>

<p>It is important to file your tax returns, forms, and fees on time. When a document or payment to the IRS is late, you could be charged a fine. Sometimes extensions can be worked out for tax return due dates, but the extension should be requested before the due date if possible. If you must make a payment to the IRS, whether because of income tax liability, payroll tax, or taxes due from previous years, it may be possible to work out a payment plan. If you do this, be sure to it. Payroll taxes usually must be paid throughout the year, while income and capital gains taxes are usually paid annually. If you need help keeping track of IRS due dates, use a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/calendar/directory_calendar"> calendar</a> to keep track of them.</p>

<p>
<strong>Understanding the Tax Calendar</strong></p>

<p>The most active period in the tax calendar is between January and April. During this period, many due dates for income earned and payments made during the previous year occur. For example, by January 31, you must give 1098, 1099, W-2G, and W-2 forms to employees, contractors, and others to whom you made payments during the prior year. It is important to send these forms on time, as the individuals you send forms to will need them to file their tax returns.</p>

<p>
<strong>Industry-Specific Tax Requirements</strong></p>

<p>Depending on your business type, you may have unique tax forms to file. For example, farmers and fisherman must use Form 1040-ES to pay their estimated taxes for the previous year by January 15. Large food and beverage establishments must file Form 8027 by February 28. By March 15, corporations must file Form 1120 for the calendar year, and a payment for taxes due must be included with that form. Alternatively, an estimated tax payment can be made and an extension requested. April 15 is the tax return due date for individuals, including small business owners, who must file Forms 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ. Form 4868 can be filed to request an extension, though estimated taxes must be paid on time. Some taxes, like payroll taxes, have multiple due dates throughout the year. If you need help filling out forms, choose 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/taxes/directory_taxes"> tax software</a> to make filing simpler. Though the number of forms, due dates, and information about your annual tax return can be complex and seem overwhelming, by keeping precise records and asking questions when you are unsure, you can file each year with confidence.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>As once said by the famous Virgil, They succeed, because they think they can. </strong>
<strong>Much like this quote is the passion of Tracy Belben, an upcoming designer who is </strong>
<strong>making her mark in the small business arena. Read below to learn Tracy's tips for </strong>
<strong>starting a small business.</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What was your inspiration for opening your business?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: The freedom of being able to express myself and share my work with others. I started the business between architecture jobs, during the recession of 20092010. I've always enjoyed fashion and shopping, and didn't have the budget to buy new clothing and accessories as I had been able to before the days of unemployment. In an attempt to keep up the lifestyle, I started creating my own accessories to jazz up existing outfits, eventually realizing the attention from friends within the fashion industry. Your work its so bold, edgy, and whats the word? RACY!- One friend said. From that point onward, T*Racy was born.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What was your ultimate goal when you decided to open your business, and has the goal changed?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: The ultimate goal, at the beginning, was to express myself and generate some income to survive the recession between jobs. Eventually, the goal shifted towards designing a line, one that allows the customer to express themselves and generate a long-lasting brand. With this I also hoped to be recognized by a savvy, fashion-conscience demographic.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: Does your business have an ecommerce site?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Yes, currently Im using Etsy.com and use the Square iPhone app (square.com). The app allows me to process orders when Im selling at trunk shows or for special orders through phone or email. Currently, I am collaborating with award-winning fashion designer Daniel Hernandez for a special collection that will be available exclusively through DH Studios, Inc.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What advertising methods do you use?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Personally, I love Twitter, Facebook and Pinterest (I just started using it) as a way to connect with followers, and advertise events where I will be selling product or to announce new products that have been added to my website. Best part about using social media for advertising its free! When I receive orders from individual customers, online or at a show, I include a free bumper sticker or magnet of a large T*Racy lips logo. This reminds people of my brand, wherever they are. I also carry business cards everywhere I go.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What advertising methods do you find most effective?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: This may come as a surprise, but business cards are the most effective. Face time with customers, potential collaborators, and press contacts are crucial. A well-designed, high-quality business card, in combination with a handshake, smile, and eye contact, grows a business and leads to sales.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: How important is it to recognize loyal customers?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Extremely important! Loyal customers are the people advocating your brand, by wearing the product and talking about it. Treat them well, appreciate them, and they will naturally sell for you because they love the product.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What percentages of your customers come from your local community?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Currently, about 65%75%, since I participate in local fashion and trunk shows. The remaining customers are from all over the world.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What sort of work do you do for the business outside business hours?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: I am constantly networking within the fashion community in and around New England. Websites like Meetup.com are great resources to meet people within your industry. I also attend other designers events to network, learn, and become inspired. Even if Im on vacation, I hand out business cards. Its a 24-hour business.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: Do you do this work from home?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Yes and no. The design and production work is prepared at my home studio, but the e-commerce and social media aspect of my business is conducted while Im on the go, by iPhone or laptop. I can work anywhere.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: Is running your business harder than you thought it would be?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Absolutely. I knew it would be hard, but didn't realize how much there is to learn, especially when it's not your background. You learn by doing, and "doing" is a challenge. It's intimidating starting a business! Making the leap and trusting yourself is the hardest part. Finding a support system, mentors, and partners is crucial to grow a brand.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: How long will you stay in this business for?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: As long as I can. The beauty of being trained as a designer is the ability to come up with new ideas. If something isn't working, you think of another creative option and test it. Over and over again...</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What sort of training did you have before going into business?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: I went through Architecture school. It taught me how to think by brainstorming concepts, presenting my work, and transforming an idea into reality.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What advice would you give someone who wants to set up their own business?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: If you have a great idea and strongly believe in it, dont let anything (including yourself) hold you back! Life is too short for coulda/woulda/shoulda excuses.</p>

<p>If the datas to be believed, Americans still love using the word password for their passwords. Unbelievable, right? Well, sadly, its true. Password is indeed the most common password used by Americans, according to a 
<a href="http://www.staysafeonline.org/about-us/news/national-cyber-security-alliance-announces-theme-for-data-privacy-day-and-forms-new-advisory-committee">number</a> of 
<a title="Splashdata worst passwords 2012" href="http://splashdata.com/press/PR121023.htm" target="_blank">studies</a> conducted at the end of 2012.</p>

<p>Whats even more shocking than the use of password is the fact that, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-most-unsafe-password-choices-of-2011.html" target="_blank">for several years in a row now</a>, this word has been used by countless Americans to safeguard their PCs even as major, heavily reported hacking events have affected well-known brands.</p>

<p>For example, in 2012 LinkedIn and Yahoo were both victims of large-scale security failures that saw hundreds of thousands of user passwords stolen by malicious hackers. (A quick note on that: if you were a user of those two sites in 2012 and havent changed your password in a long time, change it now!)</p>

<p>And yet, even with all of this information at hand, the following list of the most commonly used online passwords persists, year-after-year:</p>

<ol>

<li>password</li>

<li>123456</li>

<li>12345678</li>

<li>abc123</li>

<li>qwerty</li>

<li>monkey</li>

<li>letmein</li>

<li>dragon</li>

<li>111111</li>

<li>baseball</li>
</ol>

<p>At least Americas pastime (baseball) and an adorable primate got into the mix this year.</p>

<p>
<strong>Computer Password Tips</strong></p>

<p>As weve described in our articles on 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-most-unsafe-password-choices-of-2011.html" target="_blank">computer password selection</a> and protection, using simple words as a password makes it easy for a malicious hacker to access your data and steal your valuable information.</p>

<p>Instead, follow some of the tips below to strengthen your passwords. While no password will ever be 100 percent effective, a stronger password is often all youll need to motivate a hacker into moving onto easier prey.</p>

<ol>

<li>Make sure your password is at least 8 characters long.</li>

<li>Try a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.</li>

<li>Include symbols and numbers.</li>

<li>Do not use names, simple words, birthdates, phone numbers or anything else that a computer program could easily decipher using any number of readily available dictionary and phonebook programs.</li>

<li>For each web site where you have an account, use a different password. This is an admittedly cumbersome approach, but you can make things easier on yourself by using a password management system.</li>
</ol>

<title>Using Hand Sanitizers for Flu Prevention in the Workplace</title>
<description>Keep the flu away from your workers and your business.</description>

<p>Hand washing has long been touted as one of the best ways to top the spread of the influenza virus, and it is. However, a restroom or other hand washing station is not always readily available. By providing your employees with easy access to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, you can keep the flu from hitting your company and keep your business on track.</p>

<p>
<strong>How Hand Sanitizer Can Prevent the Flu</strong></p>

<p>Using alcohol-based 
<a title="hand sanitizers" href="http://www.staples.com/Hand-Soaps-Sanitizers-Lotions/cat_CL141836">hand sanitizers</a> is another step in the good daily hygiene habits and preventative measures your workers are already taking to keep from contracting influenza. These products work by eliminating most of the germs that exist on the hands. Every time you, or one of your employees, touch a surface that is infected with germs and then touch the face, eyes, nose, or mouth, you are taking the chance of introducing those germs into your body. The alcohol in hand sanitizers quickly kills most germs, making it an efficient method to quickly disinfect until a more thorough hand washing can be done.</p>

<p>
<strong>How to Choose a Hand Sanitizer</strong></p>

<p>Hand sanitizers come in a variety of formulas and forms. Some are scented, others are not. There is the traditional gel-like option, or you can choose from alcohol-based hand sanitizing foams and wipes. You may also want to provide a simple fragrance-free moisturizing 
<a title="lotion" href="http://www.staples.com/Hand-Soaps-Dispensers/cat_CL164888">lotion</a> for your employees, as alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be drying.</p>

<p>
<strong>Steps for Maximizing the Effectiveness of Hand Sanitizer</strong></p>

<p>To get the most out of your hand sanitizer, it is important to educate your employees on its proper technique and use:</p>

<p> Always make sure hands are not visibly soiled. If your hands are very dirty, the hand sanitizer will not be able to penetrate through and kill the germs on the hands. In this case, a thorough hand washing is probably the best option.</p>

<p> Make sure to use enough product. This is not a less-is-more situation. You want to make sure that you use enough to hand sanitizer to thoroughly coat all parts of the hands.</p>

<p> Keep rubbing the product in until the hands are completely dry. This helps make sure that the product comes into contact with all of the surfaces of the hands. Dont forget the backs of the hands and the fingers, as these areas are often more neglected than the palms.</p>

<p>By providing your workers with hand sanitizers as a quick and easy alternative to traditional hand washing, you can keep your employees healthy and minimize the effect of a flu outbreak in your business. Make sure to keep whatever alcohol-based hand sanitizer you choose out in the open where it is easily seen as a visual reminder to employees to use throughout the day. Using hand sanitizer in combination with preventative measures such as avoiding those sick with the flu and good hygiene practice can help keep you and your workers healthy through even the worst of flu season.</p>

<p>A flu outbreak in your workforce can cause problems in several different areas of your business. The best flu prevention is encouraging and educating workers on how to be proactive at fending off the flu virus. By making sure your employees do the best they can to stay in good health and flu free, you can keep your business running smoothly and efficiently.</p>

<p>
<strong>Ways to Avoid Germs</strong></p>

<p>One of the best methods of flu prevention is to keep the passing of germs to a minimum. While it is impossible to keep an entirely sterile environment, there are several ways to avoid catching the flu virus:</p>

<p> Stay away from people who are, or appear to be, sick. Encourage your employees to be alert for those that look like they may be infected with the flu, both at work and in their personal lives.</p>

<p> Steer clear of crowds and high-traffic areas. The more people there are, the higher the chances are that someone is carrying flu germs. Workers can decrease their odds of catching the flu by timing their errands and shopping at off-peak times whenever possible and doing their bests to stay out of particularly germy areas, such as hospitals and schools.</p>

<p>It is also important for those that do end up getting the flu to make sure they stay home to keep from infecting others. You can help your employees do this by encouraging them to stay alert for any signs of the flu and err on the side of caution to keep from potentially spreading their germs to the rest of the workforce. Some experts recommend employees with the flu stay home for between 5-7 days. Encouraging telecommuting when feasible may reduce employee downtime and prevent further spread of the illness.</p>

<p>
<strong>How Proper Hygiene Can Help Keep You Healthy</strong></p>

<p>While staying away from crowds and sick people is an important aspect of flu prevention, it is impossible for your employees to be out of contact with everyone. Encouraging proper hygiene, both at work and at home, can help kill any flu germs floating around. There are three easy practices that can go a long way in flu prevention:</p>

<p> Encourage employees to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing. This can help stop germs, flu or otherwise, from spreading. You can make this practice even easier for your workers by keeping several boxes of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Facial-Tissue/cat_CL141828">facial tissues</a> within easy reach of employee areas.</p>

<p>Make handwashing a top priority. Washing your hands is one of the single best methods of flu prevention, killing most flu virus germs that you come into contact with, and making this a company-wide practice will help keep your workforce healthy. Posting signs reminding employees to wash their hands before leaving the restroom and providing 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Hand-Soaps-Sanitizers-Lotions/cat_CL141836">hand sanitizer</a> are great ways to stay proactive.</p>

<p>
<strong>Other Ways to Keep the Flu at Bay</strong></p>

<p>In addition to avoiding and stopping the spread of germs, it is also important for employees to keep themselves as healthy as possible, making it easier for their bodies to fend off the flu virus. Encourage your staff to stay active and get plenty of rest during flu season. Providing healthy snack options and bottled water can also help make sure that your workers are refueling during the work day.</p>

<p>By encouraging your employees to adopt these healthy habits, you can avoid the troubles, such as unexpected understaffing, that can come from a flu outbreak among your workers. Flu prevention is key to keeping everyone healthy and productive year-round.</p>

<title>Tips from a VC: The Top Small Business Mistakes (part 5)</title>

<p>It takes a lot to become a successful small business entrepreneur. That great idea is just the beginning. You need a plan. You need a reliable team. You may need financing beyond what family and friends and your own hard work can provide. We were lucky enough to get some face time with Bob Davis, who founded and was CEO of Lycos and is now a leading venture capitalist with Highland Capital Partners. From his office in Cambridge, Mass., Davis tackled five major areas of small business investment.</p>

<p>In part five, Bob concludes his interview with a few no-fly zones to be aware of when you start to investigate funding options.</p>

<p>You can follow Bob on Twitter on 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/BobDavisHCP">@BobDavisHCP</a> or learn more about him at 
<a href="http://www.hcp.com/">www.hcp.com</a></p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: What are some of the mistakes that you see small business owners make most often?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong> The biggest is marching ahead, raising capital and extending effort prior to doing the hard work to verify your idea for a company has legs.  Some entrepreneurs dont research the competition, so they come in with an idea and they dont understand who else is doing something similar to it or how theyre going to compete with it, or even how well those competing products or services are financed.</p>

<p>Another seemingly obvious mistake that we see is an entrepreneur who 
<strong>hasnt talked to any prospective customers.</strong> They'll say to us, I have a great idea, but I dont really know if someones going to buy this or I dont know how its going to work or  I dont know what theyre going pay for it.</p>

<p>Some entrepreneurs have not thought through
<strong> a repeatable customer acquisition strategy</strong>. It's not enough to put your heart and soul into a product, have that first sale and then be done with it. This has to happen over and over, and over again in an affordable way. It's easier said than done.</p>

<p>Lastly, some entrepreneurs fail to develop a complete vision of the company they are building
<strong>.</strong> They don't understand, soup to nuts, how the business will evolve over time. When they are doing their work, they seek only confirming evidence of their idea. They talk to five people that say Its great!, I love it!, It's wonderful! But when someone happens to say, No I dont like this and the response always is, Well Im done with you, and they move on to someone who reinforces their beliefs.</p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: Any final advice?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong> If you have an itch to live an entrepreneurial life, there is no better time than the present. It is not easy but none of the great things in life are. Do your homework, develop a prepared mind, build your team and then jump in with all you have. There are few greater thrills in a business life than watching a dream turn into reality. Those that have the courage to follow a conviction can be an inspiration to us all.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Staying current with the latest software innovations is an important part of keeping your business relevant. Microsoft Office 2013 offers many of the best features of the traditional Office suite with a cloud-based storage system and enhanced functionality designed for touch devices.</p>

<p>
<strong>Understanding Microsoft Office 2013 Features</strong></p>

<p>With Microsoft Office 2013, you can take notes on your 
<a>tablet </a>and convert them to text easily from within the program. You can also navigate with easy and familiar touchscreen motions using Word and PowerPoint, and other programs. PowerPoint includes an easy-to-see timer that helps you keep presentations focused and to the point, and the revamped program also features compatibility with a digital stylus, so you can write directly on slides.</p>

<p>Use OneNote to organize your pictures, lists, web content and the notes you take with a 
<a>stylus</a>. You can also take photographs from your tablets camera and easily import them into OneNote. Microsoft Lync lets you manage your digital communications and use video, audio, messaging, and conferencing to stay in touch with colleagues and clients. Use a canvas accessible to all participants in a digital meeting to share PowerPoint presentations, documents, and other data so that you make the most out of each conference.</p>

<p>Microsoft Office 2013 relies on cloud data storage, so you can access your documents from any computer. When you sign in to Office, your personalized data profile will be available no matter where you are.</p>

<p>With Perceptive Pixel technology, you can use large interactive display screens to communicate your message to clients or lead an engaging meeting. Use a digital stylus or your hands to interact with the screen, move pictures, and make your data more engaging.</p>

<p>
<strong>Innovations of Office 2013 Compared to Older Versions</strong></p>

<p>The most prominent differences when comparing Office 2013 to other versions is the new focus on service versus product. In the tradition of other software-as-a-service business models, Microsoft Office 2013 will be available via three types of subscriptions. The latest versions touch capabilities and compatibility with tablet devices also sets it apart from earlier versions.</p>

<p>
<strong>Cost of Office 2013</strong></p>

<p>You can choose one of three Office versions; each has a different price structure and is designed for a different type of user. Office 365 Home Premium is designed for home use and comes with an extra 20GB of SkyDrive and an included 60 minutes per month of Skype. For small business owners, Office 365 Small Business Premium has tools for managing websites as well as web conferencing. Finally, Office 365 ProPlus is designed for corporate users and provides a wide range of business capabilities as well as enhanced cloud features. Corporate software versions tend to be more expensive than small business solutions, so youll have to weigh your companys needs against an increased price  especially if multiple licenses are required for your employees.</p>

<p>Microsoft Office 2013 offers the same full range of functions as its predecessors with an enhanced cloud and touchscreen capability. Adding it to your business software tools will help you keep pace with the competition.</p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: Let's say that maybe VC isnt right, and a business owner is just looking for that $50,000. What are your thoughts on micro-financing or crowd funding, like Kickstarter?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong> Crowd-funding is a great alternative, but in the case of entrepreneurs I would be more inclined to recommend knowledgeable investors. When youre taking money from people that have no relevance to your business, or who don't necessarily want to invest for the long-term, you're getting help with cash, which is OK, but as an entrepreneur, you want to associate yourself with not only investors, but also great advisors who can help guide your business in a meaningful way. If you take just a little bit of time when considering fund-raising options, and you're armed with a credible idea, you can always find relevant investors.</p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: It sounds like we'll continue to have discussions about accessibility versus relevance as these crowd-funding sites continue to grow in popularity.</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD: </strong>One of the common mistakes that entrepreneurs make is they pick these advisors or investors based on accessibility not relevance, and they know little about the investors on the other side of the table. It is very important to understand how to answer questions such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the investors objective?</p>

<p>How does the investor operate?</p>

<p>How does the investor work with me?</p>

<p>How will the investor help me?</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes people think of fundraising as an end not a mean. The fundraising should be the mean to something else, which is building a great businessnot the end unto itself.</p>

<title>The Importance of Branding to Your Hospitality Business</title>
<description>In the hospitality industry, brand recognition and customer loyalty is everything.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>In the competitive hospitality industry, setting your company apart is crucial to establishing a firm customer base. This is true of small, independently owned hotels as well as national chains. You can position your hotel, motel, or bed-and-breakfast for success when you brand everyday and luxury items so that customers remember you the next time they need to book a reservation. By making smart choices about item type, branding method, and monetary expenditures, you can find a branding strategy that makes your hospitality company memorable.</p>

<p>
<strong>Boosting Customer Loyalty with Branded Items</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of branding is to help ensure customers will return again, and even recommend your business to others. Traditional branding options include pillow mints, tea, and travel toiletries. You can also brand special items designed for your guests to enjoy long after they have left your property, such as luxury bath robes or gourmet jams and jellies. Some products can be complementary, while others can be sold in your property's gift shop.</p>

<p>Consider co-branding to set your hospitality business apart. Co-branding is when two separate companies form a partnership to enhance both of their brand images. For example, when a well-known bath products company co-branded with a major hotel chain, the bath company was able to boost its profile while the hotel offered its customers standard branded amenities with a luxury twist.</p>

<p>
<strong>Classic and Innovative Branding Choices</strong></p>

<p>Traditionally, hotels have branded items that customers already expect to find in their suites, such as 
<a>mints</a> on their pillows or in the bathroom. This is still a solid branding strategy, however, you should ensure the products you choose reflect your hotel's quality level and image -- remember, your company's name is on the wrapper.</p>

<p>If your hotel is in an area well-known for a certain type of good, consider branding quality, locally made samples of this item. For example, if your hotel is in California's wine country, look into partnering with a local vineyard. Use 
<a>copy and print services </a>to make labels for the wine bottles showcasing your partnership. Creative branding choices like this one will help customers remember you when they are booking vacations in the future.</p>

<p>
<strong>Cost vs. Benefit of Branded Gifts</strong></p>

<p>It's important to choose a hospitality branding strategy that fits with your company's budget. Fortunately, creative, clever, and cute branding choices don't have to cost a lot. Small conveniences like a branded beer bottle opener and a coupon for a local microbrewery go a long way to enhancing your brand's perceived value.</p>

<p>Consider branding choices that you don't give away  for example, if your onsite restaurant makes excellent sauces, consider bottling them. When your customers use the products at home, they will remember their stay with every use.</p>

<p>The point of branding in the hospitality industry is to enhance your customers perception of your value. Remember to choose branding strategies that reflect your propertys unique image. Luxury hotels should choose high-end branding options, while small bed-and-breakfasts should pick home-style or region-centric hotel amenities that reflect their charm.</p>

<p>It takes a lot to become a successful small business entrepreneur. That great idea is just the beginning. You need a plan. You need a reliable team. You may need financing beyond what family and friends and your own hard work can provide. We were lucky enough to get some face time with Bob Davis, who founded and was CEO of Lycos and is now a leading venture capitalist with Highland Capital Partners. From his office in Cambridge, Mass., Davis tackled five major areas of small business investment.</p>

<p>In part three, we focus on the special traits that any VC wants to see while considering the next big thing.</p>

<a href="http://www.twitter.com/BobDavisHCP">@BobDavisHCP</a> or learn more about him at 
<a href="http://www.hcp.com/">www.hcp.com</a></p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: When you begin to consider investing in a company, what are some of the things you look for?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong> Thats an easy question to answer. What I look for every time are People, Market and Product, in that order.</p>

<p>People, first and foremost; I look for great leaders and teams. Its rarely just one individual who gets a business going. I love teams of smart, intelligent, passionate, driven individuals who have demonstrated success in their pasts and are looking to do it again. And by that I dont necessarily mean theyve started a company in the past. We often back first time entrepreneurs, but whether the first time or the twentieth we always want to know about the individuals and their backgrounds. We want you to answer a lot of questions that help us understand you, questions such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell me your life story</p>

<p>What did you do in school that had an impact?</p>

<p>What type of leadership roles have you shown in the past?</p>

<p>How will your company change the world?</p>

<p>How is your thinking different?</p>

<p>How have you broken out in the past in terms of what you have done?</p></blockquote>

<p>There are no correct answers to these questions but they are a critically important part of the process as a VC and an entrepreneur set about understanding if they are going to be good partners for one another.</p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: Its interesting to note that those questions dont really touch upon the product or service these owners are looking to sell.</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD: </strong>Truthfully, its very often that an entrepreneur will come and visit us and want to start with Let me tell you all about my product, and we have to slow that down and say Great, and we want to hear about that, but before you get there, I want to know all about you. The reason being, I want to understand the individual. Whats behind them, why this product or service is important to them, and what their motivation for this idea might be. Thats the first conversation were going to have.</p>

<p>When that is complete, I want to hear about their 
<em>market</em>. Lets assume your idea is a good one, whatever it might be. Thats not going to matter if the market isnt big enough to support it. We're looking for growth, and want to believe that the market is big enough, that if we succeed, we have the chance to build a company of distinction. We like to see a marketplace where theres expansion and where an innovative, unique company could prosper. The adage that says a rising tide lifts all ships is so true in a business context.  Your odds of success are just so much greater if your market is expanding.</p>

<p>When it is time to finally look at the product itself, I say,</p>

<p>Now I know that you are a great person in a big, growing market, so tell me how you are going to go about tackling it. Tell me about your idea and your product and why you think you could build it. And then, if you do build it, why does that matter, why would someone want to care? What are the [pain] points that you are solving?</p>

<p>And if it is relevant and necessary, how do you get to market faster than a host of potential competitors that are hoping to eat your lunch?</p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: What are the traits that make you sit back and say, this is a great team and now I really want to hear about the product and the market theyre in?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong> Perseverance is incredibly important. The entrepreneurs journey is one that will always be riddled with failures and disappointments, whatever the company. The best companies in America can tell you horror stories of their growth in terms of where the company suffered, but to have the courage to pick yourself up and brush yourself off and say Im going ahead is what we look for.</p>

<p>Obviously we also look for intelligence, for smart people who are willing to do their research. Every entrepreneur should ask themselves more tough questions than an outsider could ever hope to think of.  Dont be cavalier but be comprehensive, thorough and detailed in your research. Pay close attention to the feedback the marketplace gives you with great, great attention to detail. It's infinitely easier to shut down an idea before it ever launches than after many years of hard work and money spent.  It's equally easier to launch a company, hire a team, and motivate yourself with the confidence that the idea is a winner and free of nagging doubts.</p>

<p>We look for a team builder because I havent seen a company yet, thats built on the success of only one individual. This is true with the stalwarts on American ingenuity and companies that have founders closely identified with the company itself.  Big success stories such as Apple and Microsoft required a full team effort. We look for a real team building leader in any investment we make</p>

<title>Tips from a VC: Identifying Small Business Investment Objectives (part 2)</title>
<description>Objectives every small business should consider when approaching investment opportunities.</description>

<p>It takes a lot to become a successful small business entrepreneur. That great idea is just the beginning. You need a plan. You need a reliable team. You may need financing beyond what family and friends and your own hard work can provide. We were lucky enough to get some face time with Bob Davis, who founded and was CEO of Lycos and is now a leading venture capitalist with Highland Capital Partners. From his office in Cambridge, Mass., Davis tackled five major areas of small business investment.</p>

<p>In part two, we'll take a look at the kinds of objectives you need to consider when approaching investment opportunities for your small business.</p>

<p>You can follow Bob on Twitter on 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/BobDavisHCP">@BobDavisHCP</a> or learn more about him at 
<a href="http://www.hcp.com/">www.hcp.com</a></p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: Are there specific objectives or traits a business should look for when researching VC funding?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong>  Its an interesting question. You dont necessarily need a venture capitalist that is learning on the job with you. You generally would want someone that has the experience to understand what youre building and how you are going to go about it. If an entrepreneur was starting a healthcare company, for medical devices, for example, I would tell the entrepreneur that my firm is not the match [since that is not our specialty].</p>

<p>Second of all, take a look at your personal assets and ask, Do I want to finance this myself? Look at potential outside sources of financing:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Friends and family</strong></li>

<li>Previously successful 
<strong>angel investors</strong>, which means someone who has a little extra cash around and is interested in contributing to a business without requiring a significant amount of ownership</li>

<li>
<strong>Structured seed funds</strong>, of which there are many, that invest in very early companies, generally with smaller amounts. These investments are generally anywhere from $50,000 to $500,000</li>

<li>
<strong>Incubators</strong> that provide a small amount of capital, but even more importantly, provide extensive mentoring and guidance.  Essentially, you go to school for a three to five month period and  have a team of people helping you learn how to build your business.</li>

<li>
<strong>Venture funds</strong>, which typically invest in Series A and beyond. In addition to capital, a venture fund typically holds a board seat and works with the entrepreneur at every stage of company building.  Some venture funds will invest very early as an idea is being germinated while others look for some level of momentum underneath the business before an investment is made.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Staples: Is there a situation or a stage of a companys growth where it doesnt makes sense to start investigating VC?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong> For the most part VC is when you need a substantial amount to accelerate the growth of the business and youre looking for an active investor, an active board member, and more importantly a partner for the growth of the company. Entrepreneurs should also note that, while it's not an absolute rule, most VCs are looking for a minimum of 20% ownership at the time they invest in a company.</p>

<a href="http://www.hcp.com/">www.hcp.com</a></p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: What key points should small business owners consider when they investigate outside investment?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong> The entrepreneur should understand they are setting up a long term and important partnership. A new investor means somebody else is going to own a piece of your business. Its rare that an investor, especially a venture capitalist, will ever just write a check and disappear.</p>

<p>Investors should be thought of as a helpful adjunct to the company organization. Theyll be an advisor, a mentor, and a partner. Theyll also be someone who helps with connections, with strategy, and with building your team.</p>

<p>They should also know that its a rare company that raises money and instantly sees some magical liquidity event. In most cases its a five- to ten-year relationship. Thats a long time and you want to be sure that in addition to everything weve already discussed, the chemistry is right.</p>

<p>When Im looking at a company, in addition to saying, This is a great entrepreneur and I like their business idea, I say Do I want to spend the next seven years of my life in the trenches with this CEO? Thats a key criterion, because the average time today for a company that is engaged with venture capital before they see an exit is nine years. Now, that number is a little misleading because the companies that fail, often fail very quickly and the companies that do really well often do very well quickly but the companies in the middle are riding it out for the long term.</p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: Do you feel most of the entrepreneurs who approach your firm understand that time investment?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong> No, but thats not necessarily a negative. Its hard to find an entrepreneur that doesnt think theyre going to be differentwhich is a good thing by the waythat they are going to be the next Facebook and that they are going to change the world overnight.</p>

<p>
<strong>Staples:</strong> 
<strong>You mentioned Facebook, and were curious to see how the next big thing mentality may have affected the candidates that approach you, for better or worse?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong> Ultimately, its been affected in a good way. Entrepreneurship is still about following the dream but the reality still is that the life of an entrepreneur is one of setbacks, challenges, failures, disappointments, missed birthday parties, missed anniversaries and travel in the back row of a plane. It is still really hard work and sacrifice. And ultimately, as an entrepreneur, when it all clicks, when it all works, there is really no greater reward as a business owner. I dont mean the financial reward. Of course thats nice, but what I mean is the sense that you work with pride and can say, I built that, that was me, this is what I did and this is a reflection of the success I had. As an owner or CEO, you can still look at the many hundreds of thousands of jobs youve created as part of your innovation. That's a pretty special feeling, its a pretty magical find, and it's still very much intact today.</p>

<p>
<strong>Staples: Even Apple started in a garage.</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>BD:</strong> Thats true with any company. Whoever they are - General Electric, Staples, Google. Whoever they are it started at one point with one person with the courage to follow a dream.</p>

<title>Survey says: Offices have a lot to learn about the flu</title>
<description>Have you cleaned your work desk lately?</description>
<link>http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/flu-articles/survey-says-offices-have-a-lot-to-learn-about-the-flu.html</link>

<![CDATA[
<p>Have you cleaned your work desk lately? Or ever? If the answer is no, youre not alone. Staples third annual 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/centers/flu-center/">flu season</a> survey found that more than half of office employees clean their desks less than once per week.</p>

<p>So, why should you add this easy task to your to-do list? Germs, including the flu virus, can live on surfaces for up to three days. And keyboards  that can trap whatever germs your hands have come into contact with around the office, not to mention food crumbs - are often one of the dirtiest items in personal workspaces.</p>

<p>According to the Staples survey, office workers make other avoidable mistakes that can fuel the spread of germs. And when it comes to flu knowledge, they dont have all the facts.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>The sick truth</strong></p>

<p>Twenty-five percent of those surveyed believe that doorknobs and door handles are the dirtiest surfaces in the entire office. While those items are definitely germ magnets, the breakroom sink actually takes the dirtiest title, followed by the community microwave. Only six percent of workers correctly guessed the sink, and only eight percent said the microwave.</p>

<p>Not only are many people unaware of where germs may be lurking in the office, theyre also responsible for bringing the flu into work with them.</p>

<p>A whopping 80% of workers admitted to going to work when they knew they were sick, up 20% from last years survey. And 65% think its only necessary to stay home from work with the flu for 1-3 days. Actually, the flu virus may be contagious for one day before symptoms develop, and 5-7 days after an individual becomes sick.</p>

<p>Why dont sick employees just stay home? The number one reason provided by nearly half of respondents was concern about completing their work. About a quarter of workers cited not wanting to use a sick day. In addition to possibly infecting others, ill employees may also negatively impact work quality and performance. A majority of those surveyed said their productivity level is only around 50% when theyre feeling sick.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>What your business can do</strong></p>

<p>In a typical year, the flu virus is responsible for approximately 70 million missed workdays and an estimated $10 billion in lost office productivity. Here are a few things you can do to keep employees, and your business, healthy.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Raise your offices flu IQ</strong></p>

<p>Three years of Staples surveys show that office workers are not fully informed when it comes to the flu. So educate your workers about how often to clean their desks, office areas that should be disinfected frequently, and the appropriate amount of time to stay home when theyre sick. And when you see unhealthy behaviors going on in the workplace, use it as an opportunity to spread more knowledge  and fewer germs.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Stock up on flu fighters</strong></p>

<p>In a separate Staples survey of office Facility Managers, 40% of respondents said their staff do clean individual employees workspaces. And more than half said they barely increase time spent cleaning during flu season. So make sure your office has all the essentials your workers need to keep both shared and personal areas clean and germ free.</p>

<p>Businesses of all sizes turn to Staples for products that keep sick days down and productivity up. At Staples, we know that companies are already doing more with fewer resources, and flu season has the potential to impact productivity, said Lisa Hamblet, Vice President of Facilities Solutions for Staples Advantage, the business-to-business division of Staples. Prevention is key, and using the right supplies is critical. Products such as hands-free soap, paper towel dispensers, disinfectants and sanitizers, along with staff awareness, can help keep an office healthy.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Consider working sick  from home</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, it would be best if employees stayed home and rested until they felt better and were no longer contagious. But according to Staples survey results, many are worried about not getting work done or using up sick days. So, businesses may want to consider offering a telecommuting option as a way to prevent sick employees from coming in to work. Of those respondents whose companies offer a telecommuting option, nearly half take advantage of it when sick to avoid spreading germs in the office.</p>

<p>Paying business taxes is always a painful exercise for small business owners. Such entrepreneurs have a perennial complaint that tax planning never helps reduce their tax liability significantly. Well, reducing your tax liability will require year-round tax planning. Focusing on your tax payments just a few weeks before the filing due date is never going to yield satisfactory results.</p>

<p>
<strong>How will Year-Round Planning Help?</strong></p>

<p>An average small business is normally eligible for around a dozen tax deductions. You can claim deductions on:</p>

<p> Purchasing office supplies, furniture, equipment, and software programs</p>

<p> Using a car for business purposes</p>

<p> Business-related travel and entertainment expenses</p>

<p> Telephone costs</p>

<p> Contributions toward insurance policies, retirement plans, and pension funds</p>

<p>Most small businesses never take full advantage of the first four deductions. Keeping track of these expenses requires systematic maintenance of records throughout the year. Not retaining proof of purchase and not determining the proportion of business costs in combined expenses can cause your business taxes to rise. Ideally, every single expense should be analyzed for its tax impact as soon as it is made. Unfortunately, tax planning is a once-a-year affair for most entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>
<strong>Technology - the Perfect Tool for Tax Planning</strong></p>

<p>Sorting and analyzing the tax implications of your expenses will be simple if you work with scanned copies of receipts and other documents. Use scanners with programs designed for such tasks. You can even transfer the images to your tablet for easy sorting and organization.</p>

<p>The IRS has fixed rules for determining the deductible components of rent and energy charges paid for a home office, as well as the running expenses of a car used for work and personal reasons. Feed the formula into a spreadsheet and use it as a template every time you pay rent or fill up on gas. Simply updating the file and retaining receipts will be enough to reduce your business taxes.</p>

<p>
<strong>Spend Money to Save Money</strong></p>

<p>Simply buying tax forms early will not bring down your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Accounting-Forms/cat_CG1283">business taxes</a>. You must obtain the adequate number of journals and books necessary for recording business and nonbusiness transactions. These journals and record books cost less than $30 while refill sheets cost less than $10.</p>

<p>You can skip old-fashioned manual recordkeeping by opting for the latest 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Financial-Accounting-Tax/cat_CL167738">online tax filing</a> software applications instead. Depending on the features you choose, these programs will cost around $140 to $1700. The initial phase will be tough, but regular use should help you record data and anticipate business taxes in advance. This will help you make advance payments throughout the year.</p>

<p>Its important to know when to seek professional tax planning advice. Pay for professional advice instead of arbitrarily interpreting gray areas in tax laws in your favor. This will ensure you do not unknowingly violate tax laws applicable to your small business.</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>A holistic approach combined with diligent recording and analysis of transactions and expenses will help negate the feeling that your business taxes are not under your control. Combine technology with disciplined paperwork to keep your taxes under control.</p>

<title>The World's Easiest Management Secret</title>
<description>Learn how to manage a business effectively.</description>

<p>Successful business management is a complex task for new owners, or those looking to turn a business around. To run effectively, businesses with a small staff or employee roster need the same management skills as a multinational corporation. Fortunately, the key to running a successful business is as simple as good management skills and smart hiring.</p>

<p>
<strong>Using Wisdom is Worker Acquisition</strong></p>

<p>Managers and owners who spend all of their time looking over an associates shoulder is often overlooking larger managerial issues. Smart hiring requires owners to look for the best people to help make the business work.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to find the best people to perform the jobs in and around the business. Applications and job announcements that request specific skills and experience are a way to advertise what you are looking for in the right candidate. It does not hurt to have these printed to your specifications. Plus, handouts and posters go well with Internet postings to get the word out. Seek a print center to assist you with this project or pair business printing software with human resource tools.</p>

<p>However you perform the search, be sure to weed out the less qualified applicants early on in order to save time during the hiring process. Only pay attention to the applicants who meet the posted requirements and to those who have submitted supporting documents as instructed. These are the applicants who deserve your attention during the interview process.</p>

<p>
<strong>Using Your Staff Wisely</strong></p>

<p>Once the staff is hired, you must trust them to perform the job given. Good managers with great management skills can delegate tasks to keep productivity high and 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Office-Productivity/cat_CL167739">business organization</a> its best. Delegation instills respect in your employees that will go a long way in keeping them productive.</p>

<p>Today's world of technological advances allows owners to keep in touch with staff.</p>

<ul>

<li>Integrated communications systems allow for videos and teleconferencing calls to catch managers up on day-to-day operations.</li>

<li>Online chat programs and internal email is another option for keeping management updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today's business owner doesn't have to be in the office every day. He or she can work on other parts of the business organization, like expansion and gathering investors away from the office, without being left in the dark about company operations.</p>

<p>
<strong>Letting the People Work</strong></p>

<p>When hiring associates and tasking them with assignments, you must be prepared to spend a little money to build the systems needed to properly manage the company. This means upgrading the telecommunications and computer hardware and software to ensure staff have easy open communication avenues. Some buildings may come equipped with the systems, and in others, they only need to be implemented. Others still are looking at four to five figures in upgrades, depending on their communications needs. Printing flyers and posting job announcements can be done for as little as $500 with business printing software.</p>

<p>The secret to good business management skills is hiring the right people to do each job well so that you, the owner, can focus on the broader aspects of maintaining the business. This requires a lot of patience, the acknowledgment of good management skills, and probably a change in the way you communicate with staff. It isn't impossible, especially with the right tools on hand.</p>

<title>Winning the Next Wave of the Internet: Mobile</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Desktops and laptops are no longer the most preferred devices for accessing the Internet. With mobile search queries on Google have risen by 3000 percent in the past three years, web access through mobile devices is set to become more popular in the next two or three years. More and more people are searching for new products, services, discounts, and offers on the Internet through their smartphones. Embracing this change can help your business flourish and grow faster.</p>

<p>
<strong>Advantages of Focusing on Mobile Internet</strong></p>

<p>Unlike desktop and laptop users, those accessing the Internet through their cell phones invariably focus on locally available products and services. M-commerce is highly localized. Setting up a mobile-centric website can help you target all those individuals who are searching for new products, deals, discounts, and special offers in their cities. Offering a fully functional mobile Internet website and mobile apps to customers is equivalent to having loudspeakers blaring information about your latest product and offerings on every major road in your city throughout the day.</p>

<p>
<strong>Mobile Internet vs. Old-fashioned Internet</strong></p>

<p>A mobile website, unlike a traditional website, is designed to provide maximum information to the user in the shortest possible time. Those using smartphones cannot be expected to sift through unnecessary information. A simple, functional, and utilitarian mobile website will deliver essential details of your product and services without delays or hassles. "Call Us" and "Find Us" links can help convert the web surfer into a potential customer in a span of a few minutes. The latter link can help those with GPS-enabled smartphones locate your business. Creating a cell-phones-only version of your existing website can help expand your web presence. Once you are certain of the advantages of targeting mobile web surfers, you can setup a standalone mobile website.</p>

<p>Your mobile website will help you implement hyper-local marketing strategies and campaigns. You can offer discounts on products and accessories related to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Mobile-Phones/cat_CL166921">cell phones</a> to the first hundred subscribers of your site's text messaging service. This type of marketing campaign will:</p>

<p> Spread the word about your mobile site</p>

<p> Please existing customers who own smartphones</p>

<p> Attract new customers</p>

<p> Create a positive buzz around your business</p>

<p>
<strong>Costs and Risks Associated with Mobile Internet</strong></p>

<p>A badly designed mobile website can severely affect the popularity of your business. In fact, surveys have shown that customers are less likely to recommend businesses with poorly designed websites for cellphones.</p>

<p>It is advisable to employ professional web designers when setting up a mobile website to target the m-commerce segment. There are also extra costs associated with set up and maintenance of a mobile site. Be aware that you will also have to spend time on devising and implementing search engine optimization strategies as well.</p>

<p>It is imperative to purchase antivirus and computer security applications for the website designed for 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Anti-Virus-Security-Privacy/cat_CL167734">smartphones</a> and cell phones. Giving hackers access to the mobile numbers of all your m-commerce customers can be devastating for your business.</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Despite associated risks, mobile Internet is too lucrative an opportunity to ignore. Very few small businesses have woken up to the advantages of focusing on m-commerce. Adopting a holistic approach towards mobile Internet and including those who use smartphones to surf the web in your web strategy will prove to be very beneficial for your small business.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Aside from when you first set it up, the most important time to file forms for your business is when taxes are due. The structure of your business will help determine which forms you need to file at tax time. Use this guide to get a general idea of the forms you may be responsible for and to get help with your tax preparation.</p>

<p>
<strong>Types of Business Taxes</strong></p>

<p>Small business owners may need to file 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/HR-Block-at-Home-Premium-Business-2012-State-eFile/product_990270">business tax</a> forms that include yearly income tax returns, estimated tax forms, and employment taxes. Employment taxes consist of the employer's portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes, income tax withholdings, and federal unemployment taxes. They may also need to pay excise taxes.</p>

<p>
<strong>Annual Income and Estimated Taxes</strong></p>

<p>C and S corporations should look at either Form 1120 U.S. Corporation Tax Return or Form 1120S U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation during tax preparation for an annual return and at Form 1120-W Estimated Tax for Corporations for estimated taxes. In addition, if you are a shareholder to an S corporation or part of a partnership, then you will also need to file a Schedule E Supplemental Income and Loss form with your Form 1040 and a 1040-ES with your personal estimated taxes. Those who are part of a partnership should file Form 1065 U.S. Return of Partnership Income for their annual return. Those involved in a partnership may also need to factor in self-employment taxes during their tax preparation.</p>

<p>
<strong>Business Taxes for Employers</strong></p>

<p>Businesses of all types need to include the same three forms in their tax preparation if they hire employees. These include Form 940 Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return, Form 941 Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, and Form 943 Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural Employees. In addition to these forms, employers also need to fill out a W-2 for each employee and send the form to the respective employee and the Social Security Administration. The same goes for Form 1099 if businesses hire independent contractors.</p>

<p>
<strong>Excise Taxes</strong></p>

<p>There are several excise tax forms that a business may need to include in its 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Accounting-Forms/cat_CG1283">tax preparation</a>. These include Forms 11-C Occupational Tax and Registration Return for Wagering, 720 Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return, 720-CS Carrier Summary Report, 720-T0 Terminal Operator Report, 730 Monthly Tax Return for Wagers, 1363 Export Exemption Certificate, 4136 Credit for Federal Tax Paid on Fuels, 6197 Gas Guzzler Tax, 6478 Credit for Alcohol Used as Fuel, 6627 Environmental Taxes, 8864 Biodiesel Fuels Credit, 2290 Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax Return, and 8849 Claim for Refund of Excise Tax.</p>

<p>
<strong>Limited-Liability Corporations</strong></p>

<p>You will need to include the same paperwork in your tax preparation as a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietor depending on what elections you make and how many members you have. You may need to file Form 8832 if you want to change your classification for business tax purposes.</p>

<p>One of the biggest things that catch new business owners by surprise during tax preparation is that they may be required to file estimated quarterly taxes. This helps keep payments lower but means you must deal with filing more than once a year. To keep from owing penalties due to surprises like this, make an appointment with a qualified CPA that knows about small business taxes.</p>

<title>Top Ten Questions You Need to Ask Your Accountant about Tax Time</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Filing taxes is a stressful event for most people, but it can be especially so for small business owners. If this is your first year running a business, then you will need to be aware of some questions that are specific to filing taxes for businesses. Here are ten of the most important tax prep questions for small business owners.</p>

<p>
<strong>1. What Information Do I Need to Keep?</strong></p>

<p>Your accountant will need certain paperwork and receipts to fill out your tax information and make sure that you receive all of the deductions you qualify for.</p>

<p>
<strong>2. What Direct Business Expenses Can I Deduct?</strong></p>

<p>Knowing how many of your expenses you can deduct will help you plan for filing taxes during the year. More often than not, you can deduct the money that your business directly spends on services, rental space, equipment, and other items. As long as there is no gray area, such as in the case of home businesses, an expense will usually qualify as deductible.</p>

<p>
<strong>3. Is There Anything I Should Do to Increase My Savings?</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, you will get a bigger deduction for buying certain items, such as an energy-efficient air conditioner-as opposed to a standard one-for your office. Knowing these answers will help you plan for 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/HR-Block-at-Home-Premium-Business-2012-State-eFile/product_990270">filing taxes</a> when you are deciding on a purchase.</p>

<p>
<strong>4. How Much of My Home Office Is Deductible?</strong></p>

<p>If you work from home, this will be an important question. You can deduct utility and mortgage or rent amounts that you spend on your home office, but there are certain guidelines you must follow. Your accountant will know the exact answers that pertain to your situation.</p>

<p>
<strong>5. How Much of My Car Is Deductible?</strong></p>

<p>If you have a car that use for business purposes, you may be able to deduct part of your payment, insurance, and maintenance costs at tax time. This is especially true if you use the car only for those purposes.</p>

<p>
<strong>6. How Much of My Household Bills and Equipment is Deductible?</strong></p>

<p>You may also be able to write off a portion of your household bills, such as Internet and phone. Also on the list could be your home computer, printer, and fax machine, depending on how much you use these items to run your home business.</p>

<p>
<strong>7. How Much of My Travel Expenses Are Deductible?</strong></p>

<p>While most business-related travel expenses are tax deductible, there may be exclusions or special rules if you brought your family along or turned it into a mini-vacation for yourself.</p>

<p>
<strong>8. What Are the Special Requirements for Business Deductions?</strong></p>

<p>If you plan to take deductions for a home office, a car, travel expenses, or household bills and equipment, then you will need to know the rules of doing so. For example, the portion of your home that you write off as your home office must be a space that you use exclusively for business purposes.</p>

<p>
<strong>9. Does the Legal Structure of My Business Matter When Filing Taxes?</strong></p>

<p>Maybe you are a sole proprietor looking to incorporate or trying to decide between LLC and S Corp; either way, you will want to know how your choice is going to affect you when filing taxes.</p>

<p>
<strong>10. Do My Employees Count as Independent Contractors or True Employees?</strong></p>

<p>This is a very important question because you have more responsibilities for a true employee, such as withholding income taxes and paying a portion of the employee's employment taxes. These are just some of the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Financial-Accounting-Tax/cat_CL167738">tax prep</a> questions you will need to ask your accountant. As the rules can change from year to year, it is important to sit down and chat with your CPA before tax time arrives so that you will be ready.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Small business owners often treat branding as something best ignored until their small business grows into a big company. Others equate brand building with getting a logo designed by an expensive designer. Today, you can include branding strategies in your marketing plan without spending a small fortune in the process.</p>

<p>
<strong>How Can Brand Building Help Your Small Business?</strong></p>

<p>A firm's brand is something more than its logo or trademark. Brand refers to a symbol that stands for your work culture, values, ethics, actions, and results. Developments over the past decade have made it easier for small businesses to build a brand and popularize it amongst the masses.</p>

<p>Creating a good logo is the simplest way to convey the values of your firm to your target audience in a simple and effective manner. Employ freelance designers, professional designing firms, or crowdsourcing firms online to create the perfect logo for your business marketing activities. You dont need to ignore branding just because you feel that you cannot afford to create an excellent logo.</p>

<p>Branding your business will be a success only if you popularize your brand amongst your target audience. Customers, potential clients, stakeholders, and competitors should identify what your business stands for when they see your brand logo and other company symbols. This is where online copy and print solutions can prove invaluable in 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/index.html">branding</a> your small business. By using affordable online services, you can highlight your logo on freebies, promotional material, letterheads, business cards, and festive gifts offered to customers and patrons.</p>

<p>
<strong>Role of the Internet in Branding Your Business</strong></p>

<p>The Internet has become a very popular medium for business marketing. You can use websites, blogs, Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, and Pinterest pages to build your brand. The web also facilitates visual branding through video sites like YouTube. If used well, one well-shot video can help you enjoy publicity on a par with some of the biggest brands in the market. South Korean music artist PSY is the perfect example of how the web can help create a global brand in a short time.</p>

<p>
<strong>Do Not Pay Lip Service to Branding</strong></p>

<p>Branding will yield success only if you are sincere and honest about the entire process. Using pirated software when trying to portray yourself as an honest and ethical company in your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Computer-Software/cat_CG5">business marketing</a> campaigns will not yield positive results. You must make sure your small business culture, values, plans, behavior, actions, and results are in harmony with the image you want to create.</p>

<p>Building a brand is not about spending lots of money. However, you cannot avoid essential expenses. A reasonably priced camcorder may prove to be a very good investment if you intend to use video websites to popularize your brand. Spending a couple hundred dollars on an illuminated sign may help increase brand visibility if your office is situated on a busy street.</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Branding doesnt have to wait until you go public. Rather, a strong brand can help you improve growth and boost stability. The success of a venture is determined by its visibility and popularity of its brand amongst the masses, not just by its profit margins.</p>

<title>The 5 Best Strategic Marketing Ideas of the Past Decade </title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Every small business must have a functional and goal-oriented marketing strategy to survive the intense competition in the market today. Try to incorporate the five best strategic marketing ideas of the past decade in your advertising ideas to stay ahead of your competition.</p>

<p>
<strong>Strategic Marketing Ideas Will Offer Real Benefits for Your Business</strong></p>

<p>Terms like strategic marketing ideas may seem irrelevant to a small business owner who is struggling to take care of the firm's production, marketing, sales, and administration activities single-handedly. However, relying on advertising ideas based on strategic marketing plans can help enhance the returns from your marketing efforts.</p>

<p>One popular modern strategic marketing idea is to focus on your customers' customer. Focus on your customer's growth in the market and your growth will take place automatically. Adopting 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Recycled-Paper/cat_CL141400">marketing strategies</a> like gifting recycled paper to your customers will not just enhance your goodwill, but will also help your customers improve their environmentally friendly image amongst their customers.</p>

<p>Are there potential customers who do not even consider the option of giving you business? Why are they so averse to even thinking about you? A marketing strategy will help you identify weaknesses in your advertising ideas and selling strategies.</p>

<p>
<strong>Technology Has Caused a Paradigm Shift in Marketing Strategies</strong></p>

<p>Start treating your small business as a single organic unit. Your customer is not bothered about the lack of coordination between your production and sales department. A delayed delivery affects the reputation of your firm as a whole. Inculcate this mindset amongst your employees as well. Every marketing plan should acknowledge that customers analyze and judge your small business as a whole.</p>

<p>The age of defining marketing in vague and general terms is long past. It was difficult to calculate return on investment (ROI) on 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/flyers.html">advertising ideas</a> that relied on traditional solutions like banners and flyers. Online marketing tools, social marketing strategies, and technological improvements have leveled the playing field. Social media can be used to receive immediate and accurate feedback from customers and stakeholders to determine the success or failure of your marketing strategy.</p>

<p>Blindly using fancy terms without understanding their relevance to your business will not yield any results. You must carry out a holistic analysis of your business and these new ideas before making any changes to your marketing strategy. Poorly thought out changes made in an ad hoc manner will not yield any results.</p>

<p>
<strong>Risks and Costs Involved in Modern Marketing Solutions</strong></p>

<p>Adopting a top-down approach when implementing strategic marketing ideas will not work. Your new marketing strategy will fail if your employees feel that your innovative strategic marketing ideas are mere fads. Alter your recruitment strategy and try to employ experienced and professional marketers who understand the importance of strategic marketing.</p>

<p>Implementing your new marketing strategy may involve unavoidable expenses. Tablet computers costing from $200 each can help your team track online metrics even on the move. A digital projector costing $400 and up will facilitate group analysis of relevant marketing data and help you receive inputs from all your employees.</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>You will be doing a disservice to your business if you ignore these new marketing ideas. Do not expect results overnight. Strategic marketing, if implemented in a holistic manner will yield fantastic and consistent returns over the long term.</p>

<title>Tax Withholding for Small Businesses</title>
<description>Learn what you need to know to prepare and calculate withholding amounts from your employees' paychecks.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>When you own a business that hires employees, it is your responsibility to withhold certain payroll taxes determined by tax rates published by the IRS. You also have to pay your portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes for each employee and send a W-2 to both the employee and the IRS at the end of each year. Keep in mind that you only need to withhold taxes from an employee's paycheck if they are true employees and not independent contractors (ICs).</p>

<p>
<strong>Difference between Employees and ICs</strong></p>

<p>The main difference between an employee and an independent contractor is that with an employee you are able to direct how a job is performed. You can control or oversee each step and manage the employee as they do the work. With an independent contractor, you are only able to dictate what the end result will be, not how the work will get done. If your "employee" has the legal right to control what he or she does in order to complete your project, then that person is an independent contractor. If you have the legal right to dictate level of job performance, then the person is an employee. This distinction is important because you have to pay employment taxes for each employee, whereas independent contractors will pay their own.</p>

<p>
<strong>Filling Out and Updating W-4s</strong></p>

<p>You should have each new employee fill out a W-4 and then have the person update it each year. This is important because if the employee had a child leave the home, had a new baby, got married, had a large refund, or paid a large tax bill in the previous year, their tax status may change. The W-4 will let you know how many exemptions the employee is claiming, which is information you will need to know when using a chart of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/QuickBooks-Pro-1-User-Enhanced-Payroll-Bundle-for-Windows-3-User/product_957718">tax rates</a> provided by the IRS to determine how much to withhold from the employee's paycheck.</p>

<p>
<strong>Using a Chart of Tax Rates</strong></p>

<p>There are two methods that you can use to calculate withholding amounts: the wage method and the percentage method. The wage method is pretty simple since you use a chart of tax rates provided by the IRS to find an employee's income and number of claimed exemptions to determine the withholding amount. The percentage method takes some small mathematical calculations and is little more complicated. It requires you to multiply a daily, weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual withholding allowance by the number of exemptions claimed; subtract that number from the employee's earnings for that pay period; and compare that number with a chart of tax rates provided by the IRS to determine the withholding amount.</p>

<p>Using a chart of tax rates to calculate and withhold 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Payroll-Timesheet-Forms/cat_CL100202">payroll taxes</a> can be complicated and you may even need to hire an accountant to make sure it is done correctly, but it is your responsibility as an employer. Knowing exactly what you need to do the job yourself and how to get it done is a key part of keeping yourself out of trouble with the IRS.</p>

<p>Most business owners get excited at the prospect of receiving a tax refund at the end of the year, but at the same time, successfully completing a tax return can be a stressful process. With the right organizational methods and tools, small business owners will be off to a great start as tax season draws near. Luckily, filing taxes is quicker and more streamlined than it used to be.</p>

<p>
<strong>Introduction to Tax Return Laws, Products, and Tools</strong></p>

<p>Filing a tax return is different for a small business than it is for other types of entities, so it is important to know the basics to ensure that taxes are being reported correctly and that the proper refund amount is calculated. Its also important to become familiar with the basic tax laws for small and medium-sized businesses at the state and federal level. There are also many products and tools available to ease your stress and simplify the tax return process. Receipt collection envelopes, filing cabinets, and accounting software are all tools to help business owners successfully keep track of their tax obligations and obtain a refund at the end of the year. These tools will also save time and improve productivity by keeping your office or work area neat and organized.</p>

<p>
<strong>Small Business Tax Innovations</strong></p>

<p>To help business owners understand and meet their federal tax obligations, the IRS offers virtual small business workshops online and via CD. There are also workshops scheduled all over the country to help business owners obtain a tax refund. Some require a fee, but most are free. There is also a large amount of free information, including worksheets, calendars, and other tools, available on the IRS website.</p>

<p>Before the Internet, filling taxes was much more difficult and time consuming. Profits, losses, and expenses were handwritten in ledgers, and specialized tax accountants would spend days or even weeks gathering the necessary figures together to assess the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Business-Forms/cat_DP1002">business taxes</a> and report them properly to the government. There were no computers to complete complex calculations, no electronic filing methods to speed up the delivery process, and no online banking to get a tax refund quickly.</p>

<p>
<strong>Pricing</strong></p>

<p>To obtain the largest 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/2012-Tax-Forms-Envelopes/cat_CL140847">tax refund</a> possible, you'll have to invest a bit of money into tax preparation. Organize your office, and buy as many organization tools that your budget will allow. This includes file folders, filing cabinets, binders, and shelves. The more organized you are, the easier filing taxes will be.</p>

<p>You should also consider hiring a professional accountant to prepare your business taxes, especially for the first couple of years. Check with several local tax return professionals, as they all have different rates. Owners of small or medium-sized businesses should expect to pay a couple hundred dollars to have an expert prepare and file tax forms.</p>

<p>
<strong>Identify and Correct Common Mistakes</strong></p>

<p>Some tax mistakes can cause a business owner to incur extra fees or be audited. Hiring a professional to file your taxes will reduce the risk of having mistakes on your tax forms. The most common mistakes are:</p>

<p> Forgetting to claim the Small Business Healthcare Tax Credit</p>

<p> Failing to claim the Work Opportunity Tax Credit</p>

<p> Missing the Returning Heroes Tax Credit</p>

<p> Filing the wrong form</p>

<p> Filing for the wrong year</p>

<p>If you receive a notice from the IRS about incorrect tax information, do not simply assume that the IRS is right. You have the option to hire an attorney or visit the local IRS office to clear up any issues.</p>

<p>With a little preparation and education, a small business owner will have a better grasp on filing taxes and obtaining a tax refund. Tax returns aren't as complicated as they were years ago, but it still makes sense to hire a professional accountant to make sure your business taxes are done properly. If there is a mistake, research the problem yourself or hire someone to help you fix it. When getting a tax refund, the most important thing is that you get the amount you deserve.</p>

<title>Small Business Tax Write-Offs: Rules &amp; Regulations</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Running a business can be expensive year-round, but it can also provide good news at tax time. The more business expenses you have, the more you can write off at the end of the year, lowering your taxable profits. Here is some tax help that may lower your overall tax bill.</p>

<p>
<strong>Deducting Car Expenses</strong></p>

<p>You can deduct maintenance costs, car payments, and insurance expenses on the vehicle you use for your business from your business taxes even if you also use the same vehicle for personal use. You will not be able to deduct 100 percent of these expenses unless the vehicle is used only for business purposes, but you can either keep track of the actual expenses you incur when using the vehicle for business purposes or use the standard mileage deduction, which is currently 55.5 cents per mile driven for business reasons. Using the latter figure may be easier when trying to deduct for things other than gas if the vehicle is one that you also use for personal travel.</p>

<p>
<strong>Deducting Travel Expenses</strong></p>

<p>Travel expenses deduction rules are a little more flexible. You can deduct plane, lodging, rental car, and dining costs while on a business-related trip, even if you do other non-business related things at your destination. Just make sure to deduct only your own expenses even if any friends or family have accompanied you.</p>

<p>
<strong>Deducting Home Office Expenses</strong></p>

<p>Many small business owners need 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/HR-Block-at-Home-Premium-Business-2012-State-eFile/product_990270">tax help</a> on this subject. It is common for many small business owners to simply work from their homes, which means they do not have a company car or office-space rental. Specific areas within their homes are usually designated as office space, and many of them therefore want to know if it is okay to deduct some of their home expenses for business purposes. The answer is yes, but only if the space that is used as an office is dedicated solely to business purposes. This may be an entire room or just a corner of the living room. The bigger the space used as a dedicated home office, the bigger the percentage of mortgage payments or electricity costs that can be deducted as business expenses.</p>

<p>
<strong>Deducting Start-Up Expenses</strong></p>

<p>The worst part about starting a business near the end of the year is that you cannot deduct your advertising costs, office rent, utilities, or other expenses until your business is fully operational. Until that point, these costs are considered capital expenses and are capped under IRS rules. As it currently stands, you cannot deduct more than $5,000 in capital expenses within your first business year.</p>

<p>The more legitimate 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Accounting-Forms/cat_CG1283">tax deductions</a> you can take, the less money you will owe. Added to any credits you may receive, this can add up to a very happy tax time for your small business.</p>

<title>Maintain a Small-Company Culture As You Grow</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>A recent online survey studied the aspects of work environments that resulted in happy workers. Early results from the survey proved what antidotal evidence has shown for years: Smaller companies--those with less than 100 people--are happier at work. This is great news for small business owners. Businesses experiencing growth must ask themselves how to keep a small-company culture while still enjoying the increasing profits that result when you grow your business.</p>

<p>
<strong>Small Company Happiness</strong></p>

<p>Before beginning the struggle of maintaining a small company culture, small business owners need to identify which aspects contribute to employee happiness and productivity. Smaller or start up companies have unique methods of doing business that are often a result of lack of personnel, forcing closeness and shared responsibilities among employees.</p>

<p>Small business owners also tend to be more hands-on at all levels of the business. There are few layers of management, allowing the small business owner to stay in touch with most workers and to guide the direction of the business personally. This hands-on guidance allows the owner to create a business culture reflective of his or her ethical beliefs. The personal touch goes both ways, allowing employees the freedom to directly communicate with the owner about complaints and suggestions. This quick two-way communication often leads to a speedy implementation of procedural changes.</p>

<p>
<strong>Keeping the Culture Alive</strong></p>

<p>It isn't easy to keep a small-company culture alive as the company grows. The more personnel a company has, the harder it is for small business owners to maintain the same level of personalized service. The solution is to make certain that the owner's involvement is felt as much as possible, primarily through good communication.</p>

<p>Fast and accurate communication within a company is vital to maintaining a small-company culture within a larger organization. Directives from the owner should be communicated directly to the workers affected. This means all levels of management must work at maintaining a policy of open communication with their employees. Mobile workers must be made to feel like an essential part of the organization as well. This can be done by keeping them connected through company-issued 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/PCs-Laptops-Tablets/cat_CG71">laptop computers</a> or 
<a href=" http://www.staples.com/Mobile-Phones/cat_CL166921">mobile phones</a>. Communication also keeps the ethical sense of the company alive, allowing workers to speak about issues directly with those in charge of making company policies.</p>

<p>A sense of social closeness between employees also aids in maintaining a small-company culture that is beneficial for small business owners. This can be achieved through non-work events ranging from company picnics to softball teams to company-sponsored charity functions manned by employee volunteers.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Maintaining that Small-Company Mindset</strong></p>

<p>Maintaining a small-company mindset isn't free. For example, the cost of keeping mobile workers connected can be high when you consider the establishment of a company network, equipment charges and maintenance fees. The return in productivity can be higher, however, with each dollar spent on technology paid back by the company's ability to have workers who roam far and wide seeking new business or taking existing business directly to the customers.</p>

<p>Where the return is greatest is in the happiness of the workers. Happy workers tend to remain with a company longer, lowering training and severance costs. They're also more productive, taking fewer sick days therefore raising the bottom line. In short, a happy worker is an asset to the company that is worth the cost of creating and continuing a small-company culture regardless of how large your business grows.</p>

<title>How to Choose the Right Bank for Your Small Business</title>
<description>Learn the right questions to ask to help you choose a small business bank that is the right fit today.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Choosing the right small business bank is critical for your growing company. You must find one that you are comfortable with and that is reliable and established. No matter how limited your financial needs are now, start to establish a good working relationship with your bank so that you are in a better position later on to have access to the financial tools that you need.</p>

<p>
<strong>Shop for Tomorrow's Needs Today</strong></p>

<p>If you are just starting out, you may not need much more than a commercial checking account. As your business grows, however, it is almost certain that you will need more in terms of financial services. Whatever small business bank you choose to establish a relationship with, it should be able to meet your growing needs. This may include a small business loan to cover 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Furniture-Chairs-Cabinets/cat_SC2">new office furniture</a>, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Computer-Software/cat_CG5">small-business computer software</a>, a line of credit, financial advice, or even financial information about your industry. Look ahead to where you expect your business to be in five or ten years, and make your decision based on what you might need then.</p>

<p>Once you understand your present and future needs, you are ready to start comparing the features of several different small business banks. Although most small business loans are handled by local banks, you should also consider those banks that have a presence nationally and internationally. Schedule a meeting with one of the bankers, and be sure to come prepared with a list of items you need now or might need in the future. This might include free checking, rebates of foreign ATM fees, access to lines of credit, and any fees that banks might charge. Don't shy away from researching online banks, unless a face-to-face presence and easy access to a brick-and-mortar institution are very important to you.</p>

<p>In a down economy, or even in the years following an economic crisis, loans for small businesses can be difficult to find. In this situation, it is usually the small business banks that are willing to take the risk. In fact, small and midsize banks account for 22 percent of the country's banking assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Company reports that, in 2009, it was responsible for a full 54 percent of small business loans. If you believe you might need to take advantage of a business loan or a line of credit down the road, you may want to focus on small- or medium-size local banks now. Unlike larger banks, small business banks are also often able to make exceptions to the rules much more quickly and easily should you find that what they are offering doesn't exactly fit what you need.</p>

<p>
<strong>You Won't Know if You Don't Ask</strong></p>

<p>The key to getting the answers you need is to ask the right questions. As you start your quest for a small business bank, you are in the driver's seat. Ask the banks what they offer, tell them what you need, and then select the one that is the best fit today and can grow with your company in the years ahead.</p>

<title>Invest in Employee Handbooks </title>
<description>Learn about the importance of policies and procedures for your business.</description>
<link>http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/invest-in-employee-handbooks.html</link>

<content>
<![CDATA[
<p>An employee handbook is a workplace reference guide used to manage employee expectations and define employment guidelines. This documentation is important to guide both employees and managers, as well as to ensure that important regulations are followed. Writing policies can seem daunting but is a task that can be made simple through software, templates, and expert guidance.</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits of Employee Handbooks</strong></p>

<p>Depending upon the needs of your business, you can design an employee handbook to be either formal or casual. For extremely small businesses that may have only a handful of workers, an employee manual can be just a few pages, explaining the most important information on conduct. Larger business handbooks may span dozens of pages, creating an intricate system of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Employee-Management/cat_CL164585">HR policies</a> and procedures.</p>

<p>Employee handbooks allow personnel to understand:</p>

<p> Work/life information, including time off and work schedules</p>

<p> Behavior guidelines, including at-work and off-duty expectations</p>

<p> Interpersonal standards, including policies against harassment and discrimination</p>

<p>In addition, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Labor-Law-Safety-Posters/cat_CL140895">employee handbooks</a> establish HR policies and management parameters. This benefits the company by providing:</p>

<p> Clear and concise information, avoiding erroneous interpretations</p>

<p> Standardized behaviors, holding all personnel to uniform requirements</p>

<p> Legal and regulatory adherence, for businesses guided by industry-specific rules</p>

<p>
<strong>Employee Handbooks in Todays Workforce</strong></p>

<p>Employee manuals have evolved and become living and breathing documents. Not long ago, an employee may have received a bulky book of policies on their first day of work. Those policies may have been written once and used for many years. The pace of technology these days, changing work/life expectations, and social norms has dictated that this documentation become easier to update and share.</p>

<p>Several innovations business owners or HR managers can take advantage of, to effortlessly create and manage employee guidelines include:</p>

<p> Fill in the blank" software or policy templates, to guide development through standard employee governance areas</p>

<p> Company intranet or shared drives, to ensure policies are readily available</p>

<p> Document collaboration sites, to draw feedback and encourage cooperative policy design</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Compliance</strong></p>

<p>When you consider how much it may cost your company for software or policy experts, take into account the high cost of non-compliance and poor employee conduct and management. Those potential repercussions are a compelling reason to ensure you have an employee handbook worthy of becoming a textbook guideline or sample. Beyond that, clear expectations and guidelines can lead to enhanced employee engagement and efficiency.</p>

<p>The cost of software to develop policies can range upwards of several hundred dollars. You may also bear the cost of hiring expert-level contractors to ensure policies are designed specific to your organization. Simpler organizations that require simpler policies may decide to use in-house personnel to craft an employee manual. In this case, consult knowledgeable sites on the internet to view easily customizable samples.</p>

<p>Employee handbooks including HR policies and employee guidance are a must for businesses of any size. Building adequate documentation can ensure that employees and managers perform to expectations and comply with regulations. You can rely on easy-to-use forms and evolving software to ensure your business builds and maintains the employee manuals it needs to run smoothly.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Small business owners can run into a wide variety of legal issues that aren't normally encountered with partnerships or corporations. This is due to the fact that many owners retain sole ownership of the business. And this sole ownership, without a corporate structure, often leaves small business owners open to personal liability issues. To avoid having business issues affect your personal nonbusiness related assets, there are a few legal tips you should follow when getting your business off the ground.</p>

<p>
<strong>Ten Legal Tips for Business Safety</strong></p>

<p>Running your small business means having to deal with a number of legal concerns. To avoid costly mistakes, remember these important legal tips:</p>

<ul>

<li>1. Make certain your contract workers are actually considered contractors and not employees. The IRS treats contractor and employee payment differently. To ensure those working for you are considered contractors, make sure they sign an agreement that states their status.</li>
</ul>

<div></div>

<ul>

<li>2. Pay all of your bills on time to avoid fees and lawsuits.</li>
</ul>

<div></div>

<ul>

<li>3. Pay payroll taxes on time to avoid being held personally liable.</li>
</ul>

<div></div>

<ul>

<li>4. Make sure your contracts are legally binding by having them all in writing. This includes receipts for goods and services.</li>
</ul>

<div></div>

<ul>

<li>5. To protect your personal assets, purchase business liability insurance, limit company debt, incorporate your company, or form a limited-liability company.</li>
</ul>

<div></div>

<ul>

<li>6. Perform a trademark or patent search for all brand names or products you wish to bring to market. This will avoid hefty bills should a product contain a patented device or process and will also eliminate the frustration of having to rebrand a product and then reestablish its new name in the market.</li>
</ul>

<div></div>

<ul>

<li>7. Protect your company's integrity by having employees sign a noncompete agreement upon hiring. This will prevent them from using your company's trade secrets. It's also a good policy to have employees sign an arbitration agreement so that you can handle employee-employer issues through an arbitration process rather than through a lawsuit.</li>
</ul>

<div></div>

<ul>

<li>8. Provide terms of services agreements for customers detailing your precise obligations and the customer's rights with a product or service.</li>
</ul>

<div></div>

<ul>

<li>9. Make certain you read the fine print of any contract before signing it as well as the terms of service agreement of any product used in your business. This can avoid unexpected costs and future product restrictions.</li>
</ul>

<div></div>

<ul>

<li>10. Find a trustworthy lawyer, familiar with your particular industry, to handle common legal issues. It's also important to seek quality legal advice during a conflict with a partner, customer, or vendor to limit your legal liability.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Keeping Track of Your Business</strong></p>

<p>Recordkeeping is just as important as remaining on the legal side of doing business. You'll want to prove your side of things in any conflict, so you'll need to maintain clear and concise records of your business dealings. For easy access and storage, make sure you get a good set of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/All-Vertical-File-Cabinets/cat_CL70400">filing cabinets</a>. If security is important, opt for locked cabinets. It may also prove valuable to maintain a second set of files off-premises in case of fire or flood.</p>

<p>For electronic documents, an 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/External-Hard-Drives/cat_CL160403">external hard drive</a> can provide you with plenty of backup space. You may also consider keeping an electronic copy off-site using a data storage service in order to give yourself the same protection for loss as you have with off-site storage of physical documents.</p>

<p>
<strong>Establish Legal-Mined Activities at Startup</strong></p>

<p>It's vital to plan ahead when establishing many of the legal tips listed. You'll want to begin thinking in terms of limiting liability immediately upon starting your own business. The severity of a legal issue can be relative. What would be an annoying contract snafu years into your small business' lifecycle could be a business-crippling legal matter if you're just starting out. However, with the ten tips listed, you can limit the damage from common legal issues and keep your business safe.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>When you have spent time and effort working on your business, you normally expect your sales to grow over time. However, there are aspects of content marketing that can make or break your business, so it's important to be aware of them if you're really serious about making your online business a success. You need to determine whether your site, social media, and consumer information areas are up to par to be sure you'll do well in online sales.</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Look at the Design of Your Site</strong></p>

<p>Make sure your blog, webpage, or business site looks attractive. You may think that paying a graphic or Web designer to create your site or page is unnecessary, but you'll want to make the best impression possible on potential buyers. Is the page easy to navigate? Is the resolution high enough so that visitors can read it well and view images easily? 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Custom+Marketing+Materials/directory_Custom+Marketing+Materials">Content marketing</a> relies on consumers making a purchase and talking about your site to others, so make sure the page is simple to use.</p>

<p>
<strong>2. Tone down Aggression</strong></p>

<p>You dont want your page to be too aggressive. There is nothing more irritating than being pushed to buy something that you don't need. Lean toward delivering more educational and entertaining content for your audience instead. You'll have more returning visitors to your site and more potential customers for your business.</p>

<p>
<strong>3. Talk to Customers</strong></p>

<p>Add interest through videos, Twitter, and more. You want consumers to see that you are accessible and responsive. Vary the content on your site, show how a product works through a video, and have a well-rounded experience for the people who are interested in your products. This will help them make better decisions about the purchases they want to make.</p>

<p>
<strong>4. Share for More Interest</strong></p>

<p>Don't make it hard to share the page and information. Sites that put blocks on images and prevent sharing links actually hurt sales. With the way that 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/marketing/directory_marketing">branding</a> on social media has exploded in popularity, content marketing can reach more people faster than ever, so make sure it's easy for others to spread the word.</p>

<p>
<strong>5. Add Outside Information</strong></p>

<p>Do you have references, news reports, press coverage, or other media coverage that shows off your business's branding? Content marketing strategy allows you to use these items to talk about your products with a reference to back your opinion. Mix in your own opinions and reviews to add to the content, but remember that official news coverage and press releases is the content that really indicates the professional level of your business.</p>

<p>
<strong>6. Give Them All You Have</strong></p>

<p>Don't leave people wanting more from your site. If a consumer can't find information through the content marketing that you've provided, he or she will leave and find a site that does. This means you'll lose sales and, in the end, a customer. Offer links to information that return consumers to your page, and you will be more likely to make the sale. In conclusion, make sure your company succeeds by providing content marketing that gives the consumers what they want. Provide entertainment, information, and easy access, and you'll be one step ahead of the rest.</p>

<p>Tax time is the one time that businesses can really turn income lemons, such as nonpaying customers and personal loans for business expenses, into lemonade by using the tax deductions and business tax credits available under certain circumstances. Here are five tax-saving tips that will help your small business this tax season.</p>

<p>
<strong>Gather Up All of Your Unpaid Invoices</strong></p>

<p>Whether they are from this year or a previous year, you can write off unpaid invoices that you have not previously claimed during tax time. If you missed this deduction from previous years and have a lot of unpaid invoices sitting around collecting dust, then you can get really nice 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/HR-Block-at-Home-Premium-Business-2012-State-eFile/product_990270">tax deductions</a> to lower your taxable profit without any loss of actual income for the current year. If this is your first year in business, make sure you keep and claim these invoices on your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Accounting-Forms/cat_CG1283">small business taxes</a>.</p>

<p>
<strong>Turn to Household Bills for Potential Tax Deductions</strong></p>

<p>If you work from home and have an office that is a dedicated work space for your business, you can write off part of your mortgage payment, insurance costs, and utility bills on your business return to get more tax deductions. If you use your personal car for business purposes, you can write off a portion of your car payment, insurance, and maintenance costs too. Also, don't forget to write off a portion of your Internet and cell phone bills if you use them for business purposes, especially if you have a dedicated business line.</p>

<p>
<strong>Write Off the Interest on a Personal Loan</strong></p>

<p>If you used a personal loan to fund start-up or operating costs for your business, then you can write off the interest as a business expense on your return to get bigger tax deductions. Although it is wise not to put yourself into personal debt to fund your business, if you are already in this situation, use it to help yourself and your business at tax time.</p>

<p>
<strong>Bill for December Services in January</strong></p>

<p>This will allow you to defer claiming that income until the next tax year, which can be especially advantageous if doing so will keep you in a lower tax bracket. This is one way to reduce your tax payment for the year without tax deductions or business tax credits. The risk you take here is bumping yourself into a higher tax bracket next year, but you can always employ this tip again for next season if it will help lower your tax bill.</p>

<p>
<strong>Don't Forget to Deduct Start-Up Costs</strong></p>

<p>If this is your first year in business or you have carry-over start-up costs that you still have not claimed, then this is a good time to do so and grab a few extra tax deductions for your business. The only downside is that you may not be able to deduct all of your start-up expenses for the first year, because capital expenses are capped at $5,000. If you have more than that, you can roll it over into tax deductions for future years.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the tax deductions that will help lower your business tax bill for the year, whether you are a corporation or a sole proprietor. While some of these can only be utilized by those who work from home, most are available for all small business owners to enjoy.</p>

<p>
<em>In this article, we look at three things that often stand in the way of getting a small business loan approved. Learn about the reasons for these roadblocks  and specific ways to move past them. </em></p>

<p>Having a loan application denied is never fun, but it's not the end of the line. Here are three common reasons why banks deny loans, and what you can do in response.</p>

<h2>
<strong>1) Low Personal Credit Score</strong></h2>

<p>Your FICO score  or personal credit record as compiled by credit bureaus TransUnion, Equifax and Experian  is just one element that banks consider in a loan application. However, it's often given great weight.</p>

<p>Lenders will almost always need to see your personal credit score in your business loan application. If the score doesn't meet their standards, they may put the brakes on.</p>

<p>
<em>What You Can Do</em></p>

<p>Different lenders can have different FICO tolerances, depending on who is underwriting their loans. Although banks usually don't advertise this information, try to get a general idea of your lender's FICO criteria from a loan officer before you even start your application.</p>

<p>You can also improve your personal credit score by catching up on late payments, or getting a new credit card and being diligent about paying it off every month.</p>

<h2>
<strong>2) Risky Business</strong></h2>

<p>If your business is cyclical in nature, has thin profit margins or is just plain unconventional (the case for many online startups), a lender may consider the venture too risky to finance. Loan officers need to be convinced there will be a steady income stream to support loan payments or some collateral to fall back on if the business fails.</p>

<p>
<em>What You Can Do</em></p>

<p>Risk is in the eye of the beholder. Some banks are more tolerant of risk than others. Here again, it pays to do your homework before applying with a lender. Find out if your bank lends to anyone else in your industry or profession. Alternatively, ask others with similar businesses where they got their financing.</p>

<p>Another way to make lenders more comfortable with your application is by providing extra security. This can take the form of a personal guarantee or co-signer. Both of these strategies can carry serious financial liability, so think hard about whether you want to put your or your co-signer's personal assets at risk for the sake of your business.</p>

<h2>
<strong>3) Personnel Issues</strong></h2>

<p>Loan officers are people too, and some are better at their jobs than others. Your application may get denied through no fault of your own, but rather due to an officer's lack of experience or organization in presenting the loan package to an underwriter.</p>

<p>
<em>What You Can Do</em></p>

<p>If your bank representative can't communicate why your application was denied or if you suspect he or she is missing important information, try appealing to a superior. That person may have more knowledge of your industry or be better able to negotiate terms.</p>

<p>Above all, don't be discouraged by denial. Keep trying, and remember to learn from your experiences. Even a bank that turns you down can be a useful source of information for improving your chances with the next one.</p>

<p>
<em>Social media offers businesses a chance to eavesdrop on what customers think of their products and services. Unfortunately, many small businesses continue to miss this valuable opportunity.</em></p>

<p>Sherlock Holmes famously chastised Doctor Watson because he saw but did not observe. When it comes to social media many a business listens, but does not hear, or hears but does not respond.</p>

<p>InSite Consulting surveyed 1,222 managers and business owners from the U.S. and Europe on the importance of social media. The company discovered that while 80 percent of U.S. companies have a social media presence, only 61 percent actually listen to business-related social media chatter. A mere 54 percent take the next logical step and engage in social media conversations.</p>

<p>The numbers show a disconnect between business attitudes and the growing importance of social media. It's estimated a single negative tweet or Facebook post can cost a business 30 customers. Knowing who's talking about you online  and what theyre saying  can save your business from significant losses.</p>

<h2>Eavesdropping on Social Media</h2>

<p>What should you search for on social media? Start by looking for any reference to your business name, products and services. Include nicknames, abbreviations and misspellings in your search.</p>

<p>Seasonal campaigns, sales and special offers also crop up in social media. You may also wish to search the names of business owners, CEOs and stockholders.</p>

<p>After you get a feel for how your own business appears on social media, run similar searches for your competitors. If your online reputation is worse than competitors, try to determine what other companies do well. Similarly, if you have a good online rep and your competitors are struggling, find out what theyre doing wrong so you dont make the same mistakes.</p>

<h2>Tracking Social Media</h2>

<p>You could run social media searches manually, but daily searches take time. Instead, use one of the many free or low-cost social media trackers available online.</p>

<p>Apps such as Hootsuite and Social Mention, coupled with free services such as Google Alerts, take much of the tedium out of social media monitoring. Many of these apps also allow users to post comments and schedule posting times.</p>

<h2>Customer Service and Social Media</h2>

<p>Listening to social media chatter is only the beginning. To leverage social media effectively you need to talk to your customers.</p>

<p>If someone makes a post praising you products, thank them for their kind words (and maybe offer them a one-time discount). If someone makes a negative comment, ask what your company can do to resolve the problem. Even if the customer remains unsatisfied, you're making it clear you take customer service seriously.</p>

<p>Get involved with message boards, forums and other sites where your business name (or those of your competitors) crops up. Becoming an active participant in such conversations increases your brand awareness and reputation.</p>

<h2>Maintaining a Social Media Presence</h2>

<p>InSite estimated 80 percent of U.S. companies have a social media presence, but many businesses treat social media pages like static web pages.</p>

<p>A social media page requires frequent attention. Add photos of new products, offer special discounts to social media users and link to your business's website.</p>

<p>Most importantly, read what people post. Ask social media followers what they'd like to see in new services. Take informal polls on customer satisfaction or run social media-specific contests. The more positive comments you generate, the better your online reputation becomes</p>

<title>The Eight Biggest Social Media Customer Service Fails of 2012</title>

<em>Social media offers great rewards for the business willing to brave its dangers. Wrong turns and poor decisions can turn a social media campaign into a disaster.</em></p>

<p>Social media offers great opportunities for businesses to create an online presence, interact with customers and build brand reputation. Its a bold new marketing frontier, and like any new frontier, you can expect setbacks and dangers. Here are seven common social media mistakes you can't afford to ignore.</p>

<h2>You Can't Score Goals without Kicking the Ball</h2>

<p>With all the pitfalls surrounding social media, it's not surprising some companies choose not to access the medium. Avoiding social media has serious downsides, however.</p>

<p>Customers expect companies to have social media presence, and will question any company that doesnt. Besides, not using social media means you avoid the benefits as well as the risks of a rapidly growing business field. You can't win if you dont play.</p>

<h2>Playing without a Ball</h2>

<p>Getting involved in social media does not mean leaping in headfirst. You need a plan. What venue is better for you, Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest? What sites do your clients use?</p>

<p>You need to know what you want to say and who you'll be saying it to instead of posting without any direction.</p>

<h2>Newsjacking Disasters</h2>

<p>Referencing news stories in your Twitter feed or Facebook page can generate increased traffic. Called "newsjacking," the practice backfires if you reference serious news in a flippant or manipulative fashion.</p>

<p>During Hurricane Sandy, companies tweeted about everything from hurricane sales to hurricane-themed nail polish. Readers called these companies out for trying to generate sales off the backs of people living in the storms path.</p>

<p>A better approach? Announce you're offering a popular item for sale and donating a portion of the sale to help hurricane victims.</p>

<h2>Overselling Yourself</h2>

<p>Overselling offers one the fastest way to fail in social media. Many businesses assume Facebook and Twitter are simply new advertising venues, and every post focuses on making sales. The result? People stay away.</p>

<p>Social media builds relationships with clients, customers and fans over time. While it's perfectly acceptable to occasionally post about special sales, events or campaigns, leave aggressive sales pitches for other venues.</p>

<h2>Snit Fits</h2>

<p>At one time or another, almost all businesses receive criticism online, from constructive evaluations of your customer service to wild-eyed "go die in a fire" insults. You need to respond to these complaints; two-way communication is vital in social media.</p>

<p>Angry, snippy posts are a huge mistake. Not only does an ill-thought out, insult-filled response damage your online reputation, it also attracts more trolls and insulting comments. Be firm, be fair, and above all, be courteous.</p>

<h2>Lacking a Voice</h2>

<p>A social media presence requires a voice: a personality people attach to your product or service. A voice adds consistency to your social media presence, and helps channel both what you say and how you say it.</p>

<p>The voice need not be business-like: Skittles, for instance, uses a playful tone with its tweets that meshes well with its product. On the other hand, a funeral home needs a more respectful, considerate tone.</p>

<h2>Not Listening</h2>

<p>You can make all manner of mistakes with social media, but perhaps the most disastrous is not listening to your audience. Social media is all about communication.</p>

<p>A business cannot carry a one-way conversation with social media followers and expect good results. You need to talk, share and yes, occasionally argue, with your followers (bearing in mind the cardinal rule of courtesy even in heated debate).</p>

<title>Five New Ways to Ask the Traditional Interview Questions</title>
<description>Shake things up a bit with behavioral interviewing tactics.</description>

<p>
<em>Traditional job interview questions are so common job applicants can accurately predict what questions they have to answer. Shake things up a bit with behavioral interviewing tactics.</em></p>

<p>Next time you need to fill a job position, toss the old, predictable questions out the window and give behavioral interviewing a try. Instead of asking generic questions, behavioral interviews ask for specific examples of how interviewees use job skills and respond to challenges.</p>

<p>With traditional questions, interviewees have plenty of opportunity to "pad" their answers and prepare for questions in advance. Behavioral interviews ask for specifics, making it difficult for an interviewee to gloss over shortcomings.</p>

<p>Below are five common job interview questions and more insightful behavioral interview alternatives.</p>

<h2>What are your strengths?</h2>

<p>You just know this question will have a rote response. Interviewees talk about strengths they think you'll find desirable, whether or not they actually possess those strengths.</p>

<p>Instead, ask interviewees to describe work situations where they used their unique skill sets. By asking them to talk about their actions in specific situations, you can better evaluate their abilities.</p>

<h2>What are Your Weaknesses?</h2>

<p>Its almost pointless asking this question. Interviewees announce their "weaknesses" are working too hard, being too committed to company productivity or other examples of thinly disguised strengths.</p>

<p>Behavioral interviewers ask interviewees to describe situations where they lacked skills or experience. How did they resolve the issue? What steps did they take to acquire necessary skills? Even if the original situation resulted in failure, how an interviewee handles failure could speak well of her.</p>

<h2>How do You like to Spend Your Free Time?</h2>

<p>This isn't a bad question to ask in and of itself, but really, what's the interviewee going to say? That he spends his weekends playing Halo 3? Of course not. He's going to try to make himself out to be a family man, a community volunteer or a driven athlete.</p>

<p>Ask the interviewee to describe a situation in which he used work-related skills in a non-work environment, or used skills from his personal life at work. You get a better sense of the interviewee's adaptability, and he doesn't make himself out to be a skydiving version of Mother Teresa.</p>

<h2>Would You Describe Yourself as Goal Driven?</h2>

<p>Another common traditional interview question that, once you look at it closely, doesn't tell you anything about the interviewee. Naturally she's going to say she's goal-drivenwould you say any different in a job interview?</p>

<p>Again, use behavioral questions to dig up specifics. Ask the interviewee to describe a situation in which she set a specific goal and worked towards it. Follow up with questions on how she managed time and resources.</p>

<h2>How Would You Handle Conflicts with an Employer or Manager?</h2>

<p>Granted, this is a difficult question to answer, but only in the sense that interviewees need to gauge how your company handles staff conflicts.</p>

<p>Most people have some experience with on-the-job conflicts, so instead ask the interviewee to describe a time he was in conflict with a co-worker or superior. How did he handle the event? What was the cause and outcome? The answers will be more informative, and more realistic than asking him how he'd handle a hypothetical situation.</p>

<title>Five Simple Tips for Effective Small Business Leadership</title>
<description>Keep your workforce enthused and effective with these tips.</description>

<p>
<em>Want to know the best ways to keep your workforce enthused and effective? Check out these simple steps.</em></p>

<p>Leading a small business is quite different from working on your own. The budgets get bigger, the problems get tougher and the number of people who depend on you suddenly begins to multiply. You can't just rely on your wits and wherewithal anymore; you must rely on other individuals too.</p>

<p>How can you lead your business with passion and consistency? Read on for five simple steps.</p>

<h2>1) Hire Good People</h2>

<p>Start with hiring. Small business owners tend to make a lot of mistakes in personnel when they're starting out, but wisdom and experience can sharpen these skills. Look for people who can problem-solve, who can communicate lucidly and who "get" your company's culture. Then give these people your time and resources to show you value what they bring.</p>

<h2>2) Be Clear</h2>

<p>It can be a rocky transition, moving from self-reliance to collaboration. One of the chief sources of confusion is clarity: Many first-time business owners are unaccustomed to having to explain what's in their head. Don't assume that because your staff is bright, they can read your mind. Work on communicating clear signposts, deadlines and goals for the projects you undertake. And check in frequently to confirm you're being heard.</p>

<h2>3) Nurture the Gifted</h2>

<p>There's nothing quite as exciting as nabbing a uniquely talented employee. But it can be all too easy to take that talent for granted over time. Don't forget to reward performance with greater responsibilities and compensation. Make a habit of reviewing your workforce to surface the exceptional performers. And put some thought into how your stars can add further value to the companyand how you can add value for them.</p>

<h2>4) Think Ahead</h2>

<p>Leaders don't just look inward at their workforce; they must also look outward at the landscape ahead. Set aside some time each week for a "periscope view" of the greater forces that may be disrupting your industry. Is a digital wave coming that could wipe out what you make? Might future computing frontiers help you reach a wider audience? Vision: It's a job.</p>

<h2>5) Listen</h2>

<p>The military uses the phrase "force multiplier" to refer to any tactic or technology that makes the power of its soldiers greater than their numbers. Listening to employees is a force multiplier for your business. Your employees can expand your mind with richer ideas, making you far more effective than you would be on your own. Seek out this feedback and don't be afraid to hear candid assessments.</p>

<h2>Summing It All Up</h2>

<p>
<strong></strong>Anyone can be a great business leader with some care, energy and curiosity. If you can keep your people enthused and empowered, and keep your company looking forward, you can survive just about anything the market throws at you.</p>

<title>Shorten Your Workweek by Automating These Simple Repeat Tasks</title>

<blockquote>
<p>From streamlining meetings to setting up repeat office supply orders, follow these automation tips for optimizing business operations.</p></blockquote>

<div></div>

<div>Henry Ford figured it out a century ago: By automating repeatable processes, you'll complete a project more efficiently. But you don't need to be speeding up a production line and pumping out automobiles to use that insight for small business operations.</div>

<div>

<p>Many tasks around the office usually take more time than they should. By streamlining these seemingly minor actions, you can save time for what you really want to be doing: building your business.</p>

<p>Here are some areas where automation can create more effective operations:</p>

<p>
<strong>Vendor Meetings</strong></p>

<p>Depending on what type of vendors you have, meetings can take the form of in-person check-ins or email communications. Businesses often check in with vendors on the fly, which can add up to several interactions every week.</p>

<p>
<em>Automate: </em>Schedule a time weekly or monthly, depending on your usual level of vendor interaction. Notify vendors that this will be a standing check-in time, even if it's over email. This will not only concentrate all vendor interactions into a shorter timeframe, but also let you see trends in shipping, distribution, product quality and other issues more easily.</p>

<p>Most likely, this standing meeting time will get condensed as people become familiar with the system. So schedule a few hours at the beginning and set an ultimate goal (e.g., one hour every Tuesday morning).</p>

<p>
<strong>Office Supply Orders</strong></p>

<p>Checking on supply levels for office standards like printer cartridges, paper, pens, flash drives and other items might take only an hour or two, but it distracts you from more important work.</p>

<p>
<em>Automate:</em> Create a system that automatically orders a standard set of supplies, based on your needs. If you're unsure of what's required, review orders from the past three to four months and track ordering of regular supplies (as opposed to one-time purchases like desk calendars or software packages). Consider using a single office product supplier to make the automated strategy even more efficient. Then, contact that vendor to set up a system.</p>

<p>
<strong>Invoicing</strong></p>

<p>Much like vendor meetings or office supply orders, some invoicing is done on a consistent basis every month. Creating each invoice from scratch and sending it to a vendor may be taking more time than you realize.</p>

<p>
<em>Automate: </em>Several software programs let you streamline invoice management and automate payments. Although this approach might take a few hours to set up, it's worth the time since it can free you up in the future. An added bonus: It tends to reduce errors and late payments, which means more cash in your pocket.</p>

<p>There are other areas where automation can be beneficial to the business as well. In general, take a look at your operations and see where you might be doing the same tasks every month. From there, aim to develop a system to increase operational effectiveness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few letters here and couple packages there can soon add up to a sizeable shipping bill for your small business. Find out how to keep costs manageable with these basic tips.</p></blockquote>

<div></div>

<div>For small businesses, shipping costs can creep upward quickly. What starts as a few letters and packages becomes a marketing-campaign mailing or an uptick in product distribution. Soon, your shipping costs are multiplying, and you fear there's no end in sight.</div>

<p>But there are ways to keep those costs in check. Here are some strategies for minimizing shipping expenses without reducing business effectiveness.</p>

<p>
<strong>Outsource Shipping Tasks</strong></p>

<p>Part of the cost of shipping is labor. Even if you're the one boxing up product samples or addressing envelopes, think about how your time could be better spent. Using a retail solution, such as Staples, will free you up to focus on business tasks rather than shipping chores.</p>

<p>
<strong>Eliminate Post Office Visits</strong></p>

<p>Small business owners often spend far too much time standing in line at the post office. Skip the hassle and arrange pickup instead. If you have at least one Priority or Express mail item (and no single package weighs more than 70 pounds), the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) will pick up your shipment. And that includes outgoing mail.</p>

<p>
<strong>Create a Shipping Schedule</strong></p>

<p>Some midsize and larger companies streamline shipping by sticking to a schedule for outgoing shipments. You can do this on a smaller scale by choosing one day per week for shipping and then scheduling pickup for that day. That will let you track trends in terms of volume and costs, and subsequently work to reduce expenses based on those trends.</p>

<p>
<strong>Buy Stamps Wisely</strong></p>

<p>Some online services allow you to print postage from your computer, Although this can be a good way to save time, it can also be a bad way to spend your money. Look closely at the types of fees charged for each item, including a basic usage fee, and you might be surprised at how quickly postage adds up. Instead of paying subscription fees, find free online tools, such as the USPS's Click-N-Ship for Business service.</p>

<div>Shipping costs may be modest for your small business now, but if you're not careful, they could add up in the future. Take control and streamline your strategies now.</div>

<title>Five Effective Outsourcing Techniques for Your Small Business</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Outsourcing can be a scary word for a small business owner, but it doesn't have to be. Find out how strategic outsourcing can help you tap into broader expertise and give your business a boost.</p></blockquote>

<div>
<strong>
</strong></div>

<div>Outsourcing can seem like a daunting strategy that adds more moving pieces to your business. But done correctly, it can add layers of expertise, release you from tedious chores and let you concentrate on running your business more effectively.</div>

<div>

<p>Here are five steps to follow for better outsourcing.</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Identify Needs</strong></p>

<p>In considering outsourcing relationships, first look at tasks that might take longer because you're doing work solo or with a small staff. Areas might include IT support, accounting, hiring or basic tasks like photocopying or shipping. Begin to identify which parts of your business could benefit from speed and knowledge.</p>

<p>
<strong>2. Start New Vendors on Small Projects</strong></p>

<p>Developing relationships with vendors begins with getting an idea about how they work. For that, it's much better to start with a modest task than with a larger, complicated project. Asking a recruiting firm to find a new administrative assistant, for example, will give you an idea about their effectiveness for when you need a new C-level executive.</p>

<p>
<strong>3. Create the Paperwork</strong></p>

<p>For most outsourced projects, you really should have a nondisclosure contract in place. Unless you're outsourcing the most routine of tasks, you're likely handing over business information. It's vital to make sure you're protected.</p>

<p>
<strong>4. Be Open to Vendor Ideas</strong></p>

<p>Although vendors will work on your project as directed, don't hesitate to ask for their advice on various matters. For example, if a representative from 
<a title="Staples tech services" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/get-help-now/">Staples tech services</a> is setting up your wireless equipment, she may have ideas about how to increase your overall security as well. Be open to tapping into vendors' expertise, and you'll create a team of pros who work together for your business.</p>

<p>
<strong>5. See Outsourcing as an Opportunity</strong></p>

<p>Outsourcing doesn't have to mean setting up a call center in India or having an army of business consultants trying to re-make your business. Instead, you can use the strategy on a more modest scale to release you from tasks that otherwise would take up too much time. For instance, 
<a title="Staples Copy and Print" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/programs/copyandprint/">Staples Copy &amp;amp; Print</a> can create presentation graphics or report binding, reducing the time you spend over a copier preparing for a client meeting.</p>

<p>From business card printing to CEO searches, outsourcing can be useful at multiple levels of a business. The key is devising an outsourcing strategy that makes sense for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Holding on to great employees can be a challenge for small business owners. Check out these handy tips on keeping your top talent happy and productive.</p></blockquote>

<div></div>

<p>Strange, but true: In the typical small business, your two or three most talented employees may be more valuable than everyone else combined. Small companies tend to rely on just a few people to get the lion's share of difficult work done, so it's important to reward and retain these top performers.</p>

<p>How can you protect the stars in your stable? Read on.</p>

<p>
<strong>Communication</strong></p>

<p>Good communication means more than just providing feedbackit means listening too. Frequently, employees who do the best work have good ideas as well. Solicit their opinions about important decisions, and don't be afraid to shelve your own ideas if better ones arise.</p>

<p>Top talent likes to know it's being heard, and your employees are far more likely to stick around if they feel they have a stake in your company's future.</p>

<p>
<strong>Responsibility</strong></p>

<p>Talented people tend to be versatile as well. One of the easiest ways to keep your performers happy is to increase their responsibilities. Let them weigh in on a broad array of projects, and hand them the reins on something particularly challenging.</p>

<p>Employees who are especially competent often shine when the pressure is on. So don't be afraid to throw them into the deep end as a sign of your faith in their abilities.</p>

<p>
<strong>Freedom</strong></p>

<p>Another good way to show your employees that you appreciate their efforts is to give them more freedom in their work. Effective employees tend to be proactive, so you can increase their productivity by offering fewer restrictions on their time.</p>

<p>Think of the tremendous morale boost Google gets from its famous 20 percent rule, where employees are required to devote one-fifth of their time to whatever they're most excited about.</p>

<p>
<strong>Rewards</strong></p>

<p>And of course, there are always incentives. While bonuses are a perennial favorite, you may get some extra mileage from devising more personal rewards.</p>

<p>Consider your employees' passions: Would they appreciate tickets to a certain show? A chance to attend a hot seminar? Your top performers will notice if you're thinking carefully about what they like and tuning your incentives to their needs.</p>

<p>
<strong>Above All, Pay Attention</strong></p>

<div>In the end, your best employees just want what we all want: affirmation and fulfillment. Build an environment that facilitates candid communication and meaningful rewards, and you'll be more successful in retaining the people who make your business great.</div>

<title>The IRS Cometh: Best Practices for Closing the 2012 Tax Season</title>
<description>Accurately closing your 2012 fiscal books helps take the pain out of tax season.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Accurately closing your 2012 fiscal books helps take the pain and frustration out of tax season.</p></blockquote>

<div></div>

<div>The end of the calendar year coincides with the end of the fiscal year for most small businesses and sole proprietors. Close the books on the fiscal year with care, because these are the numbers entered on your tax return.</div>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Business and Personal Spending</strong></p>

<p>Small businesses, especially those run by a single person, can get a little lax with their accounting systems. Business and personal expenses can intertwine, adding to the confusion. Does the new laptop you bought for work count as a business expense if the kids game on it? Does your Costco card count as a work expense if you buy groceries as well as office supplies?</p>

<p>Keep business and personal expenses separate, using different accounts for each. Otherwise, you're going to have unnecessary headaches at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Home businesses probably won't have separate utility bills for the business office and the rest of the house. Remember you can claim a portion of electricity, heat and mortgage payments as business expenses, so account for these expenses when closing the books.</p>

<p>
<strong>Accounting Software</strong></p>

<p>Some small businesses take the "shoebox" approach to taxes, shoving any business-related paperwork and receipts into a single box and dropping the mess on an accountant's lap come tax time.</p>

<p>Accounting software makes life easier for both you and your accountant. Programs such as Intuit's QuickBooks allow you to input expenses, invoices and income on a daily basis, and automate many of the calculations needed for closing the books.</p>

<p>
<strong>Monthly Statements </strong></p>

<p>Closing the yearly books is similar to managing your monthly accounts. You need to reconcile bank and credit card statements, take inventory, pay taxes, calculate payroll and transfer uncategorized income and expenses to the general ledger.</p>

<p>Closing each month's books carefully and consistently makes closing the fiscal year much easier, as most of the calculations are already completed. You can work with the end-of-month balances instead of starting from scratch.</p>

<p>
<strong>Annual Inventory</strong></p>

<p>End-of-year financial housekeeping should include a thorough inventory check. Taking inventory isnt exactly a thrill-a-minute activity, and seems even worse in the dead of winter, but it's important to get an accurate accounting of stock before closing the books.</p>

<p>Determine how much stock has been lost, stolen or damaged and reconcile this with the value of your inventory assets. While youre at it, calculate the depreciated value of any fixed assets and adjust the general ledger accordingly.</p>

<p>
<strong>End of Year Expenditures and Income</strong></p>

<p>You may want to decrease income and increase spending at the end of the fiscal year. Any profits or invoices you can put off until January will decrease your income for the current tax year.</p>

<p>Similarly, increase your expenditures in December if possible. Paying January's bills early, stocking up on office supplies and making larger fixed asset purchases at this time reduce your upcoming tax bill.</p>

<p>
<strong>Backup</strong></p>

<p>A business should back up all datafinancial or otherwiseon a regular basis. After you close the yearly books, create a backup and store it in the cloud or in a secure location away from the office.</p>

<p>A hard drive crash or similar disaster could wipe out a year's financial documents, information that the IRS will still expect you to produce.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tax software and payroll programs simplify a small business' relationship with the IRS. The les time you spend preparing taxes, the more time you have to run your small business.</p></blockquote>

<div></div>

<div>Whether a small business owner chooses to prepare her own taxes or enlists the aid of a tax professional is a matter of personal choice. Some people have a gift for numbers, while others prefer the security and guarantees offered by a professional tax accountant.</div>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Tax Preparation Software</strong></p>

<p>If you file your own taxes, you might as well simplify the process as much as possible. 
<a title="tax preparation" href="http://www.staples.com/tax+preparation+software/directory_tax+preparation+software">Tax preparation software</a> for small businesses helps keep your pre-April 15th headaches to a minimum.</p>

<p>Two programs dominate the SBO tax software market: H&amp;amp;R Block at Home Premium and Intuit TurboTax Business. Both programs use a question and answer format to simplify tax preparation as much as possible. Based on your answers to in-program questions, the software performs all necessary calculations and fills in IRS forms for e-filing.</p>

<p>Both software programs allow users to import data. Intuit offers easy import from 
<a title="Quickbooks" href="http://www.staples.com/QuickBooks-Pro-2013-for-Windows-1-User-Boxed/product_957740">QuickBooks</a> files, while H&amp;amp;R Block at Home imports the previous year's tax information from its own system or TurboTax. In case of problems and questions software databases cannot answer, both programs allow users to consult with on-call tax professionals.</p>

<p>
<strong>Accounting with Quicken</strong></p>

<p>Staying organized throughout the year makes tax preparation much easier  ask any accountant who's had to deal with a shoebox full of receipts. While a number of accounting and budgeting programs exist, Quicken is a standard for many businesses.</p>

<p>Quicken's success lies in its versatility. A small business owner can organize multiple accounts, track expenses, isolate tax-deductible expenses and calculate payroll taxes, all from Quicken.</p>

<p>Intuit offers an online payroll service in conjunction with Quicken. In addition to simplifying employee and contractor payments, the service automatically calculates payroll tax deductions, and allows users to withhold payroll tax deductions, which are paid and filed electronically though the service.</p>

<p>
<strong>Financial Apps</strong></p>

<p>While not tax preparation software, small business smartphone apps help business owners track expenses, calculate taxes for invoices and, when necessary, find professional tax assistance.</p>

<p>Expense apps such as Expensify and BizXpense Tracker simplify the onerous task of saving expense receipts. Instead, just take a picture of your receipt with your smartphone. The apps store the receipt photos, and, in the case of Expensify, convert receipt information into an easy-to-read report.</p>

<p>Billings Touch is another helpful app with taxation applications. A time tracker and invoice app, Billings Touch calculates necessary invoice tax, including international taxes.</p>

<p>Sometimes, no matter how savvy your accounting skills, you need the advice of a professional tax accountant. The Teaspiller app matches up small business owners and tax professionals based on the nature of the small business. The app also allows you to get a quote before engaging a tax professional's services.</p>

<title>Receipts to Refunds: Small Business Bookkeeping Best Practices</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Bookkeeping is a fact of business life. But it's not just a good habit; it's also a necessity for paying your taxes properly and getting loans from banks.</p></blockquote>

<div>

<p>Following a few simple guidelines for bookkeeping can help you grow your business  and steer clear of financial and legal trouble.</p>

<p>
<strong>Document Expenses</strong></p>

<p>Any money you spend on behalf of your business should be recorded somehow, whether in a journal, a ledger or bookkeeping software. Categorizing each entry will help you determine how you're spending your money over time. Most software provides a selection of categories and even lets you specify your own.</p>

<p>Provided it is used solely for business, a credit or debit card is a good basic way to track expenses. In fact, your monthly statement is a record in itself.</p>

<p>If you do use cash, be diligent about recording that too. And even after you've documented all outgoing money, be sure to save those receipts so you'll have backup for an accountant (or the IRS) to review.</p>

<p>
<strong>Stay On Top of Receivables</strong></p>

<p>Late payments from customers can really hurt your cash flow. It's important to maintain good relations with clients, but it can't be at the expense of your business. Have a process in place for payments that are 30, 60 or 90 days late, including follow-up notices and late fees.</p>

<p>If you use invoices, make the most of them by organizing them in a way that's easy to track. File multiple copies, by customer name and by number. Again, software can help you track past-due payments, and some banks offer invoicing solutions as part of their business services.</p>

<p>
<strong>Get Professional Help</strong></p>

<p>If you can possibly afford it, having an experienced accountant look over your records at least quarterly is money well-spent. Besides freeing up a little of your time, it can also reduce the likelihood of errors.</p>

<p>Having accounting backup is no substitute for solid recordkeeping, though. Your accountant will be better able to help you (and give you better service for your money) if he or she has good information from you. This means you can't just hand over a box of receipts or wait until the week before taxes are due to get your books in order.</p>

<p>If you use bookkeeping software, see what software your accountant uses. Being able to exchange compatible electronic files can speed things up, especially during tax season.</p>

<p>
<strong>Plan, Plan, Plan</strong></p>

<p>Always be thinking about upcoming expenses. This means tracking regular events like tax deadlines and, ideally, setting aside money for unforeseen events such as equipment repair or replacement.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, try to devote a little time to keeping your accounting records up to date. It can save you a lot of headaches when the crunch of a tax deadline or loan application arises.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You've had a bank account for years. You can balance your checkbook, apply for a mortgage and manage your budget. Your business, however, has different banking needs. Learn about the important aspects of small business banking.</p></blockquote>

<div></div>

<div>Most personal banking doesn't require much strategy. People can usually get by with a checking/savings account combo and an extensive ATM network.</div>

<div>

<p>But when it comes to your business, you're going to need more. Here's a look at the features and issues you should be thinking about.</p>

<p>
<strong>Small Business Accounts</strong></p>

<p>For bookkeeping and tax purposes, keeping your business and personal finances segregated is a must. Almost any bank will open a business checking or savings account for you, but they will want some details first. Does your business have a name? Have you registered that name with the state? Make sure you have this information in hand.</p>

<p>Pay close attention to fees. Many banks charge higher fees to businesses than to individuals. Is there a minimum balance requirement? A maximum number of checks you can write each month? Be sure to ask about all charges and restrictions upfront, before opening an account.</p>

<p>
<strong>Banking Services</strong></p>

<p>Banks are more than just a place to park money. Many offer business services such as investment consulting, payroll, cash management and online banking. What might this mean for you? Here's one example: If you handle invoicing, consider what you'd be willing to pay to automate the task. Then, shop around for a bank that provides those tools. If the tools are convenient and the price is right, you're a step closer to selecting a bank based on service.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Bank You'll Need Tomorrow</strong></p>

<p>Think about the future banking needs of your business. For example, you may only deal in cash payments today, but the time may come when your customers demand the convenience of credit card payment. To accept credit cards, you'll need a merchant account; if your bank has offered them all along, it will be much easier to set up that account.</p>

<p>Similarly, even if you don't need a business loan now, having an established relationship with a bank will help you start that financing conversation when the time comes.</p>

<p>
<strong>Large vs. Small</strong></p>

<p>Although big banks have gotten a bad rap in recent years, the wide range of products and services they offer can make them convenient one-stop shops for small businesses. One thing they aren't known for, however, is flexibility. If you need some wiggle room on fees, interest rates or payment schedules (as small business people often do), you're unlikely to find anyone at a large bank with the authority to negotiate with you.</p>

<p>Smaller banks are often sensitive to economic conditions in their communities. In general, they can understand the pressures on your particular business better than large national banks. And if you require face-to-face service from a bank officer with the authority to help you out in tough situations, you're much more likely to find that at a smaller community institution. Technological advances have also made it possible for modestly sized banks to offer services (like online banking) once available only from large chains.</p>

<title>Small Business Administration Loan Applications Made Easy</title>
<description>Learn how S.B.A loans are a great way to raise capital for your small business.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Thinking of going to the Small Business Administration (SBA) for financing? This article is for you.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the SBA's best-known functions is providing access to capital  something small and beginning businesses often need help with. Starting a new business can be risky, after all, and most bank loan officers don't like risk.</p>

<div>

<p>To be clear, the SBA doesn't actually make loans; it guarantees loans made by banks. When people say "SBA loan," they're referring to a bank loan backed in part by the SBA.</p>

<p>The idea is that banks will be more willing to help finance small, often untested businesses if they can recover at least a portion of the loan in the event of default. Many banks, large and small, participate in SBA loan programs; chances are there's at least one in your area.</p>

<p>The SBA offers several loan programs. Which loan is appropriate for you will depend on the type and circumstances of your business. Here are a few of the most common programs.</p>

<p>
<strong>7(a) Loan</strong></p>

<p>Named for Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act, this is the most basic and popular SBA loan. Financing can be guaranteed for a variety of general business purposes, including working capital, machinery and equipment, furniture and more.</p>

<p>
<strong>CDC/504 Loan</strong></p>

<p>This program is a long-term financing tool, providing small businesses with fixed-rate financing to acquire major fixed assets (including real estate) for expansion or modernization. Intended to foster economic development in a community, CDC/504 loans are used in combination with traditional bank loans and equity provided by the borrower. (CDC stands for Certified Development Company, the nonprofit entity that is certified and regulated by the SBA and facilitates these types of loans.)</p>

<p>
<strong>Microloan</strong></p>

<p>This is a small, short-term loan (with a $50,000 maximum) made available through special intermediary lenders. The intermediaries receive funds from the SBA, and each has its own lending and credit requirements. Typically, they require some type of collateral and a guarantee from the borrower. Intermediaries also provide business training and technical assistance to borrowers. Before receiving a microloan, you may need to complete training or planning requirements.</p>

<p>You can get much more information on SBA loans from a local SBA district office  
<a title="SBA Loan center" href="http://www.sba.gov/about-offices-list/2">find yours here.</a></p>

<p>
<strong>Preparing Your Application</strong></p>

<p>If you decide to apply for an SBA loan, preparing the correct information is critical. Some of the most important documents include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Loan application form (
<a href="http://www.sba.gov/content/application-business-loan">SBA Form 4</a>)</li>

<li>Personal background and financial statement (SBA Forms 
<a href="http://www.sba.gov/content/statement-personal-history">912</a> and 
<a href="http://www.sba.gov/content/personal-financial-statement">413</a>)</li>

<li>Business financial statements (current profit-and-loss, and projected income and finances)</li>

<li>Business license or certificate</li>

<li>Personal and business tax returns for past three years</li>

<li>A brief history of the business and how it will be helped by an SBA loan</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="http://www.sba.gov/content/sba-loan-application-checklist">Download a comprehensive checklist</a> of application materials.</p>

<p>The SBA is a great financing resource for small businesses that otherwise might not qualify for loans. Keep in mind, though, that the money will still be coming from a traditional bank or lending institution. Being prepared with the correct information and forms along with a clear business strategy is crucial to get the financing ball rolling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wage earners pay taxes throughout the year, and the IRS expects self-employed individuals to do the same. Learn how to deal with estimated tax payments.</p></blockquote>

<div></div>

<div>Tax time comes once a year, unless you're in business for yourself. Self-employed individuals pay estimated taxes four times a year or risk significant IRS interference.</div>

<div>

<p>
<strong>Who Pays Estimated Tax?</strong></p>

<p>Independent contractors or sole proprietors of businesses must pay estimated taxes. Members of trade or business partnerships also pay quarterly taxes, as do people who make money from investments or similar revenue streams.</p>

<p>
<strong>Estimated Tax and Self-Employment Tax</strong></p>

<p>Estimated tax, as the name implies, refers to the amount of tax you calculate you'll have to pay over the tax year, paid in four installments.</p>

<p>In addition to regular tax, self-employed individuals pay self-employment tax. Self-employment tax refers to Social Security and Medicare tax similar in amount to tax withheld from wage earners.</p>

<p>Four times a year self-employed individuals fill out a 
<a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf">1040-ES</a> (Estimated Tax for Individuals) and submit the form with payment to the IRS. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/tax+software/directory_tax+software">Tax software</a> helps you calculate your estimated earnings.</p>

<p>
<strong>Can't I Wait to Pay Until Tax Time?</strong></p>

<p>Not a good idea. The IRS likes to get its tax payments throughout the year from both wage earners and the self-employed. You must pay estimated tax on time if both the following conditions apply:</p>

<ul>

<li>You expect to owe at least $1,000 in taxes for the year after subtracting withholding and refundable credits.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>You expect your withholding or refundable credits will be less than 90 percent of the taxes estimated for the current year's tax return or less than 100 percent of the tax shown on last year's tax return (the smaller of these two amounts applies).</li>
</ul>

<p>The IRS doesnt want you to spend their money before you submit your annual tax return. Failing to submit estimated taxes on time can result in penalties if you wind up owing on your annual tax return.
<strong> </strong></p>

<p>
<strong>Estimated Tax Deadlines</strong></p>

<p>Estimated tax deadlines are the 15th of April, June, September and January. If the due date falls on a holiday or weekend, payments are due on the next business day and processed based on the payments postmarked dates.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tips for Paying Estimated Tax</strong></p>

<p>Remember your estimated taxes will change based on your income for each pay period. If your revenues fluctuate during the year you may need to pay estimated taxes on some periods but not on others.</p>

<p>While you can submit your 1040-ES and payment by mail, using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System is more effective and ensures payments arrive on time.</p>

<p>If your income is relatively stable, consider making monthly payments instead of quarterly. Monthly payments are smaller and more manageable. Track all estimated tax payments for use with your annual tax return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have a great idea that might benefit from a direct appeal to the masses? Check out this handy guide to raising capital via crowdfunding, including the pros and cons.</p></blockquote>

<div>

<p>Let's say you have a great idea for a product or service, but would rather not beg for startup cash from the venture capitalist world. Crowdfunding may be just what you're looking for.</p>

<p>This popular means of raising capital lets you take your idea directly to the masses. People can vote with their pocketbooks, infusing the project with cash in exchange for a reward of your choosing. In this article, we'll walk you through the basics of crowdfunding and teach you how to do it right.
<strong> </strong></p>

<p>
<strong>The Definition</strong></p>

<p>Crowdfunding means, unsurprisingly, seeking funding from the crowd in the form of small donations or investments. Unlike venture capital or angel investing, crowdfunding is a democratic process  your big idea might net 1,000 or even 10,000 "investors," each of whom spends a few bucks on the cause. They typically do this through websites designed to make the process easy and transparent.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Players</strong></p>

<p>You may have heard of 
<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, but how about 
<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/">Indiegogo</a> or 
<a href="http://www.razoo.com/">Razoo</a>? These are the Big Three of crowdfunding at the moment, and each approaches the challenge a bit differently:</p>

<ul>

<li>Kickstarter mandates that every project has a threshold  fail to meet your funding quota, and no money changes hands.</li>

<li>Indiegogo is more flexible, letting you choose whether you want to use a threshold or simply take whatever people pledge.</li>

<li>Razoo is quite different, giving startups and inventors the tools to create "fundraising widgets," or small website badges, that can accept pledges wherever they appear.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>The Pitch</strong></p>

<p>So how can you get the word out and find those investors quickly? It helps to have a great hook, of course  ideally something you can describe in just a few words. Videos are another proven funding tool: A nice promotional ad can go a long way toward convincing the masses of your project's merits.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to publicize across every channel and network you know. Sometimes it takes a lot of sweat to make an idea "go viral."</p>

<p>
<strong>The Pros and Cons</strong></p>

<p>So why would you choose this completely unorthodox approach to startup cash? The pros are enticing: You can earn instant cash and get some free marketing through the campaign itself, and your investors are likely to become customers and evangelists for you.</p>

<p>But there are cons as well. Crowdfunding can't provide a steady revenue stream, and you can't access the kind of expert business advice you might get from a more experienced investor. One last scary thought: In the world of crowdfunding, you live and die publicly, so don't attempt this unless you have a fairly high tolerance for embarrassment.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Wisdom of Crowds</strong></p>

<p>If you have an idea that doesn't fit any existing niche or industry, crowdfunding is a low-stakes approach that may offer what you need. But be sure you read the fine print on any campaign website and prepare to follow through as promised. If you aren't ready to launch at the designated time, you may see that friendly crowd turn into an angry mob.</p>

<title>A Checklist for Effective Business Plan Presentation Design</title>
<description>When writing your business plan, it's helpful to think about how the information can be presented visually.</description>

<em>When writing your business plan, it's a good idea to think about how the information can be presented visually. Get useful tips here. </em></p>

<p>In writing a business plan, the amount of information you need to gather and articulate can seem overwhelming. But creating a presentation of the material can help you focus, even if you don't end up in front of an audience.</p>

<p>Here are some insights on how to design a business plan presentation that stands out.</p>

<h2>Key Elements</h2>

<p>Every business plan will have unique characteristics, since every company is different. However, you should always include elements like these:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Company purpose: </strong>This should be a one-sentence declarative statement; often, it's the same as the mission statement.</li>

<li>
<strong>Reason for launch: </strong>Have you seen a spot in the marketplace for your product or service? Is there a customer need that's not being met? Address how your company will fill that gap.</li>

<li>
<strong>Market information:</strong> Identify the customers you intend to attract and where they can be found demographically and geographically.</li>

<li>
<strong>Competitor data: </strong>Be frank about the leaders in your space and what they offer. How will your company provide what they don't?</li>

<li>
<strong>Product or service: </strong>Go into detail about what you'll offer, including a development roadmap for future features.</li>

<li>
<strong>Business model:</strong>
<em> </em>Dig into your financials, including potential pricing, revenue model, distribution, sales and marketing and any projections in a five-year timeframe.</li>

<li>
<strong>Company makeup: </strong>Describe the background and experience of your company founders and team members.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Layout and Presentation Tips</h2>

<p>When designing a layout for your presentation, follow some general rules:</p>

<ul>

<li>Limit the number of words on each slide, and make sure graphs and charts are easy to read. You don't want to put up a wall of information that detracts from what you're saying.</li>

<li>Provide a handout of the presentation so your audience can jot notes more easily.</li>

<li>Set a limit of 15 to 20 slides. With material as complex as a business plan, it can be very difficult to keep an audience engaged during a 40-slide presentation.</li>

<li>Use attractive graphics and color, without taking away from the text.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Audience Participation</h2>

<p>Although a business plan prepared for a presentation will share some similarities with a written plan, there are some distinctive aspects to consider when an audience is involved. Here are some tips on how to make the most of their time:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Address questions after each key element is presented.</strong> That way, you can help shape later parts of the presentation if necessary. For example, if questions early in the presentation all pertain to potential growth, you can present later material with a perspective on possible market expansion plans.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Set a time limit.</strong> Unless your audience agrees in advance to an open-ended meeting, it's better to determine a "hard stop" and mention that timeframe when you get started. Audience members will appreciate this respect for their time. At the end, you can offer to address additional questions then or at another meeting if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Start on time.</strong> In the same way that a hard stop shows respect for the audience's schedules, beginning on time says a great deal about how you run your company: professionally, and with consideration for others.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a strong presentation style, well-designed slides and concise information about your company, your business plan will be ready to make its public debut.</p>

<title>Perfecting Your Small Business Elevator Pitch</title>

<p>
<em>Can you sell someone on your business in 60 seconds or less? Making sure your elevator pitch is perfect might come in handy when a potential client or investor is short on time.</em></p>

<p>You have one minute to tell potential clients or investors everything about your business and leave them feeling enthusiastic and intrigued. Go.</p>

<p>That might sound daunting, but perfecting the "elevator pitch" can be a crucial part of your business. At any business-related event (and sometimes even in an actual elevator), you may be called on to give a brief description of your company and value proposition. Here are some tips on making that minute (or less) count.</p>

<p>
<strong>Keep it short, and then cut it in half.</strong>
<em> </em>Take some time to describe your company, what it has to offer and why the listener should care. Most likely, it takes a few minutes to cover that information  but a solid elevator pitch should be only 30 to 60 seconds.</p>

<p>
<strong>Watch your language.</strong>
<em> </em>Be clear and articulate, without using jargon or buzzwords. Your listener is ready for powerful, concise language, not marketing speak that might be vague and unhelpful.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tell a story.</strong>
<em> </em>If possible, throw in a shortened version of a typical customer problem and how you can solve it.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tweak the content for your audience.</strong> Some companies do well by having several different pitches. Have a general one handy, but also one for potential clients or customers, one for possible investors and one for potential recruits. Each pitch should emphasize an aspect of the company that the audience will find particularly compelling (e.g., a pitch for investors could reference how you stand out from your competition).</p>

<p>
<strong>Practice the pitch.</strong>
<em> </em>When delivering the information, you don't want to seem overly rehearsed. At the same time, sentences and ideas should flow smoothly. Ask friends, family members and colleagues to listen to different versions and give candid feedback on what works and what doesn't. Also, record the pitch and listen to it yourself; imagine you're a customer or investor and consider what would catch your attention.</p>

<p>
<strong>Watch your audience.</strong> Most likely, you'll see when someone's attention begins to wander. Note the moment in your pitch when this happens, and adjust that part for the next time.</p>

<p>
<strong>Know your goal.</strong>
<em> </em>Above all, understand why you're talking about the company. If it's to earn a referral, get startup funding or enlist a new prospect, focus all your energy toward that objective.</p>

<p>You never know when you'll need to deliver the perfect elevator pitch. Make sure you're ready to shine, no matter when the opportunity arises.</p>

<title>You're in Command: The Live Small Business Seminar</title>

<p>
<em>Want to host a seminar that informs, delights and sells? Check out this handy guide for tips and tricks.</em></p>

<p>The live seminar is a tried-and-true business tool used for education, outreach and sales. Unlike its online cousin, the webinar, a seminar is a truly personal experience shared with actual human beings. It requires a specific set of skills and tools, such as effective public speaking, a great presentation style and a compelling argument.</p>

<p>If you'd like to make the leap from podium-based voice to presentation ninja, follow these handy tips.</p>

<h2>Pick a Great Topic</h2>

<p>A seminar is only as effective as the people it reaches, so attendance is essential. The surest way to boost your numbers and reach a broader audience is to pick a topic that will put bodies in the seats.</p>

<p>Think about the problems and needs your target audience faces, and design a seminar to meet these head on. Give your seminar a compelling title and a great hook  something that implies usefulness and is easily digestible. Then focus all your energy on providing significant value to your attendees, so they come away with both new knowledge and a desire to pay for even more.</p>

<h2>Nail the Issue</h2>

<p>Once you have the topic in hand, it's time to start organizing the seminar itself. A great small business seminar usually starts by identifying a problem, such as something that affects the revenue, growth or productivity of your audience.</p>

<p>But it's not enough to simply name this problem; you have to show that you get it. Pull together anecdotes, stories, graphics and numbers to crystallize and distill the problem in familiar terms. And don't be afraid to inject some personality into this section  commiseration and humor go a long way toward connecting with your audience.</p>

<h2>Find the Solution</h2>

<p>Now it's your time to answer the burning question you've raised: How did you solve this problem? How can they do the same thing? Seminars succeed or fail based on the expertise of the speaker; this is your chance to shine.</p>

<p>A great seminar goes beyond simply identifying the issue. It also takes the audience through a step-by-step process to show exactly how the problem was solved. It proves the point with hard data or studies. And it leaves no lingering doubt that your answer is the way to go. This is the meat of your presentation  and the section that will bring your audience back for a second visit.</p>

<h2>Call to Action</h2>

<p>Seminars are selling tools at heart. You may be a nice guy who derives pleasure from sharing his knowledge with the world, but ultimately the purpose of any seminar is to get your audience to sign up for future products or services.</p>

<p>Adding a call to action at the end of your seminar is your way into this process: a direct appeal for everyone to sign on the dotted line. The call to action is an art form, like any sales pitch; you want to be persuasive without sounding desperate or cloying. One way to do this is to strike a balance between knowledge imparted and knowledge promised. Sure, the audience learned a lot today, but there's even more available  for a fee.</p>

<h2>Use the Medium</h2>

<p>One way to enhance a live seminar is to use the tools at your disposal. Most of these presentations include a slide show or PowerPoint presentation. The more care you put into choosing, designing and ordering these images, the more convincing you will be.</p>

<p>Consider the progression of your argument from 10,000 feet: Does it track? Is it compelling? Interesting? Do the graphics and images you've chosen underscore your script or detract from it? Aim for strong synergy between your speech and the memorable media you choose to make a lasting impression.</p>

<h2>Be Present</h2>

<p>But don't forget you're in the room. There's a danger of losing yourself in the script and the materials, of getting so lost in the details that you forget where you are.</p>

<p>Live seminars can be spontaneous and electric in the right hands. Stay attuned to your audience, watch for questions and "work the room" whenever possible. Don't hide behind the podium; some of the most effective public speakers are the ones who create a sense of intimacy even in a packed auditorium, connecting with audience members organically and to great effect.</p>

<h2>Finish Strong</h2>

<p>No seminar is complete without a live exchange or two. Consider sticking around for a Q&amp;amp;A when you're done. This is your chance to show your nimble mind and speak off the cuff, impressing the hordes with your knowledge and charm.</p>

<p>Practice this. Anticipate some of the most common questions, and prepare brief and concise answers. Try to get comfortable with extemporaneous speaking, and steel yourself for the obligatory skeptic or two who dares to question your hard-won knowledge. Remember that answering questions effectively is a great way to network and sell your brand.</p>

<h2>Keep Trying</h2>

<p>Designing and executing a live seminar may feel like a monumental task, but it gets easier as you go. Every great public speaker was probably a horrible public speaker at some point, so be patient with yourself and learn from your mistakes. Attend other seminars and poll your colleagues about the speeches and presentations that they particularly admire. Practice your delivery in front of friends and strangers.</p>

<p>With a little luck and a lot of practice, you could be on your way to a life of exorbitant speaking fees. Or, at the very least, an ever-growing network of customers and partners.</p>

<title>Windows 8 and Office 15: Better Together</title>
<description>Windows 8 is here and Office 15 is one its way. Should small business owners upgrade immediately?</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>
<em>Windows 8 is here and Office 15 is one its way. Should small business owners upgrade immediately?</em></p>

<p>When Microsoft announced Windows 8's launch in 2012, industry analysts assumed the new operating system would pave the way for the next iteration of Office. The "one-two" punch of new OS and Office editions is an established part of Microsoft's business plan. Sure enough, the company plans to launch Office 2013 (also known as Office 15) shortly after the Windows 8 launch, which took place on October 26, 2012.</p>

<p>Every upgrade of Windows and Office leaves small businesses asking the same question: Should we upgrade now or later? After all, Windows 7 works well enough for business use, and employees are comfortable with Office 2010's features. On the other hand, Office is the productivity suite of choice for most of the business world.</p>

<h2>Windows 8 and RT</h2>

<p>Windows 8 and Office 15 were, of course, designed to complement each other, and they do so very well. The new operating system offers full functionality for touch screens and tablets without sacrificing PC-friendly features, and it succeeds admirably. The operating system allows users to share settings, preferences and files among multiple devices by logging into a Microsoft account.</p>

<p>Windows 8 comes in three forms. Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro are designed for use with PCs for consumers and business users, respectively. Windows RT is the mobile version of the OS, designed to work with the ARM processors and lightweight applications used by most tablets and smartphones.</p>

<p>In a major departure from its old business model, Microsoft announced all devices sold with Windows RT would have a special RT-compatible version of Office 15 preinstalled. Devices using Windows 8, however, will not include Office.</p>

<p>Office 15 will be available as a cloud-based "Office 365" subscription service. Instead of purchasing the productivity suite on disc, users will buy an activation code and download Office software, which will automatically install upgrades for the duration of the subscription. Each authorized user can install the software on five different devices.</p>

<h2>Soaring into the Clouds</h2>

<p>Unlike previous editions, Office 15 saves documents to the cloud by default, specifically saving files to Microsoft's SkyDrive online backup and recovery service. Hitting the Save button results in a progress bar that confirms the file was stored to the cloud. You can still save files to your computer if you choose.</p>

<p>Like Windows 8, Office 15 connects to the cloud through the user's Microsoft ID. No matter what Office application you use, your name and Microsoft ID image appear in the upper right-hand corner, much like they would if you used a program like Google Gmail or even Facebook.</p>

<p>Constant connectivity to the cloud allows users to move seamlessly from one device to another. The files and settings you create on your computer will be immediately available when you switch to your tablet. Open a file created on a different device and Office 15 will even remember the location of your cursor in the document.</p>

<h2>Collaborative Features</h2>

<p>The ability to share settings and files between your PC and mobile devices is a great productivity tool, but Office 15's cloud-based service also encourages online collaboration around the workplace or even around the country (or world!). Any file stored on SkyDrive can be shared by emailing the file's URL to colleagues. Even if the other person doesn't use a Windows OS, he or she can view the file through a web browser.</p>

<p>Sending the URL alone does not give users authority to edit or make changes to a file. The file creator grants editing privileges by selecting "Invite People" from the File menu.</p>

<p>With Office 15, Microsoft finally realized that Word's Track Changes feature needed an update. In earlier versions of Word, editing changes could quickly turn a document into an unreadable mass of red and blue edits. Each comment on an edit received its own comment bubble, further cluttering up the page.</p>

<p>Office 15 solves these problems handily (and a good thing too, given the suite's focus on online collaboration). All tracked changes show up as a red underline. Clicking the line expands the changes if you need to examine the edited content. In addition, all comments on an individual edit are logged in the same comment bubble, making it much easier to follow the conversation.</p>

<p>While we're discussing improvements in Office's editing features, let's not overlook one small but important change: Word now supports PDF editing. You can open and edit PDF files in Word, and then choose to save them as either Word docs or PDFs.</p>

<h2>Tablet Changes</h2>

<p>Office 15 provides viewing options that indicate Microsoft understands the inherent differences between desktop and tablet use. In touch screen mode, the spaces between objects in a document widen slightly, and the menus flatten out. This mode doesnt make the text larger, but makes it easier to select and swipe icons, text or other objects without hitting the wrong item.</p>

<p>In addition, a document's View options now include a read-only mode, transforming the document into a full-screen mode similar to an eBook, allowing users to swipe pages from left to right, rather than up and down.</p>

<p>Tablets are increasingly the device of choice for making PowerPoint presentations due to their portability. Connect a projector to a Windows 8 computer and Windows automatically directs your desktop to the larger screen (a blessing for all of us who have delayed important presentations fighting with monitor settings).</p>

<p>During a presentation, Office 15 users can access a Presenter View window that only appears on the device desktop, and not on the projected presentation. This window shows important information such as the time elapsed during the presentation, and allows users to take notes hidden from presentation viewers. Tapping the tablet screen with the stylus to point out aspects of the presentation produces an effect on the projected image similar to a laser pointer.</p>

<h2>Nifty Extras</h2>

<p>Overall, Office 15 streamlines and improves on previous editions without radically altering the style and function of the applications. If you adapted well to Office 2010, you wont have much difficulty mastering Office 15.</p>

<p>Many of the changes are small tweaks to existing features, or new features that make the apps more organic and cloud friendly. For instance, Word now supports insertion of YouTube videos directly into documents. As you resize and move the video window--or indeed any embedded object--the surrounding text automatically readjusts to wrap around the video.</p>

<p>Word also now integrates with Facebook and Flickr accounts, so images on these services can be captured and inserted into documents. All Office apps also have an Apps for Office feature, making it possible to embed apps directly into documents for interactive purposes.</p>

<h2>A Solution to BYOD?</h2>

<p>The increase in Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies for mobile devices has left many IT departments struggling to maintain network security for radically different devices. Windows 8 and Office 15 offer a solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Windows produces security patches quickly and effectively. If businesses running Windows 8 insist that BYOD devices also run up-to-date Windows 8 or RT, security settings will be stronger than if one employee uses an iPad, one an Android tablet and so on.</p>

<p>So, should you upgrade to Windows 8 and Office 15? You might be able to continue using last generation apps, but you'll be operating at a disadvantage. Office 15's cloud storage and collaborative features offer productivity solutions that you cant afford to ignore.</p>

<title>The Well-Crafted White Paper</title>
<description>Learn how to put together a compelling and effective White paper for any product or business with this quick guide.</description>

<p>
<em>Learn how to put together a compelling and effective White paper for any product or business with this quick guide.</em></p>

<p>White papers are a great way to educate your clients and sell your product at the same time. More detailed and technical than the typical brochure, a white paper lets you do a "deep dive" into your product and explore the problems it was built to solve.</p>

<p>Think of the white paper as your chance to stretch your legs, teach your clients something useful and build a persuasive case point by point.</p>

<h2>Identify Your Goals</h2>

<p>Step one for any white paper is to think about your goals: What do you want the document to 
<em>do</em>? Most white papers are written to generate sales, but some are published simply as free "research" designed to demonstrate leadership in the field.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this guide, let's assume you want to generate sales. The next question is: Who's your audience?
<strong>                                   </strong></p>

<h2>Target the Right Audience</h2>

<p>Consider how different audiences receive information. Executives who are in a hurry might just want a quick overview and a few salient points about the product  no jargon, no nonsense. Sales associates who are more accustomed to the language of marketing might respond better to statistics about efficiency, ROI and the like. Technical audiences tend to prefer very specific and detailed information about functions, algorithms and the engineering firepower behind what you've created.</p>

<p>In other words, every audience speaks its own language. The more skillfully you can tap into the lexicon of your client's concerns and needs, the more effective your white paper will be.</p>

<h2>Identify the Issue</h2>

<p>White papers are most persuasive when they can "set the table" by correctly identifying a problem that needs solving. This problem could be almost anything: a production shortfall, a pain point in your customer service, a speed bump in your sales funnel.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, a good white paper opens with a lucid description of the issue, supported by concrete facts and figures. Solid research can go a long way toward establishing credibility in the eyes of your audience, and keeping those eyes glued to the page.</p>

<h2>Describe the Ideal Solution</h2>

<p>The next section is a chance to lay the groundwork for your upcoming product description. Because white papers aren't typically "salesy" in tone, one of the smartest ways to avoid the appearance of naked marketing is to include this section describing what an ideal solution might look like.</p>

<p>Think of it as a thought experiment that derives the best possible answer  what might a perfect solution do, and what features should it have? This process demonstrates your intelligence and gives your readers a sense of ownership over the solution to come.</p>

<h2>Describe Your Solution</h2>

<p>Now, if you've designed your argument right, it's time for the big unveiling: how your product will solve the customer's problems. This is your chance to explore the many features and benefits of your product in depth; a typical white paper may include anywhere from three to several dozen pages of product information.</p>

<p>Once again, remember to consider your audience here: Executives want details, sales associates need numbers, technical contacts like data. Be sure to focus on benefits over features. Stay inside the mind of your reader and track the accumulation of information from his or her perspective. That is, address questions as they arise, develop a cogent throughline and don't assume knowledge unless the answer is universally known.</p>

<h2>Enhancements Count</h2>

<p>Although these documents are called white papers, some color is often allowed, and even encouraged. Charts and graphs can be a great supplement to your white paper as long as they're clear and to the point.</p>

<p>A good white paper can double as a valuable research tool, giving your clients a dose of highly relevant information in an easily consumable format. Sales figures, customer habits, financial trends  these are just a few of the concepts that might benefit from a clean visual aid. One word of warning, however: Stick with professional designers on these. Primitive pie charts and bitmapped bar graphs will only diminish your standing as an authority.</p>

<h2>A Final Word on Abstracts</h2>

<p>One final question you may have is whether to include an abstract, or brief summary, at the start of your white paper. There's some disagreement about whether it's desirable or even necessary to include one, especially for shorter documents.</p>

<p>Our feeling is that the abstract exists for one purpose: to make people read what's inside. If it doesn't help your cause in this way, or you think your audience will read the entire paper without any prodding, go ahead and scrap it. But for most audiences, an abstract is a good way to slip in a quick "elevator pitch" and cultivate some interest in the topic.</p>

<h2>Write and Rewrite</h2>

<p>In the right hands, a white paper should be an evergreen document that may be used and referenced for a long time. It demands the same high standard of fluency and skill as a doctoral thesis or a grant proposal. Every word counts, and each point should follow logically from the one before.</p>

<p>It may even help to think of your paper in narrative terms: You're telling a story. Not a literal story, of course, but an argument that generates questions and builds an organic flow from problem to solution. By working with a professional on your white paper and choosing substance over marketing bombast, you should end up with a truly compelling marketing tool.</p>

<em>A host of software and apps help businesses connect with remote employees and branch offices. We've collected some of the best collaborative apps available.</em></p>

<p>Not so long ago, a small business could only attract and work with local talent. Working in real-time with a designer in New York, a web content writer in South Carolina and a translator in Tokyo presented insurmountable difficulties.</p>

<p>With today's host of collaborative apps and software solutions, long-distance work relationships are increasingly common. The modern small business may include telecommuting employees or operate as a Results-Oriented Work Environment (ROWE), allowing employees to determine their own work locations. Here's a selection of collaboration tools that help remote workers work as a team.</p>

<h2>Google Docs and Calendars</h2>

<p>Google Docs is a cloud-based software suite that includes a spreadsheet application and word processor. Up to fifty people can edit a spreadsheet simultaneously, communicating through a built-in chat system. Word processing documents support up to ten simultaneous users. Google Doc users share files by emailing document links to co-workers.</p>

<p>Work schedules, meetings, and deadlines can all be shared through a multi-person Google calendar, which syncs easily with mobile devices, smartphones and desktop calendars.</p>

<h2>Drop it in DropBox</h2>

<p>DropBox dispenses with the need to send large files as email attachments. Users simply drag a file into a folder on the desktop app and DropBox automatically shares it with all users who have access to the folder. The app offers 2 GB free, and paying subscribers can access up to a terabyte of storage space.</p>

<h2>Skype and Video Meetings</h2>

<p>Chat, email and text messages may all transmit information, but nothing facilitates communication faster than a face-to-face meeting. Skype provides free one-on-one video chat, or you can pay a small monthly fee for group video calling. Conducting meetings on Skype helps forge a sense of team identity and allows for fast information exchanges.</p>

<h2>Basecamp</h2>

<p>Basecamp is a no-frills collaborative tool for project management. The app includes to-do lists, a calendar, and "Writeboards" for collaborative document editing. Comments left on a project are automatically emailed to other members of the team, and project supervisors can determine who has access to each file.</p>

<p>Basecamp isn't pretty, but it works. It takes a little time to learn how to navigate Basecamp, but once you're familiar with the system, the cloud-based service offers better functionality than more feature-heavy collaborative apps.</p>

<h2>Scribbling with Scribblar</h2>

<p>Scribblar is a free app that acts as a virtual whiteboard. Multiple users can view and alter the whiteboard, as well as upload images. The app also has video chat capabilities, and works well for online brainstorming sessions.</p>

<h2>Go Mobile with Glide</h2>

<p>With mobile devices, coworkers are no longer tied to one location. Glide is a collaborative tool designed for tablets and smartphones. The free version of Glide lets six people collaborate on projects and offers 30 GB of storage. Paying for the service increases the user limit to 25, and ups the storage limit to 250 GB. Glide includes a word processor, spreadsheet editor, image editor, calendar and email system. The app itself is easy to navigate, with features very similar to a traditional PC desktop.</p>

<h2>Introducing Collaborative Tools to Your Staff</h2>

<p>You may wish to have some company policies in place to support app use and protect yourself. For instance, you may want to forbid accessing Google Docs through unsecured public Wi-Fi access to prevent unwanted snooping. Skype users should have dedicated work accounts separate from personal Skype accounts, to prevent work interruptions from family and friends.</p>

<p>Despite the impressive functionality of these apps, they remain nothing more than tools. Using the apps themselves won't spontaneously improve your team's ability to collaborate.</p>

<p>Rather than overwhelm staff with a flood of new collaborative apps, introduce the apps slowly, allowing your team time to explore their new tools and become comfortable with them. Explain the benefits of each app, and employees will be more likely to adopt the new tools.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tired of your PC mouse? Want to try something different? Mice come in an amazing variety of types and styles!</p></blockquote>

<p>When it comes to the computer mouse, many people are perfectly content to use whichever model came with their PC. After all, they may think, mice are pretty much all the same, and this one comes at the right price: free.</p>

<p>These folks may be surprised to know, however, just how many kinds of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Mice-Mice-Keyboards-Speakers/cat_DP1925">PC mice</a> there are. These days, you have a wide range of choices, each with its own benefits and possible drawbacks. There are even a whole host of alternatives to the traditional mouse for those who might want, or need, something a bit different.</p>

<h2>The Wired vs. Wireless Mouse</h2>

<p>In the new millennium, everybody is thinking wireless. We want wireless phones, wireless computers and even wireless DVD players. And when it comes to the PC mouse, wireless appears to be catching on as well. After all, if you can navigate your computer screen unencumbered by messy and annoying cables, why would you choose anything else?</p>

<p>But although the wireless mouse has its advantages, not everyone thinks its the best choice. In fact, some will argue passionately for the speed and reliability of the wired mouse.</p>

<p>Starting with the newcomerthe wireless mousewe all understand how nice it can be to move your mouse whenever and wherever you want. Such a feature gives us the flexibility and freedom todays busy worker often requires. As our workflow and projects change, we can move our mouse around our desk, and around those ever-growing piles of papers, as needed.</p>

<p>Whats more, with all the many wires and cables the typical small business desktop is already buried under, the wireless mouse really helps to clean things up. You wont be dragging your mouse wire around and through your phone and monitor cables or tangling it among your keyboard and pencil sharpener cords. Some wireless mouse models even operate on soft surfaces like your lap or a coffee shop couch, making it a great choice for the mobile worker.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the wired mouse never needs new batteries or recharging. Also, many people believe there is a slight delay between mouse movement and onscreen response with the wireless mouse, something that does not occur with the wired variety. This seems especially the case for those who use their mouse for gaming, but this might be a factor in the busy office as well, especially if there are a lot of wireless signals that might cause interference.</p>

<p>And even though the wireless mouse is unencumbered with a cord, the batteries it contains can add an extra weight. This additional ounce or two might not seem like much, but after 40+ hours of pushing it around each week, your wrist and hand might disagree.</p>

<h2>The Ergonomic vs. Traditional Mouse</h2>

<p>In the effort to combat repetitive motion injuries, an all too common condition for the modern PC user, many computer accessory makers offer specially designed mice that conform more accurately to the shape of a users hand. These mice are made so that your wrist and fingers rest more easily on the mouse, supporting the movements of your hand as you work. Such designs put less strain on your joints and bones, helping you to avoid carpal tunnel syndrome and related problems.</p>

<p>In addition, some of the newer PC mouse models are made to be more sensitive to your movements, thus allowing you to create the same onscreen response with less effort. The inertial or gyroscopic mice that are now available dont even require contact with a solid surface. With these mice, slight rotations of your hand create the needed response.</p>

<p>The primary drawback to these ergonomic models is their price, since they tend to be more expensive than the more basic, traditional mouse. Some of these mice may take some getting used to, given their unusual shapes or use patterns. Thus, the day before a major deadline might not be the best time to introduce this kind of mouse into your office.</p>

<h2>Computer Mouse Alternatives</h2>

<p>The choice in computer input devices for the small business doesnt stop with the computer mouse. Other options, with their own advantages, are available, some of which can be useful for those with limited range of motion in the arm or wrist or with other special needs.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>The Trackball. </strong>Before the advent of the modern optical mouse, which uses light beams to track mouse movement, PC mice utilized roller balls to translate hand motions into onscreen responses. The trackball is in essence a roller mouse turned upside down, in which the user manipulates a ball of varying sizes with his or her fingers.
<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The advantage of the trackball is that only the fingers need to move while the hand itself stays at rest, thus reducing the possibility of repetitive strain injuries. Also, those with arthritis or other joint problems may have trouble gripping a mouse, which the trackball does not require. The primary disadvantages are the relatively larger size of the trackball, reducing portability, and the fact that they can be hard for some to adapt to.
<strong> </strong></p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>The Touchpad.</strong> Those folks with laptops are likely already familiar with the touchpad, in which the PC user moves the cursor by sliding his or her fingers across a small pad or plate. These pads are usually built into the laptop, but fans of the touchpad can purchase separate units to plug into desktop PCs. Again, the main advantage is that less motion can be required to operate the touchpad compared with a mouse. In addition, some find the touchpad faster and more responsive. On the other hand, they can be hard for some people to adjust to.
<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>The Digital Tablet. </strong>This input device works like the touchpad except a pen-like pointer is used to push the cursor around rather than your finger. The tablets surface is pressure sensitive so that the harder you press the pen while using certain applications, the heavier the corresponding lines that are produced onscreen. This technology is often favored by artists or designers. As you might expect, these tablets are expensive in comparison with the average mouse.
<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Eye Tracking. </strong>Eye tracking devices use a head-mounted camera to translate the users moving gaze into onscreen cursor response. These devices are designed to assist users with a limited range of movement. As such, they are specialty devices, and as such are not in general business use. In a few years, however, we may see eye-tracking technologies trickle down into the small-business setting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ideal mouse for you? The one that feels best in your hand and works on your desktop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don't battle your software  instead, learn techniques for installations and upgrades, and take control of your technology.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even in our ultra-connected workplaces, boosting productivity can sometimes feel like a battle of user versus technology. If it seems like you're spending more time fighting against machines than making them work for you, it's time to take control.</p>

<p>Taking a moment to learn some key technology skills will pay off in the future, making you more productive as a result. Here are some top-level tips.</p>

<h2>Operating System Know-How</h2>

<p>For some, a computer's operating system (OS) is a mysterious, dangerous place where things can go very wrong. But getting to know the system through some strategic installations and upgrades can help you gain confidence and increase your tech knowledge.</p>

<p>
<em>Download and Install a Windows OS</em></p>

<p>Windows 8 is launching this fall, and for many small businesses it will be time to upgrade to the new OS. For other versions of Windows though (particularly Windows 7), installation or reinstallation can be a way to "freshen up" a system and increase speed. Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Determine which kind of installation you need.</strong> There are different types, depending on your situation. For example, you might opt for a new install to wipe the system and start new, or instead choose a parallel install that creates a new OS that can run alongside your current system. Many people who have numerous software problems choose a "clean install," which wipes the computer clean and then installs the system as if the computer were new.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Back up your data first.</strong> Before touching the OS or downloading anything, make sure your data is safe, preferably in more than one location. Although your information should be fine after an install, it's better to be prepared for disaster than to lose any data.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Have your software installation discs ready.</strong> If you opt for a clean install, it will wipe your applications as well as your OS, so you'll have to reinstall the software. Make sure you locate all the relevant discs and info beforehand.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Read through tutorials before starting the install.</strong> There are plenty of step-by-step resources available that will guide you through the installation process. For example, 
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/operatingsystems/tp/install-windows-7.htm">this guide</a> can take you through a clean install, new install or startup repair for Windows 7 as well as other Windows versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Upgrade an Operating System</em></p>

<p>Before making the jump to the next level of Windows OS, consider these factors:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Compatibility with older software.</strong> If there are programs that truly run your enterprise, make sure they'll work with a new OS.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Effectiveness with older hardware.</strong> Although an OS upgrade generally makes computers run faster, which boosts productivity, the opposite can be true if the machine is too old to support the upgrade. To minimize problems, look at the minimum system requirements required to run the OS and make sure your computer makes the grade.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Compatibility with devices.</strong> An OS upgrade can affect all kinds of hardware components and peripherals, including storage devices, graphics cards, printers, cameras and even keyboards. For software, hardware and peripherals, look at the 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win7/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US">Windows 7 Compatibility Center</a> for a quick double-check.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Software Savvy</h2>

<p>Sometimes, effectiveness and better time management can be found through new software options.</p>

<p>
<em>Top Productivity Software Choices</em>
<em> </em></p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>WinCalendar.</strong> Geared toward Microsoft Word and Excel, this calendar program is popular and highly rated for a reason. The software offers plenty of choices when it comes to creating a new calendar: adding notes to specific dates, accessing calendar info and navigating between the calendar and open software applications. Also, it's affordable and easy to use. With all those advantages, it may be time to upgrade your calendar software and increase productivity as a result.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.simplestickynotes.com/">
<strong>Simple Sticky Notes</strong></a>
<strong>.</strong> Full-featured applications can be very useful, but sometimes all you need is a streamlined, easy way to keep track of details, to-do items and quick reminders. This free program emulates traditional sticky notes, and you can even choose yellow if you like that classic look. Unlike the paper sticky notes that might adorn your workspace, though, these notes can be quickly organized and categorized.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Time &amp;amp; Chaos.</strong> Part of productivity is managing client information easily, and this well-rated CRM contact manager software makes that task a breeze. The program lets you create appointment calendars and to-do lists that link to your contact data. Best of all, you can share your data with everyone on the company network, without additional licensing fees. You'll have better use of your time, without the chaos of disorganization.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Installation Tips: Download-only vs. Physical Installation</em></p>

<p>With the introduction of so many mobile apps, users have grown accustomed to downloading software instead of using installation disks. However, both approaches have certain benefits.</p>

<p>Download-only advantages:</p>

<ul>

<li>Often less expensive than packaged software because there are no distribution or manufacturing costs</li>

<li>Quicker to obtain, since you don't have to wait for delivery or buy from a store</li>

<li>Better availability and selection, because many programs are only available as downloads</li>
</ul>

<p>Physical installation advantages:</p>

<ul>

<li>No need to be connected to the Internet to install a program</li>

<li>Computer download times not an issue</li>

<li>Fewer issues with firewalls and antivirus programs</li>

<li>Easier reinstallation if necessary</li>

<li>Sometimes accompanied by printed materials that help explain the program</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tech Tools</h2>

<p>With a strong knowledge of an OS and some well-chosen software applications, you should be on your way to a more productive workday.</p>

<p>For an additional turbo boost, make sure your computer is running at top speed, clean out all data that doesn't need to be stored and improve your security so that it makes operations more streamlined.</p>

<p>Power losses due to storms or other emergencies can put you and your data at risk. Learn to keep your small business safe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mother nature doesnt always play nice. As weve seen several times in the past year, snowstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes can wreak havoc on our communities. They can knock out our power and we can lose our ability to communicate with each other through cell phones, landlines and email.</p>

<p>We might prefer not to think about these kinds of natural disastersor even worse, some human made disastersbut staying prepared is the best way to weather any storm. You can prepare your business by creating a plan that will help safeguard its assets, allow it to function (at least partially) during an emergency and let you get back to business as soon as possible after the crisis has passed.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/products/120624/19812/index.html">Preparing for emergencies</a> now will save you an enormous amount of energy, time and money later on, and may even prevent you from having to close your business for good.</p>

<h2>Have An Emergency Plan in Place</h2>

<p>If your business were struck by a flood or covered with four feet of snow tomorrow, would you know how to protect your computers, your network, your data? Who would you call? What would your employees do?</p>

<p>Every small business owner should create a step-by-step list of things she should do when faced with an emergency situation. Start by considering what types of disasters you might face. While flooding and fire can happen anywhere, some threats, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, vary by region. Create a separate protocol for each contingency: one for major flooding, another for a simple power outage and another for a hurricane.</p>

<p>You, and your employees, should know how to turn off the gas, electricity and other utilities in your office. You should know which data backup drives can be taken with you as you leave the building and where they are located. Of course, you and your employees should know how to safely exit your building.</p>

<p>Once you are free from danger, you should have a list of people you will contact as soon as possible, including your insurance agent, any key employees and your data backup service. Since your network may be down and email communication blocked, create a virtual meeting place for you and your employees on an online, third party bulletin board or server. Staying in contact will let you coordinate the process of recovery and getting back to work.</p>

<h2>Essential Emergency Equipment for the Small Business</h2>

<p>Writing your emergency plan will help you make decisions during the first critical minutes and hours of an emergency. Doing so will also help you to decide which kinds of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/products/120624/19812/index.html">emergency equipment</a> you will need to have on hand, both to prevent loss of your critical assets, as well as to protect you and your employees from harm.</p>

<h2>Asset Protection
<em> </em></h2>

<p>Every small business has its critical assets, those goods without which it cannot function. Some businesses may have inventory of some sort and most will have computing and networking equipment. Comprehensive, up-to-date insurance is thus key to the health of any company. Make sure your plan insures you from loss in the event of a disaster.</p>

<p>Today the most valuable asset of any business is often its data, the information created, stored and shared across your network. The small business must have the tools that will keep its data safe, no matter what the emergency.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Data backup. </strong>When the power goes out in your business, you are in danger of losing critical business data. For this reason, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-ultimate-staples-easytech-backup-guide.html">data duplication</a> is a necessity, and there are several tools you can use for this task. To start, back up your hard drives with additional drives or data storage systems. Make sure that changes made to data are automatically updated in these systems. Many companies with large networks will also want backup servers that can continue to distribute data during or after an emergency.
<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, if your business is hit by a tornado or another force of nature, these backup solutions may be damaged as well. Thus, if possible, data backup should occur offsite as well, whether in one of your own offsite servers or through the services of a data backup company. Data may also be saved to the cloud, for virtual backup. This last has the advantage of allowing you to access data wherever you may be should you have to relocate after an emergency.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Power backup. </strong>Should your power fail, data can be corrupted or destroyed, and therefore it is necessary to prevent sudden power surges or failures in your computers and servers. To start, each computer station must be equipped with surge protectors to prevent electrical overloads.
<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Second, the use of uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) will keep electricity flowing to your hardware during the first critical minutes or hours of a power outage. The UPS is placed between your computer and the wall socket, much like a surge protector, and automatically supplies power to the PC when the lights go off. When your power returns or your generators kick in, the UPS automatically transfers to that source. Although the UPS will only supply electricity for a few minutes or a few hours depending on the model, this can be long enough to get other power sources running.</p>

<p>Last, many small businesses will benefit from the use of electrical generators that kick in a minute or two after power failure. Generators will not only keep your network powered during emergencies, thus minimizing your downtime, they can also prevent your heating and air conditioning from failing. Servers and computers can be badly damaged by running in extreme heat or cold.</p>

<h2>Personal Protection
<em> </em></h2>

<p>When that big thunderstorm or earthquake hits, you will also need to have on hand the tools that will help keep you and your employees safe. These are the emergency supplies every small business should have on hand:</p>

<ul>

<li>Flashlights and extra batteries</li>

<li>First aid kits</li>

<li>Fire extinguishers</li>

<li>Portable tool sets, including wrenches to turn off natural gas lines</li>

<li>Bottled water and nonperishable food for your employees</li>

<li>Safety gloves and supplies such as caution tape, high visibility safety vests and traffic cones</li>

<li>Rain gear</li>

<li>Battery powered weather radios and two way radios for staying in communication should phone service be interrupted</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stay Prepared and Stay Safe</h2>

<p>Knowing what to do when an emergency strikes, and having the proper tools on hand, can mitigate loss and protect your critical assets. Keep your emergency plans up to date and use the latest in data protection tools.</p>

<p>We may wish for a world without natural disasters, but at some point most of us will come face to face with a bad storm or earthquake. Preparing now will allow you to respond quickly, calmly and effectively.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Want to host a webinar that your clients will love and remember? Check out this handy guide to getting it right.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hosting a webinar can seem daunting at first  there's software to learn, ideas to collate and perhaps that lifelong fear of public speaking to conquer. But with a little practice and some essential knowledge, you can put together an online presentation that's entertaining, informative and memorable.</p>

<p>In this column, we'll share some useful tips for crafting a webinar that achieves your key goals.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Pick the Right Topic</h2>

<p>Step one is to pick a topic that people genuinely want to learn about. The most common mistake for first-time presenters is droning on and on about everything they do, or about everything they think.</p>

<p>As in all presentations, less is more in webinars. Choose a tightly focused topic that addresses a specific pain point, issue or need of your target audience, and you'll have a far greater chance of locking in high attendance.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Pick a Great Title</h2>

<p>Speaking of attendance, take some time to come up with a good title. Trivial as it may sound, webinars that sound like college lectures rarely earn the kind of standing-room-only crowd that their savvier-titled counterparts do.</p>

<p>Think of a name you'd want to click on if it were a news headline. Contrarian ideas, provocative language and handy list formats are all widely known to attract more traffic on the web. These same qualities extend to naming a marketing tool like a webinar as well.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Be Entertaining</h2>

<p>Here's a widespread misconception: Webinars are simply slide shows with a voiceover track. Not so! A webinar can be anything you make it, including a multimedia presentation or an interactive Q&amp;amp;A.</p>

<p>Many speakers also assume that the webinar format doesn't lend itself to personality. The best webinars, however, shine precisely because of the people behind them. Be funny, spin touching narratives and inject your passion into every part of your presentation. No matter how far-flung your audience, there is simply no substitute for a human connection like this, even on the web.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Be Brief</h2>

<p>This is a tricky one for many presenters. After announcing a webinar, it's a common urge to think of this as your one chance to show the world everything you know. But just as choosing a more focused topic is wise, so is limiting the length of the webinar itself.</p>

<p>Stick with a few key points and speak in simple, clear sentences. Remember that your audience is busy, and that many of them might even have multiple tabs or windows open while they "attend" your presentation. If you keep things punchy and move it along quickly, you have a better chance of holding their interest and fulfilling that crucial call to action at the end.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Use the Format</h2>

<p>Webinars are like in-person presentations in many ways, but you must account for some important differences. You have a more robust set of media available to you during a webinar, including slides, animations, videos, screencasts and digital models. Many presenters shy away from these tools, fearing that they'll distract from the main message. In fact, multimedia can be a great teaching tool and an uncommonly effective way to make a point.</p>

<p>Memorable images register in a deep part of the brain, providing a visual exclamation point that's likely to stick with your audience long after the words have faded. Work with a talented graphic specialist on these for maximum impact.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Be Interactive</h2>

<p>Take advantage of the webinar's potential for interactivity. The tools of online broadcasting go both ways, allowing presenters to collect responses in more or less real time. Think polls, surveys, web forms and chat. Features such as these let you collect valuable data from your audience and keep them invested during the show. They can be used for entertainment purposes ("How many of you have done this stupid thing?") or to solicit actionable data ("Which of these describes your business?").</p>

<p>Of course, the most powerful interactive feature is also the most common: the Q&amp;amp;A. Consider including a segment for questions at the end of your webinar to ensure you've provided a useful and complete presentation.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Be Prepared</h2>

<p>The best presenters choose their words carefully and practice exactly how they're going to pace the show. Although a few freakish savants can speak off the cuff in flawless compound-complex sentences, the rest of us usually need a bit more help.</p>

<p>Write out a script, then memorize it and throw it away. The key to good public speaking is striking a balance between preparation and authenticity. You want to seem prepared, but not robotic. Once you have your webinar down, practice it before the big day. If you're using unfamiliar software, this is especially important for working out the kinks on a given platform.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Test and Repeat</h2>

<p>Webinars are ultimately a form of marketing, which means they can benefit from all the tools of the trade. Collect surveys and response rates after your webinars, and analyze this data for any opportunities to improve what you do. A/B testing and constant tweaking are the surest ways to develop a webinar that entertains, and works.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p>In the end, there may be no more effective tool for learning how to host a webinar than just doing it. Keep detailed notes on the presentations you've seen and write down anything especially unique or compelling that you recall. Then practice, practice, practice.</p>

<p>With some talent and hard work, you can make your own webcam the next viral hotspot in the business world.</p>

<title>What is Telecommuting?</title>
<description>Is telecommuting a solution for your business?</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Broadband connections and productivity apps make it possible for employees to work without leaving home. Is telecommuting a solution for your business?</p></blockquote>

<p>Telecommuting allows employees to work from home for at least a portion of the workweek. U.S. companies increasingly turn to telecommuting to cut costs, allow their employees to balance work and life and help the environment.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Growing with Telecommuting</h2>

<p>While only 2.9 million Americans consider the home to be their primary work location, the numbers are growing. The Telework Research Network (TRN) reports that telecommuting job numbers increased by 61 percent between 2005 and 2009, with the average teleworker working from home 2.4 days a week.</p>

<p>The TRN reported over 70 percent of work-at-home employees hold sales, office, management or professional positions. And while popular opinion claims that telecommuting is best suited to young, technologically savvy employees, the TRN discovered older workers are more likely to hold telecommuting positions.</p>

<h2>Telecommuting Advantages</h2>

<p>Working from home can benefit both business owners and their employees. Telecommuters cite fewer distractions, resulting in higher productivity. Employers save on real estate, office supplies and utility costs.</p>

<p>In addition, severe weather, traffic jams and similar disruptions are less likely to interrupt a telecommuter's productivity. Such conditions can make it impossible for employees to reach the office, while telecommuters can continue to work without interruption (unless, of course, the disaster causes blackouts).</p>

<h2>Telecommuting and the Environment</h2>

<p>Telecommuting also encourages a greener business model.</p>

<p>At present, 2.9 million U.S. adults telecommute, at least for part of the week. All told, this small section of the U.S. workforce saves over 390 million gallons of gas a year, lowering the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by 3.6 million tons.</p>

<h2>Concerns about Telecommuting</h2>

<p>Managers and business owners may balk at the idea of telecommuting. Supervisors worry about loss of employee control and productivity. Managers who have no qualms about leaving a valued employee in charge of projects in-office worry that the same employee will slack off at home.</p>

<p>Communication is also an issue. Less face-to-face interaction can cause miscommunications that slow productivity. Timely communication is also an issue: Managers may worry that telecommuters wont be reachable when they're most needed.</p>

<p>Such concerns are valid up to a point, but are easily overcome. Successful telecommuting relies on choosing employees well suited to independent work and establishing a well thought out telecommuting policy.</p>

<h2>Choosing Telecommuting Staff</h2>

<p>For many employees, telecommuting is both a reward and a sign of their employer's trust. Such rewards should be offered to employees with proven track records of reliability and productivity. Telecommuting employees must work well independently and possess the time management skills needed to prioritize and complete tasks.</p>

<p>Because it's a reward, telecommuting should be a choice, not an order. Some employees, even those who seem custom-made for telecommuting, may prefer to stay in-office. Place your employees where they'll be happiest and most productive.</p>

<h2>Building a Telecommuting Policy</h2>

<p>A solid telecommuting policy clearly defines the employer's expectations from work-at-home staff. Lines of communication need to be clearly laid out. Fortunately, cell phones solve many of the communication problems that once came with telecommuting.</p>

<p>A system for tracking and analyzing productivity is important so both employer and employee understand what's expected from work-at-home staff. With 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/get-help-now/easytech_data_vault/#z_column_contents">cloud storage</a> and file transfer services such as Dropbox, businesses can track employee work and monitor project progress.</p>

<p>Security is, of course, an issue. The telecommuting policy needs to spell out how the employee handles sensitive files and documents out of the office, as well as how such data moves between office and work. Again, secure file-sharing services may provide a solution.</p>

<h2>Staying Connected</h2>

<p>While it's possible to work from home full-time, most employees assign telecommuting duties on a part-time basis. Face-to-face communication remains important for weekly meetings, brainstorming sessions and other team-related activity.</p>

<p>Coming into the office a few times a week prevents the telecommuting employee from feeling isolated, and helps maintain the sense of being part of a team.</p>

<title>The Small Business ROI of ROWE</title>
<description>A new managerial style is gaining ground in the private sector.</description>

<![CDATA[
<blockquote>
<p>A new managerial style is gaining ground in the private sector. Results-Oriented Work Environment (ROWE) eliminates time concerns and focuses solely on employee results.</p></blockquote>

<p>ROWE, or Results-Only Work Environment, describes a radical new management style that focuses on results and productivity instead of office presence and regular work-hours. While the idea of giving employees control over their own work hours sounds disconcerting to many managers, ROWE appears to increase employee productivity and morale while reducing sick days and work-home conflicts.</p>

<h2>How ROWE Works</h2>

<p>ROWE recognizes that results and productivity matter more than a fixed schedule and set workplace. The strategy requires a shift in expectations of both employers and employees.</p>

<p>Employees control their own work schedule, with the understanding that they assume complete responsibility for their duties and results. Teams of employees develop goals, take on responsibilities to achieve those goals, and decide who will work where and when. These agreements are flexible and can be revisited.</p>

<p>ROWE frees managers from the time-consuming tasks of clock- and desk-watching. Instead, supervisors and mangers help teams develop their goals, track results and remove obstacles that hinder productivity.</p>

<h2>ROWE Results</h2>

<p>To people schooled in traditional management strategies, ROWE sounds like a shortcut to absolute chaos. Giving employees free rein to set where and when they work makes managers extremely nervous. Studies of ROWE, however, indicate that far from causing chaos, the flexible work system has a positive impact on both results and employee outlook.</p>

<p>Staff members in ROWE studies report less work-home conflicts, and feel more invested in their company. Health also improves: ROWE participants are more likely to see a doctor if they feel sick, reducing the number of sick days claimed. Healthier, well-rested staff translates into greater productivity.</p>

<p>Even the environment benefits from ROWE. Working at home reduces commute times and exhaust emissions. Businesses have lower utilities as computers and lights dont consume as much power as they would on a 9-to-5 schedule.</p>

<h2>ROWE Considerations</h2>

<p>A company initiating an ROWE strategy can expect some resistance from both managers and, surprisingly, some employees. Managerial concerns usually center on loss of control and the suspicion that employees will abuse their newfound scheduling power.</p>

<p>In practice, managers adapt well to ROWE. No longer constrained by employee monitoring and clock-watching, they can focus on the rewarding aspects of management: guiding employees and monitoring results.</p>

<p>Employees may also resist switching to ROWE. Change, after all, is unsettling. Employee concerns include worrying about loss of guidance and the possibility that the system will result in more work for the individual. Open discussions about ROWE benefits and a commitment to provide management guidance can calm these concerns.</p>

<p>It's important to remember that ROWE stands for Results-Oriented Work Environment. ROWE is not telecommuting, flextime or job-sharing. Remote work, while possible, is not a ROWE requirement.</p>

<p>Some employees embrace the opportunity to work from home, while others feel more comfortable in an office environment. ROWE allows employees to make work-related decisions that work best for them, their team and the company as a whole. And it seems to be working: The private sector increasingly uses ROWE strategies, and government agencies are experimenting with the new system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Virtual Private Networks allow businesses to connect with remote offices, but a VPN isnt without risk. Often, the end user's PC is the most vulnerable part of the network.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even a small business can have several remote offices, especially if employees work from home. Remote offices can access the main office's network using a VPN, or virtual private network. While a relatively safe method of encrypting and transporting data, a VPN is only as secure as its weakest point, the remote PC.</p>

<h2>How a VPN Works</h2>

<p>A VPN uses the Internet to connect remote sites. Because the Internet is a public network, any data sent over the VPN must be encrypted. The most common method of VPN encryption, tunneling, encloses one packet of information inside a second packet, making it unreadable during transport.</p>

<p>VPNs have a number of advantages for businesses. Information can be shared securely between remote locations, and cannot be read en route. Unlike earlier remote access solutions such as leased lines, a VPN can be easily expanded and grow with the business.</p>

<h2>End User Vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>A VPN isnt invulnerable to attack. No standards exist for VPNs, so each company's authentication and security protocols will be slightly different. Some VPNs are vulnerable because their authentication protocols are too weak to withstand a serious attack, but by far the greatest threat to a VPN is an inadequately protected end user PC.</p>

<p>A business's main network is likely to be protected by a firewall that protects the system from unauthorized access. The company may include an IT department that ensures all computers have the latest operating system patches and most-up-to-date antivirus configuration files.</p>

<p>None of this matters if your VPN connects to a vulnerable PC. Remote user computers may have outdated 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=antivirus&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home">antivirus programs</a>, unpatched operating systems or lack a firewall. Any of these vulnerabilities can provide an entry point into the VPN, and through the VPN, access to your main network.</p>

<p>High-speed broadband connections greatly increase the speed of VPNs. However, as broadband connections are "always on," an end user may be connected to a VPN for long periods, increasing the risk of unwanted intrusion.</p>

<h2>Setting Network Policies</h2>

<p>The company network policy should insist that all computers used to access the VPN have a firewall, and all operating systems, antivirus programs and antispyware programs be updated regularly. Employees should read and sign the policy before being allowed on the network.</p>

<p>Strong passwords are essential for end users accessing a VPN network. A strong 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-most-unsafe-password-choices-of-2011.html">password</a> requires a combination of letters, numbers and symbols, and should be at least 14 characters long. Company IT departments can set up networks so only passwords that meet these criteria are accepted during password creation.</p>

<h2>Managed Software</h2>

<p>If you'd rather not rely on a remote employee's ability to update and maintain firewalls and antiviral programs, you have the option of purchasing managed software. Managed software allows a central administrator to control updates and lock down settings.</p>

<p>Managed software works best for branch offices and other situations where employees use company-owned computers. For the at-home employee using a personal computer, managed software can become problematic, especially if the employee uses his or her computer for activities other than work.</p>

<h2>Technical Defenses</h2>

<p>A VPN network can defend itself from vulnerabilities. For instance, a remote access account lockout will lock down a user account after a pre-determined number of failed password attempts. Unfortunately, this defense does not distinguish between a hacking attack and an employee trying to remember a forgotten password.</p>

<p>The increased threat of always-on broadband connections can also be overcome. Virtual Private Networks can be set to disconnect a user's connection after a set amount of idle time. While this does not guarantee safety from a malicious attack, disconnecting does reduce an attacker's window of opportunity.</p>

<title>Security Tips and Tricks for the Remote Office</title>
<description>A remote office has to be self-sufficient, in terms of both productivity and security. Learn how to keep your branch or home office as safe as possible.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>A remote office has to be self-sufficient, in terms of both productivity and security. Learn how to keep your branch or home office as safe as possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many employees work in remote offices, home offices or other locations removed from their business's headquarters. A branch office usually lacks on-site IT or security staff, so securing a branch officeand the information within the officeoften requires different tactics than main office security. With that in mind, here are some tips to keep your branch offices safe and secure.</p>

<h2>Virtual Networks or Cloud Services?</h2>

<p>Branch offices may require access to software, applications and data stored on the main office servers. Access to such information needs to be carefully controlled.</p>

<p>A VPN, or virtual private network, securely extends the home office network across the Internet, so home and branch offices can connect to the main server. A VPN requires secure authentication methods to prevent intruders from accessing data. In addition, all branch offices must have up-to-date antivirus software and security applications, as a branch office breach could spread through the VPN to the main servers.</p>

<p>High traffic along VPNs can slow down data transfer rates and interfere with lag-sensitive applications. An alternative is to switch to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/get-help-now/easytech_data_vault/#z_column_contents">cloud services</a>, where both data and mission-vital apps are stored remotely and accessed over the Internet. A branch office can then obtain the information it needs without placing the main branches' servers at risk.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Antivirus and Operating System Updates</h2>

<p>Lacking immediate access to IT staff, a branch office needs to ensure that all security programs, software and operating systems are updated regularly. Unfortunately, staff often neglects to install vital updates.</p>

<p>Setting automatic updates for essential software lowers the risk of malware spreading throughout the network. VPN security can also check a remote office's antivirus update signatures and refuse to grant permission to any branch with out-of-date signatures.</p>

<h2>Wireless Encryption</h2>

<p>Remote offices increasingly use wireless connections to access the Internet. Laptop users are especially likely to use Wi-Fi connections and work from multiple locations. Wireless networks are more vulnerable to hackers and malware attacks.</p>

<p>Any Wi-Fi used for business purposes needs encryption protocols in place. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and WPA2 are the most common types of wireless encryption currently in use.</p>

<p>With laptops and mobile devices dominating the computer market, a home office can be truly mobile. Working from coffee shops or internet cafes need not be prohibited, but employers need to impress upon staff that public Wi-Fi is not secure, and sensitive information should never be transmitted over public wireless networks.</p>

<h2>Physical Protection</h2>

<p>Dont neglect physical protection for a branch office. Depending on the nature of the company, people may work late hours in small, isolated offices. In such cases a secure lock, alarm system and 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=fireproof+safe&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home&amp;amp;searchViewTypeGridList=listView">fireproof safe</a> are vital.</p>

<p>A home office also needs a secure lock. The act of locking or unlocking the office helps at-home workers separate work from home life. In addition, a solid lock prevents children or family pets from damaging office equipment.</p>

<p>Branch offices are especially vulnerable to natural disasters, as they are often located in homes or small office complexes. In addition to regular cloud storage backups, a branch office should regularly backup data to a sturdy external hard drive capable of withstanding severe conditions, and keep this hard drive in a location separate from the office.</p>

<p>Finally, dont neglect the importance of a good-quality 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Staples-18-Sheet-Cross-Cut-Shredder/product_790443">paper shredder</a>. Branch offices are just as vulnerable as main offices to dumpster-divers looking for improperly disposed sensitive documents. A branch office may actually be more vulnerable, as low staff numbers reduce the chance of detecting suspicious activity. All sensitive information should be shredded before disposal.</p>

<title>Windows 8 Myths Debunked </title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Windows 8 has sparked a flurry of excitement, speculation and good, old-fashioned doom-saying. Whats real? What isnt? We investigate.</p>

<p>Online commenters, never shy about airing their opinions, offer both praise and condemnation for the new operating system (OS). In such an environment, it's perhaps unsurprising that Windows 8 myths abound. These myths include half-truths, carefully thought-out (but dead wrong) predictions, and one or two rumors that are off-the-charts insane.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the more common misconceptions people have about Windows 8.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Death of the Start Button</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the familiar Windows Start button has indeed disappeared. That part of the myth is true. However, all the functions formerly accessed with the Start button are alive and well.</p>

<p>If you rightclick on the lower left side of the screen you get a pop-up text menu that allows access to Programs and Features, the Control Panel, the Desktop and other features you used to find on the Start button. The functions are still there, even if the button has vanished.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Desktop Is Gone, Too</strong></p>

<p>It's easy to see where this myth came from. Screenshots of the Windows 8 Start page show blocks of application tiles, which seem to have replaced the Desktop. If you check the app blocks, however, you'll find that one of them actually is your Desktop. Click on this tile to open the Desktop.</p>

<p>
<strong>You Can't Close Open Apps</strong></p>

<p>This myth probably began because the app tiles don't have an obvious "close" option, but closing applications is fairly simple. All you need to do is position the mouse pointer in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. A sidebar appears that shows all active applications. Right-click the app you want closed and select "
<strong>Close.</strong>"</p>

<p>
<strong>Forget the Apps, You Can't Even Power Down</strong></p>

<p>Okay, at this point the rumor mill starts to get silly. Really? We're expected to believe that Microsoft would design an operating system that needs a hard crash in order to shut off the computer?</p>

<p>This myth developed because Windows 8 changed the location and appearance of your power-off options. In the lower righthand corner of the screen is a small box. Hover the mouse pointer over this box (or touch with your finger, if you're using a touch screen) and the right-hand side bar, of Charm Bar, opens. This bar includes features such as 
<strong>Settings</strong>, 
<strong>Notifications</strong> and, of course, 
<strong>Power.</strong></p>

<p>
<strong>Windows 8 Hates Mouse Users</strong></p>

<p>This was an inevitable myth. Microsoft designed Windows 8 to work with both touch screens and computer mice. Some people immediately decided this meant the company was throwing mouse users to the virtual wolves (or, this being the Internet, LOLcats).</p>

<p>The argument goes like this: "Microsoft wants its piece of the tablet pie so they made Windows 8. If Windows 8 supports touch screens, then it must focus on touch-technology and ignore the needs of mouse users." This is despite Microsoft's insistence that the operating system works well with both technologies, because, according the conspiracy theorists, you can't trust what they say.</p>

<p>To be fair, this is less a myth than an opinion. Mouse skills vary widely from user to user. If you have difficulty pointing, clicking and dragging items, then Windows 8 comes with a steep learning curve. You won't necessarily be using the mouse any more than you do with Windows 7; you'll just be using it differently.</p>

<p>
<em>It's go time for Microsoft and its completely overhauled operating system, Windows 8. Why should you care? Let our small business technology experts explain.</em></p>

<p>When Windows 8 launched on October 26, 2012, the event marked a turning point in Microsoft's tried and true operating system interface. As the first Microsoft operating system to fully support touchscreen technology alongside traditional mouse and keyboard commands, Windows 8 looks, feels and acts differently from its predecessors.</p>

<p>The new Windows 8 Modern UI Start screen, filled with colorful application tiles, could come as a shock to users accustomed to a relatively Spartan desktop environment.</p>

<p>Many potential users have important questions about this new operating system. For instance, why would Microsoft release a new operating system on the heels of Windows 7? Can Windows 8 tablets compete with the popular and well-established iPad? And, perhaps most importantly, is Windows 8 worth your time?</p>

<p>
<strong>How do we benefit?</strong></p>

<p>Now that Windows 8 has enjoyed some time in actual customers hands, many are finding the touchscreen technology to be a fast, accurate and intuitive alternative to traditional mouse-and-keyboard interactions. This isnt to say the mouse and keyboard are headed for retirementespecially for business-class usersbut for home use and casual content consumption (think: movies and web browsing), its more than proven its mettle as an operating system.</p>

<p>More importantly, however, Windows 8 has a baked in ability (read: right out of the box) that allow users to synchronize and share information across various hardware platforms, including tablets, Windows 8 smartphones, desktops and laptops.</p>

<p>The advantages of a single operating system for all electronic devices are obvious. Someone traveling for business can access the home office directly from her tablet or smartphone, update information on the fly and access files at any time. Sensitive files can remain on the home office servers, accessed only when needed. Bluetooth capabilities make sharing even more convenient.</p>

<p>Individuals may have less compelling reasons to update from Windows 7 immediately, but the new operating system isn't just a business application. New applications designed specifically for Windows 8 and sold or distributed for free from the Windows Store make it easy to share information  and receive updates  from various social media sites. Windows 8 apps also provide easy access to Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and similar sites.</p>

<p>
<strong>One OS, Three Versions</strong></p>

<p>Windows 8 comes in three versions: Windows 8, Windows 8 Pro and Windows RT. Which version you choose depends on your personal needs and your device's processor.</p>

<p>Windows 8 will be the operating system's standard edition, is available for PCs, laptops, and tablets that use x86 processors. Windows 8 Pro offers more bells and whistles for the computer enthusiast, including domain management, virtual operating system capabilities and file encryption. That version is aimed squarely at business-class users with greater demands of their OS. Windows RT is intended for devices running on ARM processors, and offers improved battery life for ultra slim devices like tablets and phones.</p>

<p>
<strong>Visible and Invisible Changes</strong></p>

<p>The Windows 8 Start screen, with its bright, primary colored app tiles, puts people used to the old Desktop interface at bit off-balance initially, but navigating among the tiles quickly becomes second nature.</p>

<p>Like many other vendors today, Microsoft offers both free and purchasable apps through an online store, called Windows Store, with a link to the store prominently displayed on the Start screen. Microsoft vets all apps before adding them to the store, so the risk of malware infections due to rogue apps is almost negligible. Better still, software updates are automatically tracked. When one of your applications from the Windows Store has an available update, the system will automatically alert you so you can download at your convenience. No tedious monthly tracking necessary.</p>

<p>Under the hood, Windows 8 offers some features that improve on Windows 7. Most significantly, Windows 8 includes a built-in antivirus program, making third-party viral protection unnecessary, and saving the user the cost of an annual antivirus program subscription.</p>

<em>As is the case with any major operating system upgrade, there are a fair share of improvements and new features you will encounter when using Windows 8 for the first time.</em></p>

<p>
<strong>Windows 8 is for Sharing</strong></p>

<p>The ability to share information between multiple platforms and different accounts is one of Windows 8's most powerful features. Synchronizing PC, laptop and smartphone settings is quick and easy, and the operating system allows users to customize what information is shared and what stays private.</p>

<p>Windows 8 apps allow users to monitor social media sites, image hosting sites and other online accounts at a glance through "toasts," or streaming notifications. Features such as the Photo app allow users to access images in local folders, SkyDrive (an online storage site), Flickr and Facebook. One of Microsoft's stated goals with Windows 8 is to facilitate information sharing, and the operating system certainly looks like it delivers.</p>

<p>
<strong>BuiltIn Protection</strong></p>

<p>Windows 8 comes with a builtin firewall, which is not a surprise, as Windows 7 had the same feature. The new operating system, however, adds antivirus protection to its Security Essentials program, including a feature protecting against malware in bootable USB drives.</p>

<p>
<strong>One Browser, Two Versions</strong></p>

<p>Open the included Internet Explorer and you get a browser that runs exclusively on HTML 5 and doesn't support Flash or website plug-ins. Access Internet Explorer from the Classic Desktop (its the tile marked Desktop on the Start page), however, and you get a browser that supports plug-ins. If you're using Windows 8 on a portable device, this option could be quite helpful: An HTML 5 browser conserves battery power and provides a more secure browsing experience.</p>

<p>Windows 8 supports mouse and keyboard use, but the new tile-based Modern UI really shines when used on a touch screen. Opening, closing and manipulating Windows 8-exclsuive apps with fingers is fluid, fast and remarkably intuitive.</p>

<p>
<strong>Quick and Easy Swiping</strong></p>

<p>Swiping, pinching windows and selecting desktop tiles works beautifully on Windows 8. A swipe to the left opens an applications tray with tiles for all active, open apps. Select an app from this list by swiping it to the right onto your desktop, and it opens in full-screen mode.</p>

<p>Swiping down the Start screen opens the 
<strong>All Apps</strong> Charm menu. If you swipe down while in an active app, however, you open the menu options for that application.</p>

<p>You move through the Start screen by swiping the mouse or a finger to the left or right, producing instant results. Swipe up or down on a Start screen tile and you access the same options available when you right-click the tile with a mouse. You can zoom in by stretching two fingers across the screen (and vice versa by pinching your fingers together).</p>

<p>Dragging and dropping tiles is intuitive. Leave your finger on the screen and the tile travels along with your finger until you release. Swiping a tile quickly sets it moving in the direction you want it to go, and it continues moving until you tap it or it runs out of room.</p>

<p>When you drag and drop an app, you'll notice a slight pause after you release the tile. Windows 8 provides this pause to give you time to change your mind if you dragged the tile to the wrong location. Microsoft calls these pauses "speed bumps" or, if you like more of a sci-fi feel to your computer terminology, "gravity wells." While it might seem like pauses would interfere with the touch experience, they feel very natural.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Double Keyboard</strong></p>

<p>Windows 8 includes two touch screen keyboards: a full sized keyboard for word processing and a simple thumb keyboard for texting or jotting down notes on the go. Both keyboards are responsive, and a predictive spelling feature offers suggestions for words as you type.</p>

<p>You can also write directly on the screen with either a finger or stylus. Finger writing is slow, but gets the job done. Stylus writing, when combined with an app that supports handwriting, is remarkably fast and accurate.</p>

<p>
<strong>Touch Screens and Internet Explorer</strong></p>

<p>The touch interface works well in Internet Explorer, with one or two small quibbles. Swiping across the screen moves you to the previous page or the next page, depending on whether you swipe to the right or left. Swiping up and down scrolls through the Web page.</p>

<p>Clicking a link is as easy as tapping it. Windows 8 does a good job of predicting if you meant to tap a link, so you don't have to be too accurate: clicking close to the link works. This does mean, however, that you need to avoid tapping links when you just meant to tap an empty section of screen.</p>

<p>The operating system stumbles a little when you try to select text from a browser window. Once you tap the screen you can drag your finger across the text, but you have to be accurate with that first tap. While not a huge issue, its a little different from previous versions.</p>

<p>Overall, Microsoft has succeeded in creating a fluid and easy-to-master touchscreen interface, especially when working with the Windows 8-exclusive apps downloaded from the Windows Store.</p>

<p>
<em>Windows 8 is packed with features designed to make your computing life a little easier. We share the best of the best.</em></p>

<p>After the launch of Microsoft's Windows 8 we leapt at the chance to explore the new operating system, returning with all manner of secret treasures, useful shortcuts and, in one suspicious case, a bad sunburn and a flower lei. Here are a few of our favorite Windows 8 secrets.</p>

<p>
<strong>Get Off the Beaten Path with Shortcuts</strong></p>

<p>Windows 8 represents a serious attempt on the part of Microsoft to break into the touchscreen tablet market. This doesn't mean, however, that mouse and keyboard users have been left out in the cold. Windows 8 includes a number of keyboard shortcuts that makes navigating from the Start screen and switching applications quick and easy.</p>

<p>Pressing the 
<strong>Windows</strong> button by itself jumps you between the Start screen and the last app you used. Other favorites include:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Windows button + D</strong>: opens the desktop.</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows + E</strong>: opens Explorer.</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows + F</strong>: opens File Search.</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows + I</strong>: launches Settings.</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows + Q</strong>: opens App Search.</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows + Tab</strong>: Cycle through open apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft has improved the old screenshot shortcut. Pressing 
<strong>Windows + PrtScr</strong> doesn't add the screen shot to Clipboard anymore. Instead, the shortcut saves the screenshot directly to the 
<strong>My Pictures</strong> file under the name Screenshot.png.</p>

<p>
<strong>Multiple Monitor Machinations</strong></p>

<p>Users increasingly work with two monitors, and Windows 8 acknowledges this. Pressing 
<strong>Windows + PgUp</strong> moves your currently selected app to the lefthand monitor, while 
<strong>Windows + PgDn</strong> shoots the app over to the righthand monitor.</p>

<p>
<strong>Organizing App Groups</strong></p>

<p>Organizing Windows 8 apps into groups is easy and intuitive. Choose one of the apps you want to include in the new group and drag the tile to an empty area of the Start screen. A new app group automatically starts. Move apps into the new group by dragging them there.</p>

<p>To name the new group, click the small icon in the bottom right of the screen. The Modern UI tiles will shrink to thumbnails. Right click the new group and a 
<strong>Name Group</strong> icon pops up. Click this icon and type in the new group's name.</p>

<p>
<strong>You Get What You Type</strong></p>

<p>Here's a quick timesaver if you want to access a program in Windows 8 without hunting through all the Start screen app tiles. Just type in the name of the program you want. You don't need to click on the screen or open a search box: Just start typing with the mouse pointer anywhere on the screen, and Windows 8 finds the program for you. It's a nice little timesaver when you need to open little-used programs.</p>

<p>
<strong>Scheduling Computer Maintenance</strong></p>

<p>Windows 8 helpfully automates system maintenance tasks, such as software updates, virus scans and similar diagnostics. Unfortunately, the default time for these important housecleaning tasks is set to 3:00 a.m. That's fine if your hardware allows the system to wake up the computer, but pretty much useless if your system lacks that ability.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can quickly change these settings by launching the 
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, selecting 
<strong>System and Security</strong> and clicking on 
<strong>Action Center</strong>. Once the 
<strong>Action Center</strong> opens, click on 
<strong>Maintenance</strong>. Now you can choose a more convenient time for maintenance under the 
<strong>Start Maintenance</strong> option.</p>

<p>
<strong>Sneaky Syncing</strong></p>

<p>Windows 8 can synchronize settings on multiple devices, so your tablet, Windows Phone and PC can share the same Windows Live account. The operating system will share Contacts, calendar events and other information among your devices.</p>

<p>Handy though this is, some information may be too sensitive for synchronizing. You can customize the syncing operation by pressing 
<strong>Windows + I</strong> and clicking 
<strong>More PC Settings</strong>. Click on 
<strong>Sync Your Settings</strong> and you get a list of twelve possible items that you can omit from synchronization. Some of these items are highly sensitive, such as website passwords. Others, such as background screens, are unlikely to attract the attention of identity thieves, but handy if you like to customize devices individually.</p>

<p>If you don't want to synchronize your devices, choose 
<strong>Local Account</strong> instead of 
<strong>Microsoft Account</strong> when you set up your account. You can switch between 
<strong>Local Account</strong> and 
<strong>Microsoft Account</strong> at any time by opening the 
<strong>PC Settings</strong> and selecting 
<strong>Users</strong>.</p>

<p>
<strong>Finding Your Recycle Bi</strong></p>

<p>Windows 8 lists open applications in its lefthand navigation pane (just move the mouse pointer to the left side of the screen to open the pane). The navigation pane is designed with simplicity in mind: You won't see any links to your 
<strong>Control Panel</strong> or 
<strong>Recycle Bin</strong> here. If you like quick access to your folders, click 
<strong>View</strong> on the pane and then click 
<strong>Options</strong>. Now you can select 
<strong>Show all Folders</strong>.</p>

<p>
<strong>Refresh and Wipe</strong></p>

<p>While Windows 8 runs quite well, circumstance may force you to restore the system. The new 
<strong>Recovery</strong> option in the 
<strong>Control Panel</strong> gives you three different options for restoring your system. 
<strong>System Restore</strong> works pretty much the same way it always has, restoring your settings to the last System Restore point.</p>

<p>The 
<strong>Refresh Your PC</strong> option completely reinstalls Windows 8 while keeping your existing files intact. And when the time comes to replace your PC, the 
<strong>Reset Your PC</strong> button completely wipes your files before reinstalling Windows. (Pro Tip: Confuse these two buttons at your peril.)</p>

<p>
<strong>Pruning Your Startup Menu</strong></p>

<p>"Startup Creep" afflicts many a Windows user. Many programs insist on "helpfully" adding themselves to your Startup menu during installation, so they open automatically when you boot up the computer. Auto-start programs are like leeches, sucking up your system's resources. Depending on the software, you may not even realize a programs opening every time you boot up.</p>

<p>Windows 8 has added a Startup tab to a redesigned 
<strong>Task Manager</strong>. The 
<strong>Startup</strong> link lists all programs that open during Startup. You can check off any programs you don't want running and then click the 
<strong>Disable</strong> button.</p>

<em>Mobile devices get stolen all the time. How do you make sure your business data stays safe when someone swipes your smartphone?</em></p>

<p>Mobile devices are a mixed blessing to the small business. While tablets and smartphones allow employees to take business documents on the road, they're all oh-so-tempting for a thief. A momentary distraction in a coffee shop or airport lobby and your tablet's vanished, along with all your business and personal information.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Norton-Anti-Theft-3-Device-Boxed-CD/product_697697">Anti-theft software</a> helps you safeguard your data in the event of theft. Depending on the software, you can either lock your device to prevent data access or virtually "shred" all information on the device.</p>

<p>Some programs also allow you to take remote control of your device's webcam, allowing you to log on remotely and snap incriminating pictures of the thief. Tracking capabilities are common features, so you can locate your device through GPS.</p>

<p>If you're a road warrior who routinely stores sensitive data on mobile devices, anti-theft software isnt an option: It's a necessity.</p>

<em>An office shredder prevents important documents from sneaking out with the trash.</em></p>

<p>While high-tech hacking and online security breaches get all the news, dumpster diving remains one of the most common means of stealing information. A small office shredder can keep your business data safe.</p>

<p>Not all documents are information sensitive, but contracts, client data, accounting sheets and similar sensitive business information all need shredding. As a general rule, err on the side of caution: If you think an item might need shredding, it probably does.</p>

<p>Three types of shredder exist. A 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Staples-30-Sheet-Strip-Cut-Shredder/product_723134">strip-cut shredder</a> shreds paper in long thin strips, so the shredder can handle multiple pages at once. A determined individual, however, could conceivably reconstruct documents from paper strips.</p>

<p>A 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Staples-18-Sheet-Cross-Cut-Shredder/product_790443">cross-cut shredder</a> cuts documents into small particles for greater security, but cannot handle as much volume at once as a strip-cut shredder.</p>

<p>Businesses that deal with extremely sensitive documents might want to consider a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Staples-12-Sheet-Micro-Cut-Shredder/product_356139">micro-cut shredder</a>, which reduces documents into tiny, snowflake-sized particles.</p>

<title>Consider the Office Safe</title>

<p>
<em>While external hard drives and cloud storage get all the attention, the humble office safe remains a reliable place to secure sensitive information.</em></p>

<p>In today's world of online banking, cloud services and 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/pros-and-cons-of-the-modern-day-business-phone.html">smartphones</a> an office safe almost seems quaint, but dont overlook the protection and convenience that a safe brings. The mere fact that office safes remain popular is a sign of their continued usefulness.</p>

<p>An office safe remains a wise investment for any office that deals with sensitive materials or cash. An 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=safe&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home&amp;amp;searchViewTypeGridList=listView">office safe</a> lets you leave important items in the office on short notice without worrying about security. While it's true a determined group of thieves could carry off an office safe, they still have to crack it open, which, despite what Hollywood thinks, remains a challenge beyond the average crook's capabilities.</p>

<p>If you're in the market for a safe, look for one that's fireproof for added protection. Size is also an issue. A large safe is more difficult to move: Good news if the office is burglarized, but problematic if you have to move it yourself. Smaller safes are easier to conceal, while remaining too heavy to casually carry out of the office.</p>

<title>Wipe, Erase and Shred: How to Destroy Data for Good</title>
<description>Your Recycle Bin lies to you: Deleted files aren't as deleted as you'd think. Learn how to ensure your data really is gone for good.</description>

<p>
<em>Your Recycle Bin lies to you: Deleted files aren't as deleted as you'd think. Learn how to ensure your data really is gone for good.</em></p>

<p>Most people assume that once they delete a file from their computer, it's irretrievable. For better or worse, that's not the case. When you delete a file, all you actually delete is the information the computer's operating system needs to find the file. The data itself sits on your computer until overwritten by new filesand even then forensic software can sometimes retrieve a portion of the original information.</p>

<p>Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing: If you just accidently deleted this month's payroll, there's a good chance an IT expert can retrieve the file. However, you could also completely reformat a computer before disposal and leave sensitive business information lurking on the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=internal+hard+drive&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home&amp;amp;autocompletesearchkey=internal+hard+drive">hard drive</a>. Fortunately, you have a few options for permanently deleting files.</p>

<h2>Overwriting Data, the DoD Way</h2>

<p>Overwriting data multiple times renders it completely unreadable. Use a software program that meets the Department of Defense's guidelines for data overwriting. Programs such as SDelete, Boot and Nuke and East-Tec DisposeSecure overwrite all areas of the hard drive with complex patterns of meaningless data. Some versions of overwriting software target the entire hard drive, while others allow for targeted strikes on specific file locations.</p>

<p>DoD guidelines recommend overwriting data seven times. If you're dealing with extremely sensitive data, you could use the Guttman method of file overwriting, which calls for overwriting data 35 times. The Guttman method isnt very time-efficient however, as it can take days to wipe a single drive.</p>

<h2>Hard Drive Destruction</h2>

<p>If you have no plans to pass an old computer on to someone else, destroying the hard drive's platters will prevent people from accessing your data. A hard drive shredder is an expensive piece of equipment that resembles the love child of an office paper shredder and a wood chipper. The machine crushes, chops and generally obliterates hard drives.</p>

<p>Hard drive shredders are prohibitively expensive, but you can hire their services from data protection services. Some services ask you to ship the hard drive to them, while others mount the shredder on a truck bed and come to your place of business for on-site destruction.</p>

<p>If you cant find a shredding service, or just want to blow off some steam, you can destroy the hard drive yourself. Do be aware however that many of the methods used to do so can result in sharp fragments flying around. At the very least, wear safety glasses and protective clothing.</p>

<p>The smart way to destroy a hard drive is to open it up with a screwdriver and then sand down the platters. More impulsive methods include taking a sledgehammer to the hard drive, or driving nails through the drive unit with a hammer. Some people even use angle grinders. Again, Staples Tech has no data on how many people wind up at their local ER getting shards of hard drive shrapnel removed from their extremities.</p>

<h1>Degaussing the Drive</h1>

<p>A subtler, less dangerous method of destroying hard drive information is to demagnetize the drive, a technique more properly known as degaussing. You can't do this yourself, even with a powerful magnet; you need a specialized degaussing service.</p>

<p>Degaussing realigns the drive platters magnetic orientation, reducing the data to meaningless fragments. A really powerful deguasser physically damages the drive's spindle motor and servos, rendering the drive inoperable.</p>

<h2>Encrypt Constantly</h2>

<p>While not a method used to erase data, regularly protecting information with good quality encryption software prevents unauthorized file access. Even if someone retrieves a deleted file, the contents of the file are useless without the decryption password.</p>

<h2>Remote Wipes</h2>

<p>Dont overlook your mobile devices when you're protecting your data. Laptops, smartphones and 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/technology-research-centers/tablets/index.html?cmSearchKeyword=tablets">tablets</a> are popular targets for thieves. If a device goes missing, you dont want the thief accessing your business files. Remote data wiping services remove information from stolen devices. Some of these services also lock the device, so you have the satisfaction of knowing that the thief wont even be able to use his ill-gotten tech.</p>

<title>Think Your Data Isn't Valuable? Think Again</title>
<description>Data loss can leave a previously healthy small business struggling to survive. A company that doesnt backup information risks bankruptcy at the drop of a corrupted hard drive.</description>

<p>
<em>Data loss can leave a previously healthy small business struggling to survive. A company that doesnt backup information risks bankruptcy at the drop of a corrupted hard drive.</em></p>

<p>Businesses sometimes undervalue their data, and it's certainly true that not all data has equal value. From a purely monetary point of view, a hard drive full of data owned by the local bicycle repair shop is worth less than an equal amount of data from a small credit union. Having said that, the information on the bike store's hard drive is extremely important in terms of company health, productivity and profits.</p>

<p>In today's data-centric world, a business is only as healthy as its data. Losing access to that data, even for a few days, can cripple a business. Small companies are especially vulnerable, as they lack the resources to ride out large-scale data loss.</p>

<h2>Causes of Data Loss</h2>

<p>The term "data loss" conjures images of shady hackers breaking into business networks to steal precious personal information. While hacking is certainly a risk, the causes of data loss are usually much more mundane.</p>

<p>A 2011 survey by online backup company 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/get-help-now/carbonite_online_backup/#z_column_contents">Carbonite</a> revealed that 48 percent of small businesses with two to twenty employees have experienced data loss. Despite this, 31 percent of businesses owners reported that backing up data was "a hassle."</p>

<p>The most common cause of data loss was hardware / software failure at 54 percent. An additional 54 percent of businesses reported accidental data deletion. (If these numbers seem skewed, remember that individual businesses often reported multiple cases of data loss).</p>

<p>While a significant problem, computer viruses only accounted for 33 percent of lost data events. Data theft came in last, reported by only 10 percent of businesses.</p>

<h2>Data Costs and Small Businesses</h2>

<p>As Carbonite's numbers show, equipment failure and human error greatly outnumber other causes of data loss. Fortunately, IT professionals can retrieve most data lost in these manners. Unfortunately, data retrieval is both time-consuming and expensive.</p>

<p>According to a DeepSpar Data Recovery Systems study, a single data loss incident costs businesses an average of $2,900. Lost productivity accounts for most of the financial cost. If data is irretrievable, costs go even higher. Reentering 20 megabytes of sales and marketing data can take as long as 19 days and cost a company more than $17,000.</p>

<p>A business's financial stability worsens the longer data losses last. According to information from the National Archives and Records Administration, 93 percent of companies that lose access to their data center for ten or more days declare bankruptcy within a year.</p>

<p>A ten-day loss of data is a worst-case scenario, but it's a scenario that businesses particularly smaller businesses  cannot afford to ignore. Even a shorter period of data loss can cripple a small company.</p>

<h2>Backup, Backup and Backup Some More</h2>

<p>If you regularly backup your data, you're much better prepared to deal with a data loss, and will be able to get your business up and running again much faster than if you had to send your hard drive out for data retrieval. If the Carbonite survey is any indication, however, many businesses drag their heels when it comes to data backup.</p>

<p>Yes, backing up data on an 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=external+hard+drive&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home">external hard drive</a> or USB flash drive can, indeed, be an annoyance: You must remember to perform the backup, data transfer takes time and your day's busy enough as it is. In addition, while you can automate cloud backups, youll have to take the time to set up the cloud services.</p>

<p>If either of these objections resonates with you, take another look at the information presented here. The hassle and expense of a serious data breach greatly outweighs the time and financial commitment of backing up your data.</p>

<em>Backing up business data isn't an option: it's a necessity. Learn the ins and outs of data backup.</em></p>

<p>Your business data is valuable: the loss of even a small chunk of data can result in financial losses and lost productivity. Maintaining a regular backup schedule protects you from data loss.</p>

<p>When it comes to backing up data, the modern business has several options. External 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=usb+flash+drive&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home&amp;amp;searchViewTypeGridList=listView">USB flash drives</a> and external hard drives have mostly replaced CDs and DVDs, once the primary means of backing up data.</p>

<p>Flash drives are small, easily transportable and capable of holding an ever-increasing amount of data. Their small size, however, makes them easy to lose or damage. While larger, an external hard drive has more memory, and connects easily to your computer through a USB port.</p>

<p>A third option, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/carbonite-online-backup/index.html?cmSearchKeyword=carbonite">cloud storage</a>, does away with the need for a physical backup. Instead, the business backs up data to a remote server. Cloud services may include scheduling services, so a business can preset when backups occur.</p>

<h2>Data Backups vs. Redundancy Backups</h2>

<p>Business owners sometimes have difficulty differentiating between backing up files and redundancy, and its true the two operations are similar. A backup duplicates data from a specific time, allowing you to recover the data if needed.</p>

<p>In contrast, redundancy duplicates your entire computer system: the operating system, programs, drivers, and other settings needed to operate your computer. If your primary computer fails, a redundancy backup can return your system to its exact state and settings at the time of the backup, or duplicate those settings on a new computer.</p>

<h2>Types of Backup</h2>

<p>A backup system begins with a full backup, which copies every byte of data in the files and folders you select for backup. Full backups take the most time to create, but have the shortest restore times. Because full backups consume so much time, they are used in combination with faster incremental or differential backups.</p>

<p>A differential backup duplicates every change made to selected files since the last full backup. Restore times are short, but every time you make a differential backup, the size of the backup grows. Go long enough, and the differential backup could theoretically become larger (and take longer to restore) than your original full backup.</p>

<p>An incremental backup stores only new or modified files created since the last full, incremental or differential backup. Incremental backups save storage space and are completed more quickly than full or differential backups, but a full restore takes time as you have to restore each increment in order. In addition, if you're looking for a specific file, you have to find the incremental backup containing that file.</p>

<p>Many small companies perform full backups on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on their data flow. In between each full backup, the business makes a nightly incremental or differential backup.</p>

<h2>Storing Your Backup</h2>

<p>If you save your backup to a physical device, store the backup well away from your place of business. If you store your backups in-office, routinely backing up your data will do you no good if a disaster destroys both the original and the backup files.</p>

<p>Small business owners also store backups in their homes (or at the homes of relatives or friends if the business runs out of a home office). Where you store the data doesnt matter, as long as the information is secure and a reasonable distance away from the office.</p>

<p>Businesses that use cloud storage dont have this problem, of course, but still have to consider online security. A cloud storage company should encrypt data and have digital signing protocols to authenticate identities before sending or receiving data. In addition, ask the company about the location and security of their databases; cloud servers should be both physically and virtually secure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No matter how well designed your office printer is, sometimes you need a little extra help. Learn when to step back and hire the printing pros.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes it makes more sense to contract a print job out rather than try to complete it in-house. Professional printing services help you complete printing jobs too largeor too unusualfor most small business printers.</p>

<h2>Mass Production Printing</h2>

<p>As a small business, your printing capabilities probably have some restrictions. That's not intended as an insult: It simply means you operate within the limits of your budget and your printer's capabilities. If your primary printer is a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Brother-HL-5470dwt-Laser-Printer/product_933598">monochrome laser printer</a>, you're going to have difficulty printing a run of 5,000 color brochures. If those brochures require photo-quality images, a laser printer won't be able to provide crisp enough images even if it has color capabilities.</p>

<p>An inkjet printer can handle quality color reproduction, but even the best quality inkjet can only handle about 25 single-side monochrome pages a minute. Presuming an average quality inkjet, which can print approximately 7 color sheets a minute, it would take almost 2 hours to print those 5,000 double-sided brochures.</p>

<p>Materials cost is also a consideration. A printing job on the scale described here will require paper and ink cartridge replacements. Not to mention productivity lost as a staff member monitors the printing, replaces exhausted ink cartridges and collates the final product. Bringing the project to your local Staples Print and Copy Center will save both time and money.</p>

<h2>Binding and Stapling</h2>

<p>But who knows, your business may be set up to handle printing 5,000 color brochures without help (in which case it's fair to assume your business 
<em>is</em> a professional printing service). Even if large-scale printing is an in-house possibility, you'll still run into printing jobs where outside help is a necessity.</p>

<p>Consider, for instance, a large report that needs binding. Now it's true, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Carl-Brands-Ring-Ring-Binding-System-12/product_942206?catalogId=10051&amp;amp;fromUrl=home&amp;amp;cmSearchKeyword=spiral+binding&amp;amp;cmArea=SEARCH&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;searchViewTypeGridList=listView&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;ddkey=http:StaplesSearch">spiral-binding paper cutters</a> and binding materials exist, but again its a matter of time versus money. Small binding jobs can be handled in-house, but binding 100 annual reports? It's more cost effective to let the pros handle it.</p>

<p>Even simple collating and stapling jobs eat into employee productivity, while a professional printer can complete the project much faster with an automated system.</p>

<h2>The Unusual Printing Jobs</h2>

<p>Some printing jobs defeat businesses not because they lack good quality printers, but simply because the print job is of an unusual size. Your office inkjet might be able to handle photo-quality prints as large as 8 x 10 inches, but it's highly doubtful it could handle anything larger. Banners, large posters, and similar advertising all cry out for a professional printing service.</p>

<h2>A Professional Touch</h2>

<p>Finally, there are times when you simply cannot afford anything less than a professional's touch. A company owner can print her own business cards on perforated sheets, for instance, but such cards lack the crispness and smoothness of a professional printing job, and people do notice.</p>

<p>For in-house work and publications, your existing printers probably do the job just fine. Print jobs intended for the public, however, are worth sending to a professional. At Staples, we offer the full range of professional copy and print services.</p>

<title>You Need a Photo-Quality Printer</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Not all printers are created equal. When you need to produce a high-quality photo you normal business printer may not be up to the task.</p></blockquote>

<p>The nature of your business determines your business needs. Some companies print large amounts of text-based content, in which case a monochrome laser printer suits their needs. Others have a greater need for graphic and image-heavy printing. Still others need to reproduce high-quality photo prints. If you fall into the last category, you have two options: a good quality inkjet or a dye sublimation printer.</p>

<h2>Dye Sublimation Printers</h2>

<p>Dye sublimation printers create smooth and realistic photo colors by vaporizing solid dyes. The vaporized dye is then applied to the paper, where the colors soak into the paper surface. Finally, the printer applies a protective coating that shields the ink from moisture, fading and fingerprints. Dye sublimation printers are specialized: They only print photo-quality images.</p>

<h2>Inkjet Printers</h2>

<p>Much more common in business applications than dye sublimation printers, inkjet printers allow businesses to print both photos and text. An inkjet printer sprays the paper with tiny droplets of ink. Inkjets can print on a wider variety of paper sizes than sublimation printers.</p>

<p>Most inkjets use water-soluble inks, which can smudge if the photo is exposed to water. A few use pigment-based ink, which holds its color without fading longer than water-based inks.</p>

<h2>Photo Printer Features</h2>

<p>When choosing a photo-quality printer, look for one that can handle multiple-sized prints. Some smaller photo-printers can only print 4 x 6 inches or wallet-sized prints. A good quality inkjet should be able to print photos in a range of sizes, from 8 x 10 inches down to wallet-sized.</p>

<p>How you connect to the printer is also an issue. Some printers come with built-in memory slots, or connect directly to cameras for quick printing. In most business situations, however, a USB or Wi-Fi connection is more useful, allowing you to connect the printer to your computer network.</p>

<p>Photo-quality printers often have editing capabilities users can access directly from the printer's LED screen. While useful for quick, on-the-fly editing, businesses are more likely to edit photos by computer and then send the edited file to the printer.</p>

<h2>Resolution and Photo-Quality</h2>

<p>If you opt for an inkjet printer, look for one with a high resolution, or dots per inch (dpi). The more dots per square inch, the crisper the photo printout.</p>

<p>Resolution can be tricky when you're comparing inkjet and dye sublimation printers, as the two types of printer deliver ink in very different methods. A low dpi count for a dye sublimation printer may produce an image as clear and vibrant as an inkjet with a much higher dpi.</p>

<h2>Which Printer is Right for You?</h2>

<p>Most businesses opt for an inkjet printer over dye sublimation, taking the reasonable view that they need both text and image printing capabilities. Dye sublimation printers are dedicated photo printers, and require the use of special inks and paper. Inkjets provide more printing options with less expense. If, however, you need to produce moisture-resistant photos that withstand handling, you might want to consider a dye sublimation printer.</p>

<p>One cautionary note: Laser printers do not produce good quality photo images. While laser printers are rightly valued for their ability to reproduce fine details in text and diagrams, theses printers cannot handle the subtle color changes and blending required for lifelike photo printing.</p>

<em>The keyboard you use can have a great impact on your computing comfort and productivity. Let us help you discover which keyboard is right for your work. </em></p>

<p>Buying a computer for your small business means sorting through a lot of choices. Desktop units or laptops for your employees? How much processing power will you need? What size hard drive?</p>

<p>In the list of priorities when choosing computers and their accessories, keyboards might seem pretty far down the page. But the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Keyboards-Mice-Keyboards-Speakers/cat_DP1924">keyboard you use</a> can have a big impact on your PC experience, productivity and your comfort level, especially when youre logging long hours at your machine.</p>

<p>This handy guide will help you choose the right keyboard for the kind of work you do. You might be surprised how many keyboard options are available.</p>

<p>As a bonus, stick around to the end of this article for an overview of some of the wild new keyboard technologies that are just becoming available today.</p>

<h2>Keyboard Layouts</h2>

<p>Almost all keyboards used to type the English language are based on the QWERTY system, developed in the late 1800s for typewriters. This system gets its name from the first six letter-keys on the upper left of a standard keyboard.</p>

<p>QWERTY was developed to prevent jamming of mechanical letter levers in early typewriters. Although computer keyboards cannot jam, the system has stuck, largely because most of us were trained using this layout. An alternative to QWERTY, called the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard, was developed in 1936. Proponents claim it is more suited to actual typing needs and can reduce wrist and finger strain.</p>

<h2>Standard vs. Compact Keyboards</h2>

<p>In addition to the alphabetic keys, the standard keyboard also contains a numeric keypad to the right of the main keys. This layout allows for flexibility in use, and makes it easier to perform number-related tasks. The standard keyboard is also sized to fit the average finger reach, and the keys are sized to fit the average fingertip.</p>

<p>When space becomes a factor, as in laptops and smaller desktop PCs, many manufacturers offer compact keyboards. This setup often eliminates the numeric keypad, and a greater number of special functions are bundled into each key. Keys, and the spacing between them, are smaller.</p>

<p>This smaller size makes for greater portability for people on the go, but it does give up a degree of comfort. Those who type long documents or make many numerical computations may wish to opt for the more standard layout.</p>

<h2>Ergonomic vs. Rectangular Keyboards</h2>

<p>People who spend a lot of time at the computer may wish to invest in an ergonomic keyboard. Unlike the usual flat, rectangular keyboards, ergonomic layouts attempt to minimize finger and wrist strain by reshaping the keyboard to conform to a more natural positioning of your hands.</p>

<p>The keyboard may be split into two halves, the keys may be positioned at a wider angle relative to your body, and the keyboard might be hill shaped, with middle keys higher than those to the left and right.</p>

<p>The primary advantage of ergonomic keyboards is a reduction in repetitive strain injuries for workers who spend long hours typing. It may, however, take a little time to get used to the new shape, especially for those who have been typing with standard, rectangular keyboards for a long time.</p>

<h2>Wired and Wireless Keyboards</h2>

<p>Another choice for the small business owner is between keyboards that plug into the PC and ones that work wirelessly. As with so many communication and computing devices these days, wireless is a growing trend.</p>

<p>And wireless keyboards do offer a great deal of flexibility. Without cords to deal with, you can move your keyboard to any spot on your desk and with some models even across the room. Many of these wireless units use Bluetooth technology that allows you to roam, keyboard in hand, wherever you will.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of wireless keyboards is the potential for interference, especially in offices with a great deal of wireless activity. With signal interference, you may experience a slight lag between pressing a key and its character appearing onscreen.</p>

<h2>Newfangled Keyboard Types</h2>

<p>If these many choices in keyboard design are not enough, a number of newer, high-tech keyboard options are available as well.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Rollup keyboards.</strong> For those who travel a good deal but dont want to give up the comfort and convenience of a standard size keyboard, the rollup keyboard might be a good pick. These keyboards are made of flexible materials that can be rolled to fit in backpacks, purses or briefcases. These keyboards also tend to be water- and spill-proof.</li>

<li>
<strong>Laser keyboards.</strong> Laser keyboards take portability to the furthest possible extent. With these products, a small laser unit projects the outline of a keyboard onto a flat surface. The unit then records the movement of your fingers across this projection. Because your fingers do not interact with any physical object and tactile feedback is therefore absent, some users might be prone to typing incorrect characters.</li>

<li>
<strong>Laptop keyboards.</strong> As the name implies, laptop keyboards are rested on the lap during use. They usually have curved or cushioned undersides to help them conform to your body and to remain stable during typing. Also, these models are often ergonomically designed, with a split or tilted arrangement of keys.</li>

<li>
<strong>Optical keyboards. </strong>The optical keyboard was first introduced in 1962 in an effort to cut down on the noise created by the clacking of keys. Today, this type of keyboard is often used in situations in which liquid spills or dust might be an issue. These sealed keyboards use internal light beams to detect when keys are pressed, sending a corresponding signal to the PC. They tend to have greater tactile feedback than do rollup keyboards, although they are the more expensive option.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all these options, how should you choose the right keyboard for your small business needs? First, determine what features are most important to yousize of keyboard, portability, etc.and then test a few keyboards with those features. At the end of the day, the best keyboard for you is the one that feels right at home beneath your fingertips.</p>

<title>You Need an Inkjet Printer</title>
<description>Inkjet printers often take second place to more powerful laser printers, but a good inkjet remains an important and versatile business tool.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Inkjet printers often take second place to more powerful laser printers, but a good inkjet remains an important and versatile business tool.</p></blockquote>

<p>Inkjet printers have existed since the 1980s, and they remain one of the most popular small business printing solutions. While laser printers dominate the mass-printing market, businesses looking for a versatile printer are well served by the new generation of inkjets.</p>

<h2>How Inkjets Work</h2>

<p>As the name suggests, an inkjet printer sprays tiny droplets of ink onto the page. The droplets themselves are tinybetween 50 to 60 micronsand the printer can combine different ink colors to produce photo-quality images.</p>

<h2>Graphics and Versatility</h2>

<p>While laser printers print faster and with finer text detail than inkjet printers, the inkjet has the advantage of versatility. An inkjet printer can print on regular paper, adhesive sticker paper, business cards, photo-grade paper and even iron-on T-shirt transfers.</p>

<p>When photo-quality images are required, an inkjet actually outperforms laser printers, as laser printers have difficulty reproducing the fine color changes needed for photographic images.</p>

<p>Inkjets also have a size advantage over bulkier laser printers. A small business with limited space will find making room for an inkjet much less challenging than finding room for a bulky laser printer.</p>

<h2>Cost and Maintenance</h2>

<p>At first glance, an inkjet seems the better buy for most businesses. Inkjet printers are significantly cheaper than laser printers. The cost of replacing ink cartridges is a significant factor. Inkjet printer cartridges often require changing after 175-275 printed pages, while a laser printer can produce upwards of 2,000 pages from a single toner sheet.</p>

<p>Because printer heads wear out sooner than other printer parts, some printer manufacturers build the printer heads directly into the ink cartridges, which can also increase cartridge costs.</p>

<p>The difference in maintenance costs is most obvious when cheap printers are compared. Higher quality 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Epson-B-510DN-Business-Color-Inkjet-Printer/product_870086">inkjet printers</a> compare well with laser printers for cartridge lifespans. Generally speaking, though, the less expensive an inkjet printer, the more expensive its upkeep.</p>

<h2>Smudge and Bleeding</h2>

<p>Inkjets are prone to certain printing problems. The ink is water soluble, and printed pages will smudge if they get damp. Ink sometimes "bleeds" into paper fiber, resulting in a smudged look. Better quality printing paper helps prevent bleeding.</p>

<p>While not well suited for high-volume printing, inkjets are a good choice for businesses that have limited printing needs or want to combine photo-quality images with text. It's not unusual for businesses to purchase a laser printer for large print jobs and an inkjet for smaller, specialized jobs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laser printers produce high quality printouts with lower maintenance costs than their inkjet counterparts. If your business requires heavy printing loads, a laser printer is your most economical choice.</p></blockquote>

<p>When laser printers first hit the market, their high price tags and sheer size made them unsuitable for small businesses. Over time, both cost and size have decreased, and today's laser printers offer a cost-effective solution to a small business's printing needs.</p>

<h2>How Laser Printers Work</h2>

<p>Unlike inkjet printers, laser printers dont use ink. Instead, the printers use cartridges of toner, which is a powdery mix of plastics and pigments. The printer contains a drum that carries a photostatic charge. When the printer receives an image, the laser moves across the drum, creating a latent image of the print job by selectively removing electrostatic charge.</p>

<p>Areas of the drum that maintain a charge pick up toner, which is transferred to the paper. Hot rollers then melt the plastic in the toner, fusing the pigments to the page.</p>

<h2>Fast Printing, Fine Details</h2>

<p>Once a laser printer warms up, it prints much faster than its inkjet cousins. High-end 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/HP-Color-LaserJet-CP4025n-Printer/product_844758">laser printers</a> can spit out up to 35-40 pages per minute (ppm), and even less expensive monochrome printers can manage a very respectable 25 ppm.</p>

<p>Toner does not smudge or run like ink, making it possible for the printer to reproduce very fine details and small print. Even the best inkjet printer has a limit after which small print becomes an inky smear.</p>

<p>Businesses that regularly print high volumes of text materials really benefit from a monochrome laser printer. Laser printers are significantly quieter than inkjet printers as well, a consideration if you're printing in a small, quiet office.</p>

<h2>Cost and the Laser Printer</h2>

<p>The initial outlay for a laser printer is higher than for an inkjet of equivalent quality, but the printer more than pays for itself with lower maintenance costs and longer-lasting cartridges. While a good quality black inkjet cartridge may provide up to 275 pages of printed material, a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Sustainable-Earth-by-Staples-Remanufactured-Color-Laser-Toner-Cartridge-Brother-TN210-Black/product_400717">laser toner cartridge</a> yields up to 2,500 pages before running dry.</p>

<p>Even with toner cartridges costing, on average, more than inkjet cartridges, the extended printing life makes upkeep for a laser printer up to ten times cheaper than for an inkjet.</p>

<h2>Color and Laser Printers</h2>

<p>Color laser printers reproduce color graphics as well as most inkjet printers, making them a good choice for brochures and clip art intensive reports.</p>

<p>On the down side, a color laser printer requires four separate cartridges: black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. By necessity, this increases the size of the printer.</p>

<p>While color laser printers match inkjet image quality in most areas, the inkjet remains the better choice for photo reproduction. A laser printer cannot match the fine color gradients required to reproduce photo-quality images.</p>

<h2>Laser Printer Limitations</h2>

<p>Laser printers have their drawbacks, like any other printer. While it runs quietly, a heavily used laser printer can get quite hot. Some printers produce a slightly unpleasant toner smell during operation, which can become a distraction in a poorly ventilated office.</p>

<p>While new models are increasingly compact, laser printers are larger and less portable than inkjets, which can become a space issue in a small office.</p>

<h2>Who Needs a Laser Printer?</h2>

<p>For any company that prints 500-1,000 text-heavy pages or more a month, a laser printer will speed up the printing process, reduce upkeep costs and produce fine quality printouts. If images and graphics dont play a large part in your printing requirements, a monochrome laser printer costs less than color printers, and will save you even more in maintenance costs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time-management tips are everywhere. We identify the ones that work. Try the following tips to increase your productivity.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<strong>1.    </strong>
<strong>Make meetings matter.</strong> Before you hijack multiple people's schedules, be sure the meeting is necessary. More often than you realize, the topic can be covered just as thoroughly  but more efficiently  via email or a quick one-on-one. If you must meet, set a strict agenda and time limit.</p>

<p>
<strong>2.    </strong>
<strong>Delegate. </strong>Assign critical tasks to the person who can get things done, and then follow up to confirm she does them. If you don't have such a person on staff, rethink your hiring practices. Also, look for ways to outsource jobs like payroll and IT services.</p>

<p>
<strong>3.   </strong>
<strong>Institutionalize it.</strong> Make scheduling, project timelines and time management a part of goal-setting and personnel reviews. Point out underperformance in this area, and reward people for producing on time or early.</p>

<p>
<strong>4.    </strong>
<strong>Track your time.</strong> Take a week to carefully note how you spend your time, and suggest your employees do the same. Review each day's report closely to understand where your time is going, identify problems and explore how to streamline schedules.</p>

<p>
<strong>5.   </strong>
<strong>Unplug</strong>. Establish tech-free blocks of time when you must focus on producing instead of surfing or texting. For several hours each day, stay off the Internet, and mute your phone and put it out of sight. Ask your employees to follow suit.</p>

<p>
<strong>6.   </strong>
<strong>Get Zen. </strong>Research shows that just a few minutes of silent, focused breathing, three times daily, makes a huge difference in concentration and productivity. You don't have to become a yogi, but start your day with a moment of mindful meditation and see if you feel the difference.</p>

<p>Organizing your time begins with you, not the clock. Read on for guidance on how to use your workday hours wisely.</p></blockquote>

<p>We all know and envy the guy who cranks out a ton of work every week and still has time to golf on Friday. Why are some people so much more productive than others?</p>

<p>And why do so many of us fail to produce at a steady pace? Instead of taking a six-week-long project one day at a time, we end up procrastinating, then cramming right up to the deadline.</p>

<p>Let's face it: Everyone has the same 24 hours in a day, but it's clear some of us get more done with them. It's also true that certain circumstances can turn even the worst procrastinators into worker bees. So what's the secret?</p>

<h2>It's All You</h2>

<p>You can try out a number of helpful time-management tips  here are a few we like. But the key to mastering those tactics is stripping away the distractions and delays that keep you from staying on task.</p>

<p>Aim to make your work about you and only you. The first step is learning to close your door, turn off your smartphone and avoid checking email until you've finished the task at hand. Instituting a period or two of "quiet time" each day can do wonders for your productivity.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Think Small</h2>

<p>If you work better under pressure  and many of us do  it's time to start holding yourself accountable on a smaller scale. Take that six-week project, for example. Instead of setting your sights on a deadline a month from now, divide the project into much smaller tasks that you can accomplish in "achievable" chunks. Then pick your first task, get to work and don't stop until you've made your first mini-deadline.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Time-Management Trickle-down</h2>

<p>Managing your time  like managing your business  takes skill, practice and attention. The good news is that as you master time-management skills, you can also share the lessons you've learned with your employees.</p>

<p>Understanding 
<em>your</em> time-management obstacles, and how delays, distractions and other pitfalls work against you
<em>,</em>is at the heart of boosting your performance. Once you get there, you'll see a difference in your bottom line. And who knows? You might even find you have more time for that Friday golf game  or whatever constitutes "play" in your world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We talk tough about the many ways you waste your time  and how can win the battle to be productive.</p></blockquote>

<p>Try as we might, certain time wasters keep getting the best of us. You probably know your main weakness, whether it's watching the stock ticker or taking too many coffee breaks. But some of the other big office distractions might surprise you.</p>

<h2>Web Surfing and Social Media</h2>

<p>Procrastination in the workplace has been around a lot longer than Facebook and Words with Friends. There's a reason, however, that this category comes to mind first: The distraction factor with the web and social media is huge, and almost inescapable. (It's no wonder tech-free spas and hotels are gaining traction; we just can't help ourselves.)</p>

<h2>Disorganization and Electronic Clutter</h2>

<p>Organizing files and emails takes up a huge amount of our time. Technology can help here, since searching electronically is often faster than sifting through piles of paper. Recapturing those few minutes a day lost to disorganization can add up in the long run. Try banishing email clutter first by filing emails using labels or folders. Some email systems (e.g., Gmail) have filtering features that let you bypass the inbox and label or file away certain incoming messages.</p>

<h2>Interruptions from Colleagues</h2>

<p>They may mean well, but coworkers (with their chitchat and even work-related queries) may be what derail you most frequently. Learn to extricate yourself quickly or, better yet, head off interruptions completely. Shut the door when you really need to concentrate, and practice certain key phrases: "Can you put it in an email?" or "Can you delegate that to Joe/Jane?"</p>

<h2>Unnecessary Meetings</h2>

<p>Surprised? Think about it. Sure, meetings are intended to promote collaboration and communication, but it's not often you leave a meeting thinking, That was a really great use of my time. Too often, you're stuck waiting for latecomers or chatting about the playoffs instead of staying on task. Set strict time limits or strive for quick one-on-one check-ins where you stick to the stated agenda.</p>

<h2>Your Smartphone</h2>

<p>That's right  another technological toy that is much more likely to make you inefficient, at least the way we typically use it. This offender combines many of the time wasters listed above, putting them within reach everywhere you go. When it comes to efficiency, uninterrupted time is your friend and technology is (too often) the enemy.</p>

<p>You don't have to become a monk or the office jerk to shield yourself from these distractions. Schedule some technology timeouts every day, and learn to flash a big smile as you politely put off those clamoring for your already-divided attention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Staples Tech gives you the time-management strategies that will make a difference to you and your business.</p></blockquote>

<p>A game-changing time-management plan is one that starts with you and extends to your business and the people who work for you.</p>

<p>Without further delay, here's how to implement one.</p>

<h2>Manage Your Day</h2>

<p>First, prioritize. Start each day with a critical look at how you plan to spend it, and then pinpoint the four or five tasks you really need to get done. If you can, delegate one or more of those to another responsible party.</p>

<p>Set aside a limited block of time in the middle or end of the day for reading and responding to emails and voicemails. This may be the most challenging part of the plan. Stick to it.</p>

<p>Mornings have great potential. Don't waste them. The essential project of the day  the one you're probably avoiding  should come first, when you're focused and refreshed. Decide exactly how much time you'll spend on that top priority.</p>

<p>Close your door, mute your phone, sign out of email and zero in on priority one. Don't stop until you reach your predetermined end time or you can check it off your list, whichever comes first. Then move to priority number two.</p>

<p>Don't stray from your plan. It will take effort throughout your day to avoid getting sidetracked. Practice saying no to requests and interruptions.
<strong> </strong></p>

<p>Review your day. Assess your progress, flag any time wasted and congratulate yourself on what you've accomplished.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Manage Your Business</h2>

<p>Set the tone for superior time management in your business. Whether you're working with a fellow manager, a vendor or your part-time receptionist, set clear, realistic expectations about deadlines, and then hold yourself and others accountable.</p>

<p>Encourage employees to block off periods of uninterrupted work time. Set clear policies about the appropriate use of technology and social media in the office, from PCs to smartphones.</p>

<p>Big projects should be divided into much smaller chunks, then tracked and completed on a firm schedule. Keep meetings to a minimum and only invite the essential players.</p>

<p>You can't always identify a person skilled at time management when you hire her, but it's a topic you should bring up in any interview. Time management is a core skill that any employee should demonstrate, and its particularly important for those who manage others.</p>

<p>When you find you've hired someone with superior time-management skills, tap that person as a resource on the business's big-picture approach to time management, and as a troubleshooter on specific projects.</p>

<h2>Reward Progress</h2>

<p>Implementing a serious time-management plan takes, well, time. Reviewing progress is essential to identifying obstacles and flaws. But rewarding progress is just as important. When an individual or a team makes the grade, be sure to say so. (And if it's you, treat yourself!)</p>

<title>Digital Voice Systems and Conferencing</title>
<description>Combining voice and data systems allows a business to save money while improving communication and productivity.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Combining voice and data systems allows a business to save money while improving communication and productivity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most businesses run their voice and data services separately. The phone provides all the voice services necessary, and a broadband connection keeps data flowing. VoIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol, allows a business to use internet connections for voice services.</p>

<h2>Portable and Affordable</h2>

<p>While not without its drawbacks, VoIP offers real savings to the business with a high volume of long distance calls. PC-to-PC calls through a VoIP network are usually free, no matter where in the world the two computers exist.</p>

<p>A VoIP service usually charges a fee for PC to phone calls, but the charge is much lower than regular phone service. Some VoIP providers offer a flat monthly rate for which a business can make unlimited PC-to-phone calls.</p>

<p>VoIP is also extremely portable. Employees can sign onto the system and make calls from anywhere they have access to a computer, whether in someone else's office, at home or in a hotel half a world away. Many VoIP services also provide cell phone and tablet apps, allowing users to access the network from their mobile devices.</p>

<h2>Voice to Email</h2>

<p>Businesses that chose to merge voice and data systems can arrange to have voice messages delivered directly to employee email. The advantage to this may not be immediately obvious, but voice-to-email systems speed up communication and increase productivity.</p>

<p>Surveys suggest that 75 percent of business people check their email before checking their voice mail. While this allows them to respond quickly to high priority emails, it means all email - high priority or not - takes precedence over important voice messages. By combining the two services, voice-to-email systems reduce response times.</p>

<p>Employees may check email and voice messages several times a day, a process that eats time. Merging the two message systems saves valuable time.</p>

<h2>Size Matters, and Software Helps</h2>

<p>VoIP allows a small business to appear larger than it actually is. Software can monitor a central phone number, and redirect callers to different departments: human resources, accounting, shipping and so forth.</p>

<p>In a small business, one person may be responsible for several of these departments, but the caller doesn't know that. All he knows is that he was redirected to Human Resources. In a world where people often assume bigger equals more successful and professional, this feature helps make a favorable impression on callers.</p>

<h2>Taking Calls on the Go</h2>

<p>Some employees are always on the move, either traveling on business, telecommuting or simply moving around the office. An FMFM option allows on-the-go employees to take calls anywhere.</p>

<p>FMFM stands for Find Me Follow Me. With this option, the employee can specify where and when to reroute calls. For instance, a CEO might have calls go first to her desk, then to her cell phone. Failing that, the software might redirect the call to her home number. As far as the caller is concerned, however, the CEO picked up the call at her desk, because that's the number he dialed.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Conference Calls</h2>

<p>VoIP also allows for multi-party conferences across distances. By adding additional options to the conference call, the voice and data system allows people to share presentations, synchronize calendars and exchange files during the conference.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of Voice / Data Systems</h2>

<p>While combining voice and data services into a single system is often in a companys best interests, VoIP does come with some drawbacks. Chief among these is a reliance on power.</p>

<p>Telephones can still operate during a blackout. The same cannot be said for VoIP. Any interruption in power will bring all services to a halt. Companies that operate in areas where weather or utility issues result in frequent power outrages should consider keeping their regular phone service as an emergency backup.</p>

<p>Running multiple applications on a device can impair VoIP performance. Too many open programs can slow performance and even crash voice services. How big an issue this is depends on the device's capabilities.</p>

<p>Lastly, sound quality can become an issue with VoIP. Most data sent over the Internet is scrambled and compressed, partly for security and partly to increase delivery speed. This isnt a problem with most data, but voice services require real-time responses.</p>

<p>To ensure real-time delivery, a VoIP network will drop some packets of information. How many packets get dropped depends on connection speeds and physical distances, but dropped packers result in moments of silence. When delivery is especially slow, important information can be lost.</p>

<p>
<em>Top tips for capturing an audience's attention and communicating your message.</em></p>

<p>A strong presentation can cinch deals, boost your reputation, expand your professional network and secure investment for an early-stage startup.</p>

<p>That might sound like a recipe for a pressure-cooker situation, but there's no need to be nervous. By following a few simple tips, you can brush up on your skills and create a memorable presentation that leaves a positive impression.</p>

<h2>Public Speaking Prep Tips</h2>

<p>The most important part of any presentation comes before you begin talking. Although improvised anecdotes and comments have their place, most of the presentation should be well-prepared in advance.</p>

<p>Here are some strategies for creating a killer presentation:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Write an outline, not every word.</strong> Reading from notecards or a printed script will limit your eye contact and make the presentation seem drier.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Practice what you're going to say,</strong>
<em> 
<strong>at a relaxed pace.</strong></em> Many people rush through a presentation because they think their audience will get restless otherwise. But people need time to take in the information, so practice your speech with pauses.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Write a strong summary.</strong> What is your one-sentence key message? Determine that boiled-down thought, and then use it as a touchstone throughout the presentation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Have a plan B.</strong> Relying on a PowerPoint deck will be tricky if there's a technology problem or the power cuts out. Maybe you even lose your briefcase on the way to the presentation. Ideally, you should be able to give your talk without any props, graphics or notes if need be.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Storytelling Skills</h2>

<p>Communicating information about a company, service or product is crucial in a presentation, but simply throwing out a string of facts and figures can bore your audience. Instead, amp up the power of your stats and info by weaving them into a story that keeps the crowd captivated.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Company/Customer story:</strong> Case studies are compelling because they highlight common issues and articulate solutions. In a presentation, breaking a case study into a linear narrative can help you communicate information in a way that pulls the listener along and gives the presentation cohesion.</li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> For instance, you can tell the story of "Company XYZ," based on your experience with other clients. First, lay out the problem that the company was facing and how it affected their business. Then, use several slides or presentation points to address how you solved those problems, utilizing information about your company's services. Finally, wrap up with how the company is doing now and a general statement about your role in their success.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Your story:</strong> Even in a professional presentation, audience members gravitate toward a personal approach. Details about how and why you started your company, your own challenges and how you overcame difficulties can be useful if sprinkled into the overall presentation. Be careful, though, not to make the presentation entirely about your company's story unless it's relevant to the material you're presenting.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Their story:</strong> If you're doing a sales presentation, another option might be to take a look at a particular challenge that the potential client is facing. For instance, the company might be struggling with expansion into global markets.</li>
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By mentioning this roadblock and integrating stories of how other companies have overcome similar hurdles, you'll be tailoring the presentation to the audience and giving them useful advice. You'll be viewed as an expert in the subject matter, which gives the presentation more weight and credibility.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Blended approach:</strong> Each type of storytelling can be powerful in a presentation, and you don't have to choose one over the other. Putting them together in some combination can result in an effective, multilayered story.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deck Design</h2>

<p>A good PowerPoint or other deck lets you refer to the slides to communicate information. A common misstep, though, is relying on those slides to do all the talking. Here are some tips on letting your deck shine rather than overwhelm:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Don't overload the slide with content.</strong> Having too many words and graphics will distract audience members from what you're saying because they'll be too busy trying to review your slide.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Choose graphics that matter.</strong>
<em> </em>It might be tempting to throw some stock images into the mix just to have more photos. But unless they relate strongly to your content, leave them out. Otherwise, they might be confusing to the audience.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Write your presentation, then build the deck</strong>
<em>.</em> Your visual presentation should follow what you're going to present, not lead it. Attempting to tailor your talk to a loose collection of slides can make for awkward transitions and a lack of cohesion.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Limit the number of slides.</strong>
<em> </em>Tech pioneer Guy Kawasaki came up with the "10-20-30 rule" for presentations: A deck should have no more than 10 slides, last no longer than 20 minutes and have text that's at least a 30-point font. Although this won't apply to every presentation, the advice is solid: Be concise.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Have fun.</strong> The slide deck doesn't have to be zany, but at least one laugh (particularly near the end) is always appreciated. Especially during longer presentations, a moment or two of levity can be a welcome break. It also helps you end your presentation on a high note.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Standout Handouts</h2>

<p>Even if audience members take notes, they usually appreciate a presentation handout that highlights your main points. Here's what to include:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Top points:</strong> Give them your key message and the presentation's main points. This will serve as reinforcement for what you're trying to communicate.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Slide deck:</strong> If your presentation is shorter (ten slides or fewer), then providing the deck images is a good idea. This allows people to take notes as you go through your materials.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Resources and references:</strong> You don't need to mention these in your talk, but providing links, book titles or printed articles can convey the notion that you're a trusted source of valuable information.</li>
</ul>

<p>With good handouts, a well-prepared talk and strong storytelling skills, your presentation can be a boon to your business. Just remember to communicate your passion, show some enthusiasm and, of course, keep breathing.</p>

<title>Videoconferencing Primer</title>
<description>Today's business owner doesn't need to spend money traveling for face-to-face meetings with distant contacts: videoconferencing brings meetings right to your computer screen.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Today's business owner doesn't need to spend money traveling for face-to-face meetings with distant contacts: videoconferencing brings meetings right to your computer screen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Businesses looking to make important connections with clients, partners and employees increasingly look to videoconferencing. Unlike phone calls, a videoconference allows for a face-to-face meeting without the expense of business travel. Video communication offers additional compelling benefits, including better communication and more flexible hiring practices.</p>

<h2>Road Warriors without Roads</h2>

<p>Travel remains a costly expense for small businesses, but in an increasingly global marketplace it's often necessary to communicate with clients and employees across the country, if not around the world. Even though the modern road warrior uses some impressive tech to maximize her productivity, she's still out of the office racking up travel expenses.</p>

<p>Videoconferencing allows businesses to maintain face-to-face communications while sidestepping travel costs. This alone provides enough return on investment to justify any videoconferencing costs, but it's not the only benefit of meeting online.</p>

<h2>Better Communication through Video</h2>

<p>Today's small business needs to communicate with telecommuting employees, freelance contractors, clients, suppliers and business partners. The bulk of that communication takes place through emails, phone calls and instant messages.</p>

<p>Generally, such communications work quite well, but they all share an important limitation: No one can see each other. This may not seem like a big deal in today's electronic world, but consider this: 80 percent of human communication remains nonverbal. We rely on body language and facial expressions to understand each other.</p>

<p>Videoconferencing allows all parties to communicate clearly by adding these nonverbal cues back into the conversation. Fewer miscommunications result, increasing productivity and preventing misunderstandings. You can share information quickly and more accurately, giving your business a competitive advantage.</p>

<h2>Other Advantages</h2>

<p>Videoconferencing increases a company's reach, both when doing business and when looking for talent. Interviewing job applicants long-distance suddenly becomes viable. You dont need to lose an opportunity to hire a talented applicant because he cant travel to your location.</p>

<p>Come to that, your new hire may not need to come to you at all. Videoconferencing encourages telecommuting, allowing a business to hire talent while saving on office space, utilities and equipment.</p>

<h2>Tech Needs</h2>

<p>Getting started with videoconferencing requires some outlay for technology, but if youre running a business, you probably already have most of the necessary tools at your disposal.</p>

<p>In addition to a computer with a broadband connection, you'll need a headset or microphone. Most computer monitors now come with built-in webcams, but if you lack a camera, you can pick from a range of webcams and accessories.</p>

<h2>Videoconferencing Providers</h2>

<p>It's possible to purchase a dedicated console and video camera for videoconferencing, but most businesses find it more convenient (and certainly less expensive) to use videoconferencing services.</p>

<p>Skype and ooVoo are arguably the most popular choices for videoconferencing, with low monthly fees for multi-person conferences and free one-to-one conferences. These services also allow users to make cheap long distance calls through their computersanother advantage that can save money. Both services provide reasonable image quality.</p>

<p>Adobe Connect has higher monthly fees than Skype or ooVoo, but comes with a 100-user license and customizable interface. If Adobe Connect has a fault, it may be that it provides more features than a small business needs.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that for videoconferencing to work, all participants must use the same service. This makes Skype an attractive choice, as it's one of the most popular services currently available, with apps for smartphones, tablets and PCs. Videoconference services also offer features such as file transfers and instant messaging.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pairing up Bluetooth devices with your work computer can improve productivity and reduce clutter.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bluetooth is a wireless method for transmitting signals over short distances using low-powered radio signals. The signal range is relatively short, creating a PAN, or Personal Area Network, of approximately 164 feet.</p>

<p>You may have used Bluetooth tech without being aware of it. The wireless controllers used for video game consoles use Bluetooth, as do cell phone headsets and many remote controls. The amount of power used to transmit Bluetooth signals is low, so a Bluetooth device has an impressive battery life.</p>

<p>Small businesses can benefit from Bluetooth technology in a number of ways. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=wireless+mice&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home">Wireless mice</a> and keyboards reduce clutter on desktops. Bluetooth headsets allow employees to work and take phone calls simultaneously. Connecting a smartphone or tablet to a Bluetooth-enabled computer allows for quick file transfers without fiddling with USB cords.</p>

<p>Connecting, or "pairing," a Bluetooth device to a PC isnt a difficult task. Do it once, and you'll find a new world of short-range technology at your fingertips.</p>

<h2>Is Your Computer Bluetooth Ready?</h2>

<p>Not all computers are Bluetooth-enabled. To discover if your computer supports Bluetooth, open the 
<strong>Start</strong> menu and select the 
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the Control Panel window, select the 
<strong>Network and Internet</strong> option. Do you see a Bluetooth option? If not, your computer doesn't support Bluetooth. (Note: Bluetooth and wireless are not the same thing.)</p>

<p>If your computer isnt Bluetooth-enabled, all is not lost. You can buy 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Targus-USB-Bluetooth-Adapter/product_857876?catalogId=10051&amp;amp;fromUrl=home&amp;amp;cmSearchKeyword=bluetooth+adapter&amp;amp;cmArea=SEARCH&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;searchViewTypeGridList=listView&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;ddkey=http:StaplesSearch">Bluetooth adapters </a>that simply slot into a USB port.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble pairing a Bluetooth device with a laptop, check the laptop for a Bluetooth switch. Many laptops include switches that toggle Bluetooth capability off and on, and yours might be in the off position.</p>

<h2>Activating Discoverable Features</h2>

<p>Whether you're connecting a Bluetooth-enabled keyboard, mouse, or smartphone to a computer, you need to make sure that the device is "discoverable," or sending a signal that the computer detects.</p>

<p>Some devices are automatically discoverable, while others require changes to their settings. Still others usually smaller devices such as mouses and keyboards have small buttons on their undersides that must be pressed before they transmit Bluetooth signals. These buttons are often small and recessed, and are sometimes hard to find. Check the device's documentation for how to make it discoverable.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Pairing Bluetooth Devices with Windows 7</h2>

<p>To pair a Bluetooth device with a computer running Windows 7, open the 
<strong>Start</strong> menu and select 
<strong>Devices and Printers</strong>. Now click the 
<strong>Add a Device</strong> option.</p>

<p>You'll see a list of icons for all discoverable devices within range of the computer. If the device you want to connect isn't here, one of three things has occurred. You may not have made the device discoverable yet. Your computer may not be Bluetooth-enabled. Alternatively, if you only just made the device discoverable, Windows may need a few seconds to detect it.</p>

<p>Click the device you want to pair with the computer and then select the Next button. The computer may ask you for a pairing code. Each Bluetooth device has a pairing code or PIN. The pairing code is a security feature, so only Bluetooth devices you authorize can access the computer. Your device's documentation should explain how to find the pairing code.</p>

<h2>So Why Bluetooth?</h2>

<p>In case you're wondering, Bluetooth gets its name from Harald Blåtand, a 10th-century Danish monarch who united the Danish tribes. Getting the different tribes to talk to each other was no mean feat. When Swedish electronics company Ericsson developed Bluetooth in the 1990s, they named the wireless technology after Scandinavia's most famous communicator.</p>

<p>
<em>Check out some great tips for finding new customers for your business, including search engine optimization, pay-per-click advertising and social media.</em></p>

<p>Lead generation is the art and science of finding potential customers for your company. Back in the old days, business owners managed this feat by standing on the street corner handing out flyers or advertising in the local circular. With the power of the web, you have many more options today, especially if your customer base extends nationally or even internationally.</p>

<p>How can you locate the most promising potential clients without spamming strangers by the thousands? Read on.</p>

<h2>Types of Lead Generation</h2>

<p>Leads can come from anywhere; there are no rules. Most successful companies use more than one channel for their lead generation, on the assumption that the best way to reach people is to cast the widest possible net.</p>

<p>There are many popular strategies for lead generation. Search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click advertising (PPC) and social media like Facebook and Twitter remain perennial favorites. More expensive campaigns might include hiring a professional lead-generation firm. In this column, we'll walk you through every one of these strategies and describe what works.</p>

<h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>

<p>SEO is one of the most cost-effective lead-generation strategies out there. Unlike more conventional marketing, SEO leverages the unsponsored search results that naturally appear when someone runs a search for a given phrase or keyword. These "organic" search results are widely considered unbiased and legitimate, drawing a better-educated and more engaged clientele.</p>

<p>How do you build your site to rise in the search rankings? Focus on what the search engines actually want: great content, lots of information and interesting material that will inspire other sites to link to yours. Remember that by definition, visitors who find your site via the organic results are already looking for what you sell.</p>

<h2>Pay-per-click Advertising</h2>

<p>PPC advertising is most often associated with 
<a href="http://adwords.google.com/">Google AdWords</a>, a popular platform that lets business owners create tiny text-based ads that appear alongside the organic results. You've probably seen these: They're typically four lines long with a link at the end.</p>

<p>Getting strong value out of AdWords takes some experience. The algorithm is designed to reward successful ads that earn many clicks and link to websites that are already well-optimized (i.e., have the kind of content that wins organic searches as well).</p>

<p>The advantage to creating a PPC campaign is that potential leads "opt in" to your service by clicking on the ads, and they come pre-screened in the sense that they are already searching for the right term. This filtering effect helps cut down on the noise you get from advertising indiscriminately to everyone at once.</p>

<h2>Social Media</h2>

<p>Social media has become a hot area for lead generation because it offers a singular advantage: Recommendations from friends mean far more than an anonymous ad or search result. Many people are more likely to check out a business if someone they know has granted it a "like" or mentioned it in a post or tweet.</p>

<p>You can solicit "likes" by incentivizing that button in some way. For example: "Like us on Facebook to receive half off our most popular service." Twitter works in a similar way: A "follow" is considered a tacit vote for your company. But Twitter is even more interactive because the process of tweeting offers you the chance to engage and charm your customers on a personal level, helping build an intimate brand relationship with your fans.</p>

<h2>Lead-Generation Firms</h2>

<p>Does this all sound a bit complicated? You can always spend some money for the privilege of not having to think about any of it. Lead-generation firms are companies that specialize in delivering a certain number of pre-screened leads to you each month  say, 100 names, or 5,000.</p>

<p>Most of these firms work with affiliate networks that advertise your goods and services across the network, and provide forms for potential customers to contact you if they're interested in learning more. This can work well if you're looking for a very specific demographic, like a certain zip code or age level.</p>

<p>The downside with lead-generation firms is the price. Leads are often several dollars (or potentially much more) per head. But if the leads are well-chosen, the upside is a guaranteed stream of contacts and the value of knowing they'll always be there.</p>

<h2>And What About Pounding Pavement, Anyway?</h2>

<p>Of course, you can still reach many people armed with nothing but a flyer and a dream. Local businesses often see great results by networking relentlessly with other companies in their area  think trade shows, seminars, bulletin boards and the local chamber of commerce.</p>

<p>Despite the scale of the web, there's simply no substitute for meeting another business owner face to face and taking the measure of her passion and expertise. These leads are especially valuable because they come with an actual relationship already established, which is really what online lead generation ultimately is striving to achieve.</p>

<h2>Grab the Lead</h2>

<p>Remember: The lifeline of any business is its flow of customers. Finding those people, arousing their interest and closing the sale are the keys to consistent growth.</p>

<p>Zeroing in on the most-promising potential customers means reaching out and developing ever-better ways to focus on your ideal customer. Check out the search terms people use to find you already, query your existing customers about how they heard about you and look at your books for any patterns. Often a bit of basic research can give rise to an entirely new and successful lead-generation strategy.</p>

<title>What to Look for in a Great Business Headset</title>

<![CDATA[
<blockquote>
<p>Employees need both hands free to work when talking phone calls. Solve "Telephone Neck Syndrome" with hand-free headsets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your office may hide a lurking threat, slowly increasing your employees' risk of work-related injuries and insidiously sapping their productivity. The danger lies on almost every desk, and most of us use it every day. We're talking about the innocent-looking phone. Simply switching from traditional phones to headsets can improve efficiency and prevent chronic injuries.</p>

<h2>The Phone? Really?</h2>

<p>Before you dismiss the idea of the phone as a workplace hazard, consider how most office workers use the phone. In most cases, they're not just having a phone conversation: theyre taking notes, reviewing documents or checking information on their computers.</p>

<p>Such tasks are easier to perform with both hands free, so employees inevitably assume the "phone-crunch" position, squeezing the phone between the ear and a scrunched-up shoulder. To hold the phone in this hands-free position, the shoulder and neck muscles have to contract for an extended period, causing sore necks, backaches and headaches.</p>

<p>Phone-related injuries are common enough that medical professionals call the condition Telephone Neck Syndrome (TNS). In addition to causing aches and muscle spasms, TNS compresses the spines vertebrae laterally, increasing the risk of a serious spinal disc rupture.</p>

<h2>Hands-free Headsets and Productivity</h2>

<p>Many businesses notice an increase in productivity when they switch from traditional phones to hands-free headsets, and research backs up those observations. According to the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, CA, headsets reduce muscle tension in the upper back, neck and shoulders by up to 41 percent. Headset wearers assume more ergonomic sitting positions, take fewer breaks to stretch out sore muscles and handle higher phone call volumes.</p>

<h2>One Ear or Two?</h2>

<p>Headsets come in one-ear and two-ear designs. A 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Sennheiser-CC520IP-On-the-Ear-Headset/product_800254">two-ear headset</a> is well suited to employees who handle high call volumes, such as receptionists and call-center operators. The design is generally more comfortable to wear than a lopsided one-ear headset, which can slide and requires adjusting more often.</p>

<p>Wearing a two-ear headset drowns out office noise, so users can focus on the caller. This feature has a downside, however; it's more difficult for co-workers to gain the attention of someone wearing a two-ear headset. If you need to switch your focus from phone calls to the surrounding environment frequently, a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Plantronics-H41N-Mirage-Headset-w-Noise-Canceling-Mic/product_391547">one-ear headset</a> is probably your best option.</p>

<h2>Noise Reduction and Productivity</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Plantronics-Audio-350-Ultimate-Performance-Headset/product_713475">Noise-reducing headsets</a> block out surrounding noise, letting the employee focus on the task at hand. While useful for phone calls, some offices find noise-reducing headsets help increase productivity in other tasks, as the headsets can block almost 75 percent of surrounding noise.</p>

<p>Some businesses use noise-blocking headsets to give employees a sense of privacy in an open-office setting. The headsets allow users to ignore the steady stream of distracting noise generated by even the quietest office.</p>

<h2>Working the Wireless Headset</h2>

<p>While more expensive than wired headsets, wireless headsets are well suited for employees on the go, either in or out of the workplace. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=wireless+headsets&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home">Wireless headsets</a> come in both one- and two-ear designs, but in this case, a one-ear headset is considered the better choice. If youre up and moving, you need an awareness of your surroundings.</p>

<p>When purchasing a wireless headset, consider range, comfort and battery life. A good headset allows you to wander more than 350 feet from your computer or phone, and has sufficient battery power to run for a whole workday. Some models allow for multiple headsets, so you can carry out conference calls from all over the office.</p>

<title> 5 Easy Ways to Save Paper Without Skimping </title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Each year, 71 million tons of paper products are used in the United States. As we are now better informed on ways to reduce the impact on our environment with our day-to-day living, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Recycled-Paper-Copy-Paper-Printer-Paper/cat_CL141400">saving paper</a> has become an important subject of discussion. There are a few things to be aware of when considering how to save paper. With the assistance of technology and a more frugal mindset, you will find that saving paper is easier than you might have first thought. Being aware of how your workplace runs and informing staff on more effective practices will bring about more positive changes.</p>

<p>
<strong>Fitting More into the Page</strong></p>

<p>When formatting content in a document, filling all of the available space is one way to save paper. Using a smaller font size as you're putting together letters, notices, and essays enables you to fit more text on a page. The text should be large enough to be read comfortably, but it doesn't have to be overly large. Apart from saving 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Copy-Printer-Paper/cat_CG10">paper</a>, the chances of additional pages going astray will be reduced.</p>

<p>
<strong>At the Photocopier</strong></p>

<p>Usually, most of us copy things on just one side of the page but this is not always necessary. By copying on both sides of the paper, you could cut your usage in half. Eliminate unnecessary content by copying only what is essential. If an image doesn't need to be printed, cut it out before copying the rest.</p>

<p>
<strong>Communicate Using Paperless Technology</strong></p>

<p>Today, there are more ways to communicate than ever before, and taking advantage of technology is wise. Instead of sending memos or short messages using paper, save paper by sending send them via text message, by a telephone call, voicemail, email, or through an office intranet. These methods are helpful in reducing the amount of paper used, are more efficient in terms of delivery, and are less time consuming.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cycle of Recycling</strong></p>

<p>There are more ways to recycle than just throwing used paper into the recycling bin. Always recycle paper by using it again before disposing of it. To save more paper, use the backside of letters and correspondence for notepaper, or use it to photocopy on the side that is blank. Making your own notepads helps reduce costs of additional paper and is good for the environment.</p>

<p>
<strong>Choose Recycled Paper</strong></p>

<p>Paper is a product that can be recycled repeatedly. Using recycled paper in your business has lots of positives. Purchasing recycled paper saves forests and the natural habitats of countless animals. In addition, saving and recycling paper reduces landfill. If your company purchases recycled paper, consumers and clients will appreciate that your business is green, and it will give a positive sense of responsibility as a whole. Let your clients and customers know that your company saves paper by advertising that you use recycled paper products.</p>

<p>If your workplace employs these paper-saving tips, the benefits will be many; you'll save paper, time and money, reduce your green footprint, have a more efficient system of communication, be more productive, and contribute to saving the environment.</p>

<title>Why Start Your Own Business?</title>
<description>There are a number of reasons why you may dream of owning your own business. However, in reality, only a handful of people actually end up going into business on their own.

<p>There are a number of reasons why you may dream of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Small-Business-Advantage-3/product_329311">owning your own business</a>. However, in reality, only a handful of people actually end up going into business on their own. If you have ever wondered whether owning your own business is worth it, here are a few reasons why working for yourself is an ideal alternative to working for someone else.</p>

<p>
<strong>Loving What You Do</strong></p>

<p>When you aren't happy with what you do for a living, those negative feelings can often spill over into your personal life. Many people believe that work and a job are not supposed to be enjoyable. However, loving what you do often means less stress and better overall health. People who do not enjoy their jobs often end up feeling negative in their personal lives because of the constant worrying about work during their off time.</p>

<p>Whether you have a dream of making jewelry or working as a freelance consultant, the type of business possibilities are endless. The key to loving what you do is discovering what you truly enjoy doing and deciding whether or not you could do that for a living.</p>

<p>
<strong>Making Decisions on Your Terms</strong></p>

<p>Owning your own business means you don't have to answer to anyone but yourself when you make a decision. When you start a business, you have the opportunity to build it from the ground up. You can make decisions regarding how you want to present the business, how it's run, as well as what direction you would like to eventually see the business go.</p>

<p>Working for other people means you have to abide by their rules. Even if you are a manager, that doesn't mean you have the freewill or the room to make business-changing decisions. However, when you work for yourself, you have the opportunity to do what you think is best for your company. Any mistakes you make are valuable learning experiences and do not come with consequences such as potentially being fired or demoted, as it may be the case with a regular job.</p>

<p>
<strong>Making Money &amp;amp; Flexibility</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Money is often a driving force for many people who start their own business. Working for a company you do not own means you are stuck with the pay that company decides to offer you. However, when you work for yourself, you can make as little or as much money as you want. You do not have a cap on your income, and you can grow your business the way you want to make the amount of money you need.</li>

<li>Working for someone else often means abiding by their schedule. Initially, owning your own business can be time consuming. However, once your business takes off, you end up with a lot more scheduling leeway than you would have working for someone else. For example, if you would prefer to have weekends or Mondays off, there is not anyone above you saying you can't.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to start a business and have a few 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Marketing-Small-Business-Advantage-Premium-Suite-for-Windows-Boxed-CD/product_410295">small business ideas</a>, it is worth it to look into the reality of owning your own business. Whether the idea of owning your own business is appealing because of money, a flexible schedule, or an entirely different reason, there are several benefits that come along with working for yourself.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Whether you're creating a business presentation, writing a school report or simply writing a letter, using a computer allows you to perfect your content and present it in the best way possible. Add wireless printing technology, and you can immediately bring that material from your computer into the real world with just a few clicks of a mouse. Smartphones and tablets have continued in this tradition, offering you significant mobility so that you're no longer tethered to a desktop. Printing out your creations, however, still requires the use of a printer. Despite some differences between printing from a phone and printing from a PC, when you utilize the proper applications, printing should be as easy as ever.</p>

<p>
<strong>Making the Network Connection</strong></p>

<p>Printing from your smartphone or tablet allows you to save time downloading content created away from your home or office to your home or office PC for printing. It also allows you to print from any networked wireless printer.</p>

<p>The key to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Wireless-Printers/cat_CL164737">wireless printing</a> from a Smartphone or tablet is getting the device to communicate with your existing network. In order to do this, you'll need to know precisely what sort of network you're using. Most homes and small offices use a simple local area network (LAN) that includes computers and printers. You'll need to have a wireless network to enable wireless printing options from your mobile device.</p>

<p>Connect your smartphone or tablet to the network using the device's setup options. The connection process differs from one device to another, but connection is fairly simple. Set the device to Wi-Fi mode and wait as it searches for your existing network. Once you've found the network, highlight the network name in the setup menu and type in the requested login credentials. After you connect to your network, you can print wirelessly by selecting your network printer from within the print application, then selecting the print command.</p>

<p>Not all smartphones ship with applications for wireless printing, but third-party applications are available. To use these applications, you'll need to download them with a mobile or tablet device. Once the application is installed, you can launch it on your phone and use the software to send your print commands to the printer.

<strong></strong></p>

<p>
<strong>Printing a Document from your Mobile Device</strong></p>

<p>Most smartphones and tablets already have printing capabilities, but some older models may require installation of new applications to allow successful interfacing with your specific printer. Your printer manufacturer's website will sometimes have applications for use with their printers available for download.</p>

<p>For example, Epson, HP and Brother printers offer apps that allow you to connect to their printers. For iOS devices, you can download Apple's AirPrint and Google Cloud Print allows you to print documents directly from a Gmail or Google Docs account. HP's ePrint-enabled printers allow you to email print jobs from your mobile device directly to any 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/cat_SH136_SH136?d=MzgwJjE1OCZ1cw&amp;amp;jumpid=ot_eassets_us/us/MjU0JjE1OCZ1cw==-home/MzgwJjE1OCZ1cw/StaplesUS/20121112">ePrint</a> enabled printer.</p>

<p>
<strong>The Costs of Mobile Printing</strong></p>

<p>Little to no additional cost is involved in printing from your smartphone or tablet.</p>

<p>Newer smartphones and tablets come with the necessary wireless networking software, and printing applications are freely available from manufacturers. You may encounter a small cost if your older smartphone forces you to use a third-party application.</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Wireless printing helps you expand the functionality of your mobile devices. You can create and print content on the device just as you would on a PC. Wireless printing from the smartphones and tablets is quick and easy after the initial setup process, allowing you to generate hard copies of your documents anywhere you go.</p>

<p>
<em>From vendor relations to supplies procurement, proper office management can keep a company on track. Learn how to build a solid foundation for your small business' operations. </em></p>

<p>With so many clients to acquire and deals to make, small business owners tend to focus more attention on growth drivers than day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>But neglecting operations can limit that growth quickly, leaving you with inefficient processes, unhappy suppliers and a budget-draining logistics situation. The good news is that you can develop a strong operations strategy, and, armed with the right tactics and tools, your business will be more efficient than ever.</p>

<p>In this column, we cover some of the essentials of small business operations. We begin by discussing the basics of office management, move into strategies for better logistics and finish with some tips on strengthening vendor and supplier relationships.</p>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

<ul>

<li>Develop an Operations Plan That Fosters Growth</li>

<li>Ask the Right Questions About Procurement</li>

<li>Manage Inventory Like a Champ</li>

<li>Strengthen Every Link in Your Logistics System</li>

<li>Find Out if Outsourcing Is the Answer</li>

<li>Turn Vendors and Suppliers into Business Partners</li>
</ul>

<h2>Develop an Operations Plan That Fosters Growth</h2>

<p>Many companies grow their operations on an as-needed basis  increasing trips to the office supplies store as employees are added, for example, or doing inventory when product volume seems to be running low. But this creates a firefighter situation, where you're constantly reacting to situations and putting out fires instead of developing and maintaining efficient systems.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Here are three ways to streamline your efforts:</em></p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>Document:</strong> How often will you check inventory levels? What are the costs associated with your current logistics strategy? Are there different payment schedules for each vendor or supplier? Take time to collect all the information on the components of your operations strategy. This type of higher-level view will make it easier to see areas of overlap or potential trouble spots.</li>

<li>
<strong>Delegate:</strong> Designate operations tasks to specific employees. For instance, you might have an administrative assistant check office supply levels and do reordering, while a marketing team could be in charge of inventory control. Ideally, you'd hire an office manager to bring all these responsibilities into one job. Until then, making sure each task has an "owner" provides accountability and consistency.</li>

<li>
<strong>Evaluate:</strong> As operations become more streamlined, they're likely to create change throughout the organization. Better inventory control might increase product manufacturing, for instance. Revisit your original operations strategy on a regular basis so you understand how the pieces fit together as they shift.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Ask the Right Questions About Procurement</h2>

<p>Procurement involves obtaining the supplies and services you need to run your company effectively  ideally in a way that doesn't take too much time away from your day-to-day business.</p>

<p>In a one-person company, procurement often means a quick trip to the office supply store. But adding even one more person to the mix creates the need for more structure and consistency.</p>

<p>Determining patterns of usage can be helpful  make note if youre running out of paper every three weeks or seeing employees using the conference room because they find their desks uncomfortable. For true procurement savvy, however, you need to devise a larger plan for purchasing.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Be sure to ask these important questions.</em></p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>What do you need?</strong> Everyone appreciates a lavish workstation or multifunction photocopier, but keep in mind that equipment and fixed assets represent an investment of capital. Take a long-term view when making procurement decisions and invest in equipment that will give you a strong return on your purchase.</li>

<li>
<strong>How often do you need to reorder?</strong> Some supplies, like paper towels or printer ink will need to be replaced on a regular and frequent basis. Others, like employee PCs, will last longer but have higher replacement costs. Look at the supplies and services you use at your small business and determine how frequently youll need to reorder them based on usage and cost.</li>

<li>
<strong>Who should you use as a supplier?</strong> When choosing suppliers you must look at a variety of factors, the most important being cost versus quality. For example, there may be a local supplier that would reduce shipping costs, but the highest-quality item is from a company across the country. Running a cost-benefit analysis will help you decide which one to go with.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Manage Inventory Like a Champ</h2>

<p>Thanks to cloud-based applications, mobile devices and other technology innovations, inventory management has become more streamlined and efficient for small businesses.</p>

<p>Several software tools, such as Fishbowl, NetSuite and Zoovy, are designed specifically for small and midsize businesses, allowing you to track inventory by the piece, case or carton. Many include capability for adding barcodes, adjusting stock counts, changing product pricing and sending invoices. Look for software that lets you reorder stock easily and generate purchase orders automatically.</p>

<p>Evaluate different software systems based on the type of business intelligence each offers. Although it's valuable to determine inventory levels, a robust application will take you far beyond those numbers into customized sales reports and useful cost-and-profit graphs.</p>

<p>Other important factors to consider when determining which system works for you:</p>

<ul>

<li>Reliable, 24/7 tech support</li>

<li>Short- and long-term affordability</li>

<li>Ease of setup</li>

<li>Access from multiple computers</li>

<li>Transparent licensing</li>

<li>Upgrades as software evolves</li>

<li>Sales staff who understand your industry</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Several free inventory-control applications are available, but be cautious about choosing low cost over high performance. The inventory software you put in place should grow with the company, not represent a just-for-now system.</em></p>

<h2>Strengthen Every Link in Your Logistics System</h2>

<p>Every process in the logistics chain  from buying raw materials to delivering finished products to customers  has its potential weaknesses.</p>

<p>Products may get stored incorrectly, leading to spoilage or damage. Shipping costs may skyrocket as gas prices surge. Production may get delayed through manufacturer error. Understanding each link, and how each fits together, can help you anticipate potential issues and prevent problems throughout your logistics management.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Check out these tactics to improve logistics in your operational strategy.</em></p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Consolidate:</strong> You likely won't find a single vendor to guide your products from development to delivery, but there are areas where one vendor can take on multiple roles. For example, your manufacturing vendor might provide warehouse services and subsequent distribution. Increasingly, logistics companies are offering more sophisticated solutions for supply chain management, taking on duties that were once split among several vendors. Consolidating in this way offers more efficiency throughout the process.</li>

<li>
<strong>Automate:</strong> For small companies that use office space as a warehouse for products, inventory control and distribution are easily controlled. However, as a business grows and develops a more extensive logistics system, automation is key. Whether it's through barcode technology, robust software, mobile applications and/or real-time transportation tracking, putting as many automated controls in place as possible can reduce logistics difficulties.</li>

<li>
<strong>Refine:</strong> Like other areas of business strategy, logistics isn't a set-and-forget proposition. What works this quarter may be too limited or too complicated next quarter. Regularly revisit your logistics components like manufacturing, storage, shipping and invoicing. Ideally, the automation you've put in place will track these areas on a daily basis, allowing you to identify opportunities for improvement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Find Out if Outsourcing Is the Answer</h2>

<p>Logistics is one area of a business where consultants or logistics companies can make a difference. For companies with extensive logistics needs, a reputable specialist can provide strong cost returns in the long run.</p>

<p>Because they consolidate operations  bringing together products from multiple customers into one warehouse, for instance  vendors can provide more efficiency than a company might achieve on its own.</p>

<p>According to industry publication Supply Chain Digest, logistics outsourcing has been steadily gaining popularity with small businesses because it allows them to compete with larger, more automated competitors. Companies can avoid labor issues and reduce capital expenditures through this type of outsourcing.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.scdigest.com/assets/Experts/Holste_10-10-06.php">In a 2010 article</a>, the magazine's material handling editor suggested companies ask several questions when choosing a third-party logistics provider, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>What are you looking to outsource: all or just a portion of your logistics operations?</li>

<li>How do you describe your logistics and company operations?</li>

<li>What are your fixed costs and variable costs for logistics?</li>

<li>If there are service problems, what are they and what causes them?</li>

<li>How will you determine if the provider is meeting expectations?</li>

<li>How do you effectively transition from your own operations to an outsourced one?</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Similar to any major consulting or outsourced relationship, details will make the difference. When evaluating vendors, do your research (including asking for referrals) and determine what you'd like to gain beyond lowered logistics costs.</em></p>

<h2>Turn Vendors and Suppliers into Business Partners</h2>

<p>Questions that crop up in a discussion with potential third-party logistics providers will likely apply to other types of vendors as well. The number of suppliers that focus on small businesses is growing, as IT providers and consultants tap into this market.</p>

<p>The U.S. Small Business Administration notes there are 27.9 million small firms in the country, and about half of all new enterprises survive at least five years. So it's not surprising that many vendors and suppliers are focusing on these potential customers in their sales efforts.</p>

<p>To navigate all the possibilities, here are three ways to choose vendors and suppliers that will work with your company to achieve growth goals:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>Include relevant employees in vendor-selection decisions.</strong> When evaluating a potential warehouse vendor, for example, bring in the accounting department or product developers. Make sure those connections work well before committing to a long-term contract, since any friction could cause issues across your enterprise's operations.</li>

<li>
<strong>Don't ignore chemistry  or lack of it.</strong> It doesn't matter if you're shopping for IT solutions, logistics operations, HR consulting or media relations; every vendor-selection process will involve establishing relationships. Expertise and experience are important, but don't discount gut feelings as well. If the vendor rep annoys you now, just imagine what it will be like after you've spent days together trying to develop a customized plan for your company. Choose vendors and suppliers that are professional and skilled, but also make you feel comfortable doing business with them.</li>

<li>
<strong>Dig deeply into referrals.</strong> A reputable company can provide a list of past customers you can call to verify results. Although these are often satisfied customers rather than disgruntled ones, it's possible to get objective feedback by asking about challenges, problems or unexpected shifts in strategy. Schedule time for an extended conversation to develop an understanding of how the vendor truly changed operations for that customer.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Every vendor relationship is unique, but they all serve the same purpose: driving your company toward growth. Use that mission as a starting point and view their strategies through that lens.</em></p>

<h2>Make Your Operations Leaner and More Efficient</h2>

<p>With proper vendor selection, streamlined logistics and cost-effective procurement, your company's operations can become more lean and efficient. And that can help set up your small business for long-term success.</p>

<em>Starting a business? Don't ignore tax, finance and banking fundamentals. From the ABCs of LLCs to tax-time necessities, this startup guide covers all the essentials. </em></p>

<p>If you're starting a business, making your product or providing your service will be only part of the job. There's also the paperwork: forming the business, paying its taxes and finding the money to run it.</p>

<p>The good news is plenty of help is out there to get your business started on the right foot  and most of it doesn't cost a dime. In this article, we lay out the basics of business formation, taxation and financing, along with useful resources to help you make the right decisions.</p>

<p>
<strong>Before we begin, its important to note that you should speak to a certified legal advisor before making any legal or regulatory decisions. The following article does not constitute legal advice.</strong></p>

</ul>

<h2>Business Formation: What Will Your Business Look Like?</h2>

<p>Once you've decided to become "official," the first choice you'll face is where to incorporate your business. If you plan to do most of your business in one state and do not plan to sell your products online, the easiest course of action may be to incorporate in your own state. If, however, you plan to operate mainly as an ecommerce or web-based business, or pursue venture capital investment or an IPO in the future, it might make sense to incorporate in a state with different regulatory structures. Speak to a legal advisor before choosing where you incorporate.</p>

<p>You next decision is the form your business will take. You may have heard terms like "LLC" and "S corporation" but remain foggy on the details. How do you decide which one best suits your needs? Below, we lay out pros and cons of each.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Sole Proprietorship</strong></em></p>

<p>This is simplest business entity to get up and running. Basically, the company is you and only you. There's little in the way of startup paperwork or fees, and you can run things any way you like. If your work requires licensing or permits, you'll need to comply with local regulations as well.</p>

<p>On the downside, you and your personal property may be liable for any losses or debts your business incurs. For instance, if your sole proprietorship is sued, your personal assets (such as your house) may be at risk.</p>

<p>You and your business are also identical for tax purposes. That is, your business' profits become part of your personal income, whether you use them for a spending spree or leave them sitting in a segregated bank account. It may be hard to get financing for this kind of business, and, as mentioned, you're personally responsible for its debts and any legal liability.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/50-state-guide-establishing-sole-proprietorship.html">Find out the requirements</a> for forming a sole proprietorship in your state.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Partnership</strong></em></p>

<p>What if your business is so successful that it grows beyond your ability to manage it by yourself? By setting up a partnership, you could enlist some partners and share the responsibilities and profits. In most respects, a partnership is as simple to form and run as a sole proprietorship.</p>

<p>Like sole proprietorship, partners and their personal assets are not necessarily protected from the business' debts and legal liability.</p>

<p>A helpful advantage is that a partnership does not pay corporate taxes on profits; instead, partners pay individual taxes only on any compensation they may extract from the partnership.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Limited Partnership</strong></em></p>

<p>This is a sub-species of partnership that carries the advantage of shielding most of the partners (called limited partners) from the legal liability of the business. At least one general partner must remain personally liable, however.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Corporation</em></strong></p>

<p>Creating a corporation increases the separation between you, the owner, and the business, which is now considered its own legal entity. If your business gets sued, chased by creditors or otherwise runs into trouble, your own personal assets are generally safe. Types of corporations include C corporations, S corporations and LLCs.</p>

<p>Corporations require that you follow a host of rules and regulations, which differ from state to state. Plan to set aside time for some paperwork along with money for fees.</p>

<p>In addition, forming and running a corporation involves more formalities than a partnership. For example, you and any co-owners must appoint a board of directors (often yourselves), choose officers and draft bylaws (rules for running the corporation). Fortunately, a wealth of guidance is available online. But remember: Every state has its own procedures.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/50-state-guide-forming-corporation.html">Find out the requirements</a> of forming a corporation in your state.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>C Corporation</strong></em></p>

<p>A C corporation is taxed separately from its owners or shareholders. Unfortunately, that creates a situation that some call "double-taxation." That is, your business is taxed on its profits, and you, the owner, are taxed on any salary you draw from the business.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>S Corporation</strong></em></p>

<p>This type of corporation does not pay a corporate tax on profits generated by the business. Instead, owners or shareholders are taxed as individuals for any compensation they take from the company. As a result, you're legally separated from your business while solving the double-taxation problem.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Limited Liability Company (LLC)</em></strong></p>

<p>LLCs are a popular choice for small businesses. The main reason is that LLCs combine some advantages of a corporation with those of a partnership. You and your business are still separate entities for legal purposes, and you can have co-owners (though you don't need to).</p>

<p>As with an S corp, any profits pass through an LLC untaxed and are only taxed once to you, the owner. There are some papers to file and fees to pay to the state. Also, you should have a document called an operating agreement, which sets out rights and responsibilities of the LLC members. In general, however, an LLC is much easier to form and run than a corporation.</p>

<p>LLCs do, however, have some disadvantages. For example, some investors may be reluctant to invest or take equity in LLCs.</p>

<h2>Taxes: Everyone Pays, But in Different Ways</h2>

<p>If you have a trusted accountant who will assist you with business tax issues, make him earn his money. Your accountant is your best resource for specific tax information. Generally speaking, however, these business tax basics and resources may be helpful.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Employer Identification Number (EIN)</strong></em></p>

<p>Almost all businesses need an EIN, which lets the IRS track wages and other payments made to employees and owners. Sometimes banks use EINs to set up accounts for businesses. Getting one is fairly straightforward and takes just a few minutes  
<a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;amp;-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-%28EIN%29-Online">do it online here</a>.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Deductions</strong></em></p>

<p>"Writing off" business expenses isn't just a time-honored tradition; it's a business necessity. For tax purposes, "business expense" is pretty broadly defined: If you can make a case that a product or service is used in connection with your business in some way, you may be able to deduct that expense from your business' taxable income. Speak to your accountant about the specific deductions you plan to take.</p>

<p>If you do deduct expenses from your business income, you'll do yourself a favor by keeping a solid set of records. Save receipts for everything you plan to deduct. Then enter these figures in a ledger so that when tax time rolls around, you won't have a quarter's (or year's) worth of receipts to sift through</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Tax Breaks</strong></em></p>

<p>Part of handling your business taxes well isn't just knowing how much to pay, but also how much not to pay. A host of tax breaks are available for small businesses. Do you make and sell products in your home? There's a credit for that. Do you provide health insurance for fewer than 25 employees? There's a credit for that. Even something as basic as a net operating loss can help you at tax time.</p>

<p>For the biggest trove of free tax advice, you can go straight to the experts: 
<a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;amp;-Self-Employed/Business-Structures">the IRS</a>. They seem to appreciate how dreadful it is to read about tax law, so their website features 
<a href="http://www.irsvideos.gov/SmallBusinessTaxpayer">video tutorials</a> on dozens of topics, including business income and expense, recordkeeping, retirement plans and more.</p>

<h2>Financing: The Lifeblood of a Business</h2>

<p>Money may or may not make the world go 'round, but it's definitely crucial to running a business. Many young companies don't yet generate the profits or have the customer base to stay afloat, so they rely on financing from outside sources. Below are two common sources of financing for small businesses: loans and equity investment.</p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Loans</strong></em></p>

<p>A sole proprietorship is only as creditworthy as its proprietor, so it can be very difficult to get financing for this simple type of business. A family member might make a gift or loan, but there are tax limits on gifts, and loan agreements between family members can get sticky if things go wrong. In general, it's easier to get outside funding if there's more separation between business and owner, as with a corporation or LLC.</p>

<p>Even during good economic times, getting a small business loan from a bank can be challenging. Lenders are often skittish about making loans to businesses whose owners couldn't pay back the whole thing on demand. This may seem silly, but banks know the failure rate for small businesses is high, and make lending decisions accordingly.</p>

<p>Enter the 
<a href="http://www.sba.gov/">Small Business Administration</a> (SBA), a federal agency that's responsible for increasing lending to small businesses. The SBA does not write loans itself; instead, it guarantees portions of loans made by the lenders it works with. This lessens the risk to the lenders and makes them more willing to take chances on new businesses.</p>

<p>If you're lucky enough to run a business that meets particular criteria, you may qualify for a federal grant. While highly competitive and difficult to qualify for, federal grants have the significant advantage of not requiring repayment. 
<a href="http://www.sba.gov/about-sba-services/7050">Learn more on this topic from the SBA here.</a></p>

<p>
<em>
<strong>Equity Investment</strong></em></p>

<p>Equity investment, which includes venture capital (VC) and angel investment, is a type of financing well suited to companies that can't easily qualify for loans. It's usually a cash investment made in exchange for shares of ownership in and a degree of control over the company.</p>

<p>Control over your business is another important issue to consider. A corporation can be divided into shares; a partnership, not so much. Most venture investors will require documented shares in exchange for their money, which often equates to a say in how the business is run. Ask yourself if you're ready to share decision-making authority in exchange for cash.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that a VC or angel investor is going to want an exit strategy in place even before committing funds to you. Investors want their return at some point, although they're usually willing to wait longer for a business to become profitable than a bank is willing to wait for a loan payback. When it comes time for repayment, however, they may expect a higher ROI than interest on a loan. Exits are usually made when a business is sold outright to another corporation or investor, or becomes publicly traded via an initial public offering (IPO).</p>

<h2>Other Information and Resources</h2>

<p>You may still feel overwhelmed by all the different financial and legal aspects of running a business, and chances are you still have a lot of questions. We recommend hiring an attorney, but some online resources can help as well.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.lawpivot.com">Lawpivot</a> is a legal information website that provides customized answers from licensed attorneys. After entering your question and supplying a few basic facts about your business, you can get answers from multiple lawyers and ask follow-up questions  all for free. This is a great way to get feedback from people who focus on your unique issues.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.nolo.com">Nolo</a> is a long-established publisher of legal manuals and documents. The business has moved into the 21st century with a robust website filled with free information, most of it authored by well-qualified attorneys.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember: Legal information is not the same thing as legal counsel. No online resource will provide the same level of personal legal service, or legal rights, that a licensed attorney can. If you feel you require the advice of a lawyer, both of the above sites offer directories that can connect you with one who makes sense for your issues and your budget.</p>

<h2>Stick to the Fundamentals</h2>

<p>When it comes to your small business, sticking to the fundamentals  formation, taxes and finance  can really set you up to succeed. Make sure you understand what's at stake, and run your business accordingly. When in doubt, seek legal and financial counsel from licensed professionals you can trust.</p>

<![CDATA[
<blockquote>
<p>Food trucks were only the beginning. Seems like everyone has credit-card-reading smartphones on their hips these days. Is the approach right for you? Read on to find out.</p></blockquote>

<p>These days, merchants can accept credit-card payments anywhere theres cell phone service. Thats a real boon to entrepreneurs looking for an alternative to a cash-only business.</p>

<p>However, youll need the right equipment to take advantage of this new technology. Here are some basics to consider before entering the world of mobile payments and smartphone credit-card readers.</p>

<h2>Hardware and Software: The Right Gear for Your Business</h2>

<p>In addition to your smartphone, youll need a credit-card-reader peripheral (most attach to your phone via the headphone port); an app to handle things like taxes, tips and receipts; and a service provider to get the payments from your phone to your bank.</p>

<p>Mobile payment services, apps and smartphone credit-card readers are available for most major phone models. iOS and Android devices are widely supported, BlackBerry less so. In most cases, the card reader and app are free, with the service making its money off of fees. Some popular services:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Square-Credit-Card-Reader/product_486582">Square</a> was one of the first mobile payment services. It features a user-friendly app optimized for iPads (Square Register), in addition to its basic phone app. Square is widely used in retail locations.</li>

<li>
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/credit-card-reader">PayPal Here</a> is from PayPal, a pioneer of secure online payments. Its per-swipe fee is slightly lower than Squares (2.7% vs. 2.75%), and its more widely available than Square.</li>

<li>
<a href="http://gopayment.com/">Intuit</a> offers GoPayment. Like Square and PayPal, it is compatible with most smartphone platforms. In addition, it is one of the few services to support BlackBerry devices on a legacy basis. (New GoPayment software will not support BlackBerrys.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Such a large range of product choices comes with compatibility challenges. Before making the commitment, make sure you confirm whether a particular service and/or card reader will work with your smartphone.</p>

<h2>Banking: Where Does the Money Go?</h2>

<p>Generally, businesses accepting credit-card payments need a merchant account. This is a special type of bank account that works with a processor service to transfer funds from a customers card to the businesss bank.</p>

<p>Mobile card-swiping services, like Square and PayPal Here, often allow you to connect directly to a bank account, eliminating the need for a merchant account. Payments from customers cards are then sent to the account you specify (though the availability of those funds varies among services).</p>

<h2>Costs: Keep an Eye Out for Hidden Fees</h2>

<p>Most popular mobile payment services charge a per-swipe fee of around 2.7%. However, fees for keyed-in transactions (i.e. where the card is not swiped through a reader) are higher  often around 3.5%. Some services, like Intuit, offer a tiered fee system, with lower fees for higher transaction volumes.</p>

<p>Also, dont forget your phones role in all this. Conducting this kind of commerce requires sending data over either a Wi-Fi connection or cellular service. Depending on your phones data plan, overage fees could add up quickly.</p>

<p>You have a lot of choices when it comes to mobile payment technology. Be sure to do your homework and find the service thats right for your business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When disaster strikes, small businesses can take a hit or even go under. Read and print this checklist to keep your company afloat no matter what comes your way.</p></blockquote>

<p>Heres a sobering fact: an estimated 
<a href="http://www.sba.gov/content/disaster-planning">25 percent of small businesses never reopen</a> after a catastrophe. There are many reasons for this problem, of course, but one of the most easily fixed is a widespread lack of preparation among small-business owners.</p>

<p>In this article, well walk you through a simple safety checklist to prepare for disaster and offer advice about what to do if the unthinkable happens.</p>

<h2>Before</h2>

<p>Any good disaster-prep program starts long before the fateful day. Heres what you can do to be ready:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>Purchase disaster insurance</strong>. This may include property insurance, business interruption insurance and even liability insurance. Many small-business owners stitch together a comprehensive safety net out of these coverages to help avoid financial calamity.</li>

<li>
<strong>Back up your data regularly</strong>. Online services like Carbonite can automatically keep your essential files secure in an offsite location.</li>

<li>
<strong>Invest in 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/products/120624/19812/index.html">safety equipment</a></strong>. First aid kits, defibrillators, flashlights and other equipment may allow you to keep employees safe until help arrives.</li>

<li>
<strong>Practice, practice, practice</strong>. Fire drills arent just for school kids  they can save lives. Make sure all your people know where to go, whom to contact and how to conduct themselves in the event of flood, fire, earthquake or hurricane.</li>

<li>
<strong>Make a plan and circulate it</strong>. This is the big one. A good disaster-safety plan should include emergency escape routes, phone trees, contact numbers, special preparation for disabled employees and an agreed-upon meeting place for all employees.</li>
</ol>

<h2>During</h2>

<p>Job One in the midst of any disaster is to secure the people who work for you. Account for your employees immediately, tend to the injured and set your disaster plan in motion.</p>

<p>If youve defined and practiced this procedure, your employees will know right away whos in charge and what their assigned tasks are. Contact the authorities  you should have a list of the appropriate local numbers clearly posted  and move everyone to safety as fast as possible. Only then is it time to call family members to let them know youre okay.</p>

<h2>After</h2>

<p>One of the most important parts of disaster planning is creating a continuity plan (i.e., how youll stay open for business following a catastrophic event). Experts recommend securing an alternate location ahead of time and contacting all the vendors and services that keep you running. These may include banks, Web hosting providers and even material suppliers.</p>

<h2>Rebuilding Following a Disaster</h2>

<p>When the dust clears, your job is just beginning. Recovering from a disaster is no easy task for individuals, but your responsibilities as a business owner range from maintaining revenue to soothing jittery clients to supplying mental-health services if necessary.</p>

<p>The good news is that with this safety checklist, a bit of planning and a level head, you can greatly minimize the effects of any disaster.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be compliant or face the consequences. Such is life in a world with FMLA and other regulations. Here, we take a look at regulations that are relevant to small-business owners.</p></blockquote>

<p>No matter the size or type of your business, chances are youre subject to some forms of regulation. As a small-business owner, the buck stops with you, so you must be aware of all of the regulations with which you must comply. Ignorance is not a valid excuse for noncompliance. In this article, well introduce you to some of the most common federal laws.</p>

<p>
<em>Please note: depending on where youre based, state and local laws may come into play as well. 
<strong>Always speak to a certified legal advisor before making any legal or regulatory decisions. The following article does not constitute legal advice.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Employment Regulations: Keeping Straight with Your Workers</h2>

<p>If you have even one employee, or are planning to hire one, this section applies to you. Among the most important regulations:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>
<a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act">National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)</a></strong>: This law guarantees workers rights to organize. It applies to unionized and non-unionized employees; major exceptions include government employees, agricultural workers and independent contractors.</li>

<li>
<strong>
<a href="http://www.ada.gov">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</a></strong>: This law bans discrimination against disabled workers or applicants in employment decisions, including hiring, firing, pay and promotion. 
<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/index.cfm">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> enforces this law and many other anti-discrimination laws covering age, race, sexual harassment and more.</li>

<li>
<strong>
<a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/index.htm#.UJ1QWWk-vVS">Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</a></strong>: This complex law entitles employees to take unpaid leave without risk of losing their jobs for specific family and medical reasons (e.g., childbirth, caring for a sick family member or serious illness).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advertising Regulations: Keeping Honest with Your Customers</h2>

<p>Promoting your product or service is crucial to the success of your business. You need to do it legally, however; laws governing advertising apply to nearly all businesses.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus35-advertising-faqs-guide-small-business">The Federal Trade Commission</a> enforces advertising laws. Some key FTC requirements for keeping your advertising aboveboard include:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>No false or deceptive claims. </strong>Dont mislead consumers with information (or omitted information) important to their purchasing decisions.</li>

<li>
<strong>Back up your claims</strong>. Have objective evidence to prove what you say. Customer testimonials dont count.</li>

<li>
<strong>Avoid bait-and-switch or deceptive pricing</strong>. For example, no enticing buyers with a low-priced item but selling them a higher-priced item instead; and no jacking up the price of a product so you can sell it for the original price and call it a bargain.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Environmental Regulations: Keeping Your Business Clean</h2>

<p>Environmental laws protect human health and the environment. While the 
<a href="http://www.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> makes and enforces federal regulations, states have their own environmental agencies and rules. 
<a href="http://www.epa.gov/epahome/state.htm">See a list of state and territorial agencies here</a>.</p>

<p>Whether youre subject to environmental regulations depends largely on what you do. For instance, a small house-painting company will need to know how to properly handle solvents and safely remove and dispose of lead paint. A neighborhood auto-service shop will need to know how to handle all that used oil from customers cars.</p>

<p>If your business is subject to environmental laws, youll probably need permits to carry out your work legally. Permits are usually issued at the state or local level.</p>

<p>This gives you an idea of the scope of federal regulations, but its just the tip of the iceberg. As always, theres no substitute for professional legal advice from an attorney familiar with your specific circumstances.</p>

<title>Ensuring Cash Flow with Your Small Business Payment Terms</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether youre a buyer or seller, payment terms are vital for keeping on top of cash flow. Here are some tips for mastering this important aspect of operations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Its just one small line on an invoice, but it means so much to your small business.</p>

<p>Payment terms like net 30 or net 60 specify how many days a buyer has to pay for a sale of products or services. If youre a buyer and your payment terms get set up incorrectly, you might not have cash on hand when a vendor wants payment. As a seller, difficult payment terms can sour an otherwise strong business connection. Set up properly, payment terms will help your small business maintain a healthy cash flow.</p>

<p>Whether youre a buyer or a seller (or both), you can master payment terms with these simple tips:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Know your best terms</strong>: The most common time period for paying invoices is net 30, but net 60, net 15 and even net 10 are widely used in business as well. Before setting a time frame, take a good look at your cash flow to determine what works for you and the business on the other side of the deal.</li>

<li>
<strong>Forge good relationships</strong>: Every business wants to be paid quickly, but short time frames (like net upon receipt) can be onerous for some buyers. If youre the one doling out the cash and the payment terms are becoming tough to meet, ask about tweaking them. If youre a seller, be open to changing the terms if it might foster a better long-term vendor relationship.</li>

<li>
<strong>Dont forget transit time</strong>: Payment terms usually begin the moment a product leaves the seller. For example, if terms are net 30 and a widget takes 10 days to reach the buyer, the buyer has 20 days left to pay the invoice. Understanding this basic math is critical to ensuring that invoices are paid correctly and interest doesnt start accruing.</li>

<li>
<strong>Keep interest penalties in mind</strong>: Unless a vendor specifically grants a grace period, assume that interest will begin accruing one day after the net terms of an invoice. In the widget example, a buyer would be socked with interest on day 31, and it would keep accruing from that point. If this becomes a frequent problem, its worth discussing with vendors to see if they can waive penalties as well as change payment terms.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is that payment terms should be part of an initial conversation between buyer and seller, so that neither side feels slighted. Getting a handle on the best payment terms for your small business can reduce cash-flow issues while strengthening vendor relationships.</p>

<p>Hold on to your best people with these quick strategies for small-business employee retention.</p></blockquote>

<p>Employee retention is a tricky thing for small-business owners. After all, theres always someone out there with deeper pockets.</p>

<p>So how can you get your best employees to stay put? Read on for some quick tips on building a workplace thats happy, healthy and helpful for everyone involved.</p>

<h2>Empowerment</h2>

<p>A growing body of literature suggests freedom is the key to morale. People want to feel appreciated and trusted, and nobody likes to be micromanaged. One easy way to loosen the reins is to allow your people some time to work on passion projects (e.g., initiatives of an intensely personal interest). Another is to give them more leeway in their time management: flex time, a results-oriented work environment (ROWE) or telecommuting.</p>

<h2>Ownership</h2>

<p>A good way to encourage happiness is to have your employees take ownership of the brand with you. Whether this means profit-sharing or simply giving credit and glory where theyre due, the point is the same: small-business employees want to feel like theyre in the foxhole with you. Few forces are more powerful than a shared sense of destiny, so consider implementing group bonuses pegged to performance milestones.</p>

<h2>Healthy Workplace</h2>

<p>Employee retention also requires a healthy workplace, making your employees day-to-day experience safe and enjoyable. Think natural lighting, ergonomic workstations and well-ventilated air. Many small businesses resist making changes like these because of the expense, but investing in a healthier workplace is investing in employee retention.</p>

<h2>Health Care</h2>

<p>A healthy workplace also means providing quality health care. Providing employee health insurance is a proven boon to your bottom line: just under half of small businesses recently reported their companies would be more productive if they provided health care across the board. Beware, however: the ground is constantly shifting under these small-business laws, so its wise to consult a lawyer about the latest credits available in your state.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>Employees are also more likely to stick around if they feel theyre being heard. Take a look at how feedback is handled in your business. Are comments and suggestions offered with respect? Do your people typically end the day feeling belittled, or empowered? Have you deployed a system like 
<a title="Yammer" href="http://www.yammer.com">Yammer</a> or 
<a title="Basecamp" href="http://www.basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> that handles notes, comments and open tickets in a clear way? Many employees would gladly take a pay cut to work somewhere they feel appreciated, rather than earning a few extra dollars but being treated poorly.</p>

<h2>Mentorship</h2>

<p>A final way to make your business into a helpful place: mentorship. Employees work harder and stay longer if they believe theres a credible chance for advancement down the line. You can help foster an environment where productivity thrives by 
<a title="Inc Magazine - Mentors" href="http://www.inc.com/jay-steinfeld/5-ways-to-be-a-better-mentor.html">reaching out</a> to talented people and offering your skills, wisdom and advice. Even distributing tickets to a seminar or dinner can mean a lot to the up-and-comers on your team.</p>

<h2>Keep the Best People</h2>

<p>Your employees are your business, and losing even one integral employee can deeply upset the balance. Strive to create a workplace that places a premium on the three Hs  happy, healthy and helpful  and you should be able to hold on to the cream of the crop as long as your business grows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interest rates are more than just an annoyance on the balance sheet. They can also directly affect the rate at which you can borrow money for your business. Get the scoop on interest rates in this helpful article.</p></blockquote>

<p>You dont need an economics degree to understand the basics of federal interest rates and how they can affect your small businesss bottom line. Here are a few key concepts that you should know.</p>

<h2>Federal Funds Rate</h2>

<p>Banks nationwide maintain their balances at the Federal Reserve (the Fed, sometimes called the bankers bank). To keep their balance sheets straight and comply with regulations, they often lend this money to one another on a short-term basis. When they do, they use the federal funds rate.</p>

<p>The media often imply that the Fed mandates this interest rate, changing it to achieve desired economic results. In reality, the Fed sets a desired target rate, and the banks themselves determine the final effective rate. (Borrowing and lending banks negotiate this fair-market rate among themselves, without involving the Fed.)</p>

<h2>Prime Rate</h2>

<p>The prime rate is the interest rate that banks charge their most creditworthy customers (usually large, stable corporations). The banks arrive at this figure by adding a percentage to the federal funds rate. For example: in recent years, the federal funds target rate has remained between 0% and 0.25%, and banks have been adding 3% to get their prime rate (3% to 3.25%).</p>

<p>The 
<a href="http://www.bankrate.com/rates/interest-rates/wall-street-prime-rate.aspx">Wall Street Journal</a> is a great source for information about the prime rate. It polls 10 of the nations largest banks; when at least seven of them change their prime rate, the WSJ updates its published rate to reflect this new value.</p>

<h2>Your Interest Rate</h2>

<p>The prime rate is meaningful for small businesses and consumers because it is used as a benchmark for rates on many consumer loan products, such as credit cards or student loans. When shopping around for a business loan or line of credit, you may find that banks determine your interest rate (in part) by a) taking the prime rate, and b) adding a margin of a few more percentage points. So if the prime rate is 3.25%, you may be quoted a rate more like 5.25% or 6.25%.</p>

<p>You might think of interest rates like layers of an onion. Your interest rate is often tied to the prime rate. The prime rate, in turn, is pegged to the federal funds rate. When the Fed rate and/or prime rate starts to move, be prepared for possible changes to your interest rate, which can impact your small business.</p>

<title>How Big-Box Retailers Use Local Distribution Centers to Cut Costs</title>
<description>When it comes to distribution, taking a lesson from the big-box retailers can help.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to distribution, taking a lesson from the big-box retailers can streamline your logistics and boost business, too.</p></blockquote>

<p>When leading big-box chains like Amazon, Staples and Nordstrom leverage an army of distribution centers and storage facilities, its not just good business for them. Its also a great learning opportunity for small-business owners.</p>

<p>You dont have to build a massive warehouse or go national to emulate big-box retailers. By applying a few of their strategies on a modest scale, you can see big gains.</p>

<h2>Amazon.com: Continuous Investment in Its Supply Chain</h2>

<p>Although Amazon has many fulfillment centers worldwide, the company recently announced the addition of 18 more distribution centers. This move will lower short-term profits but likely create long-term advantages.</p>

<p>
<em>Tactic to Borrow: Budget for Expansion</em></p>

<p>Amazon is successful largely because it created an extensive distribution network and kept adding to that supply chain. The lesson here: you should see logistics as an area of continual growth, done on a consistent schedule, instead of a goal with an endpoint.</p>

<p>If you have only a few distribution partners now, analyze the changes to your business if you added one annually, or even per quarter. Like Amazon, you may find it affects profits now. But consider whether it might make your business stronger in the years ahead.</p>

<h2>Staples: Focus on Sustainability</h2>

<p>In an initiative called Race to The Top, Staples challenged its product manufacturers and distribution centers to develop stronger sustainability practices. The company aimed to streamline environmental and economic factors to remove waste and inefficiency. For example, bulk shipments helped to reduce packaging costs and make shipping more efficient.</p>

<p>
<em>Tactic to Borrow: Think Sustainability</em></p>

<p>Every business wants to be more efficient, and if distribution is viewed through a lens of sustainability, its easier to streamline those changes. Staples created supplier scorecards that track attributes like shipping frequency and packaging costs. Creating a similar tool will help you to compare distribution centers and see where efficiencies might be realized.</p>

<h2>Nordstrom: Improve Multichannel Capabilities</h2>

<p>Many retailers were experiencing sales decreases at brick-and-mortar stores in 2011, but Nordstrom saw growth. The president of Nordstrom Direct attributed the companys success to changes in its multichannel functionality. For example, inventory systems were tightened so that an online shopper could see products in retail stores.</p>

<p>
<em>Tactic to Borrow: Strengthen Links Between Inventory and Ordering Systems </em></p>

<p>When it comes to distribution, many software applications could be working simultaneously. A company may employ an order management system, for example, while its local distribution center could be running a warehouse management system.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these applications sometimes dont play well together, particularly if others are in the mix, such as fulfillment software and mobile apps for package tracking. Streamline and improve the process by creating a multichannel strategy that relies on just one or two order-management systems.</p>

<p>By borrowing strategies like these from the big-box retailers, you can create a distribution network thats more efficient and ready for growth. Better logistics might even make you into a big player, too.</p>

<em>Give your small business its best chance for success by creating a technology strategy that grows with your company. </em></p>

<p>For most small businesses, technology is an indispensable partner that keeps everything from point-of-sale to marketing to finance running smoothly  as long as all parts of the technology work together like they should.</p>

<p>To minimize any tech-related roadblocks, take some time to create a strong technology strategy that's cost effective, highly strategic and geared for growth. Sound daunting? It doesn't have to be, with effective planning and implementation.</p>

<p>In this article, we delve into some of the major elements of a technology strategy for small businesses. We start with a look at technology planning, move into hardware shopping tips and software functionality, cover networking basics and finish with tactics for backup and security.</p>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

<ul>

<li>Develop a Technology Plan with Room for Growth</li>

<li>Hardware Shopping Tips</li>

<li>Where to Look</li>

<li>Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>

<li>Set Up a Business Network Quickly and Easily</li>

<li>Keep Data Safe and Secure with a Few Simple Tactics</li>

<li>Gauge Your Security Needs</li>

<li>Review the Plan</li>
</ul>

<h2>Develop a Technology Plan with Room for Growth</h2>

<p>The first step in any technology strategy  even before perusing different technology options  is to determine what you need. Although it's tempting to load up on flashy devices and feature-packed software, putting too much into a technology combination could lead to operational inefficiencies and budget strain.</p>

<p>Here are three steps to get started with planning:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Document current usage: </strong>Write down every form of technology you're using now, including cell phones, software, online tools, email clients, data storage, laptops and networking equipment. This will give you a broader view of your existing technology and how those pieces are fitting together.</li>

<li>
<strong>Determine effectiveness: </strong>As you're noting a particular technology component, consider whether that tech works effectively or if you're just "making do" with it. Are you taking more time than necessary to back up data, for example, rather than utilizing a behind-the-scenes solution that does the work for you?</li>

<li>
<strong>Paper to paperless: </strong>Is there a process that's manual now but could be automated, such as appointment scheduling or check writing? Determine the benefits of bringing more of these tasks into the technology mix. For instance, an online appointment scheduling application can also keep track of client contact information, reducing the need for address books and separate databases. Consolidation of tasks and information can significantly boost efficiency, and drive business growth as a result.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hardware Shopping Tips</h2>

<p>Once you've determined technology usage and goals, it's time to choose hardware that will best meet your company's needs. Cost is a major element, but it shouldn't be the only factor in a technology decision.</p>

<p>Be sure to also consider:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Interoperability with existing technology:</strong> One of the most important considerations when developing a technology strategy is how well all the components will work together. One prominent example is the increase in dependence on mobile devices. As more and more employees integrate smartphones and tablets into their working day, they may discover these newer devices do not synch well with their company's legacy laptops, networking equipment or software. Before installing these devices in your workspace, consider consulting an expert on the issue or leveraging the online forums and web sites that naturally support these types of devices.</li>

<li>
<strong>Support services:</strong> More obscure manufacturers might offer technology at a lower price tag, but consider the long-term costs if support isn't part of the deal. Often, it's much better to choose a reputable, known manufacturer with strong tech-support services.</li>

<li>
<strong>Future-proofing the technology mix:</strong> Will the laptop you're buying handle multiple rounds of software upgrades and security fixes? Bringing older or refurbished tech into your company can be smart budget-wise, but make sure the hardware you're buying today will run well tomorrow, too.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to Look</h2>

<p>Take the time to gather information from a variety of sources. According to a 
<a href="http://www.smb-gr.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/pdfs/RTM_RB2.pdf">study done by the research firm SMB Group</a>, 72 percent of small businesses cite vendor websites as one of their top sources of information when it comes to technology solutions.</p>

<p>Social media can also be a boon; the same study found 68 percent of small businesses use blogs and 64 percent view webinars and podcasts when looking for information about technology. Survey respondents also indicated that email newsletters, search engines, LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook were also influential in their decision-making.</p>

<p>In general, culling from multiple sources in this way can give you a wider view when evaluating specific technology components, like a certain brand of smartphone or a line of laptops. Set aside some time up front for this kind of broad research effort and youll soon realize the effort spent now is worth the higher efficiency and profits later on down the line.</p>

<h2>Choose Software Based on Business Function</h2>

<p>Similar to hardware like laptops and desktops, software should be evaluated based on functionality, business goals, interoperability and effectiveness. Here are some top factors to consider when choosing software and making it work for you:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Quick setup:</strong> As a small business owner, it's likely you don't have weeks to discover all the nuances of each application. Look for software that can get up and running quickly, giving you time to learn about features as you use the app.</li>

<li>
<strong>Consolidated tasks:</strong> Running different pieces of software to track expenses, calculate mileage, deliver tax advice, streamline inventory and do other financial chores can leave you running from one part of your hard drive to another. Make a list of all the tasks you do in a certain area, like accounting, and see if there might be an application that ties these tasks together.</li>

<li>
<strong>Appropriate functionality level:</strong> On the flip side of consolidation comes simplification. Some small businesses don't need inventory management or supply chain functionality  they might require only an invoicing program and expense tracker. If that's the case, don't go with a feature-rich (and therefore more costly) software package that delivers unnecessary functionality.</li>

<li>
<strong>Mobile:</strong> Many applications created today may feature a mobile component, which is to say they have a version thats been optimized to run quickly and efficiently on a smartphone or tablet. For a company that's particularly decentralized, mobility could be a driving factor during application selection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h2>

<p>The constellation of small business applications is vast, with free options, cloud-based choices and traditional boxed software. Some SaaS models offer applications on a monthly or annual subscription basis; pricing depends on the number of users and the amount of data stored.</p>

<p>SaaS is likely to keep growing in the small business community. 
<a href="http://www.ami-partners.com/index.php?target=news&amp;amp;mode=details&amp;amp;news_id=233">Recent research from AMI Partners</a> determined that usage of SaaS-based customer relationship management (CRM) software among small businesses will triple by 2015. AMI Partners estimates that over 500,000 U.S. small companies are using SaaS for their CRM needs now.</p>

<p>The benefits of a SaaS approach hit all the top factors for software selection: Often, companies can choose only the functionality they need, access is available to mobile devices and many SaaS applications offer consolidated tasks. When considering your software blend, be sure to consider these types of applications as well, in case they make sense for your business, too.</p>

<h2>Set Up a Business Network Quickly and Easily</h2>

<p>With today's business communications, as well as online applications, technology is woefully less effective without an Internet connection. Here's what you'll need to set up a solid wireless business network:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>The Router:</strong> Because so many office devices (e.g. scanners, laptops, photocopiers) can benefit from wireless technology, many small business owners choose to create a wireless network. For this, you'll need a wireless router, a small device that takes the signal from the network and broadcasts it over a certain area. To get the most of the connection speeds offered by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), look for routers that operate on the 802.11n wireless standard.</li>

<li>
<strong>The Modem:</strong> The modem helps deliver that wonderful digital signal from your ISP to your home office or place of business. You can always buy your own modem, but almost all ISPs will supply one that fits whichever data plan you purchase from them.</li>

<li>
<strong>No wireless? No problem: </strong>Network cables, also called Ethernet or Cat 5 cables, are basically insulated connections that physically link your computer or peripheral to whatever source you're using for Internet access. You can use these cables to plug a computer directly into a network source or to hook up peripherals to a wireless router.</li>
</ul>

<p>The benefit of a wired approach is straightforward (a faster connection speed), but doesnt mean as much as it once did given the strength, mobility and reliability of todays dual-band wireless routers. If you can help it, go wireless. The wired approach may give a speed boost, this is true, but it comes at a cost: youre sacrificing the efficiency, maneuverability and potential productivity boosts that a modern-day wireless setup provides (and no coffee shop working sessions, either).</p>

<h2>Keep Data Safe and Secure with a Few Simple Tactics</h2>

<p>All the technology savvy in the world won't be enough if your data gets wiped out.</p>

<p>According to the 
<a title="Global Disaster Recovery Index" href="http://vmblog.com/archive/2012/02/14/acronis-releases-a-2012-disaster-recovery-index-report-and-infographic.aspx" target="_blank">2012 Global Disaster Recovery index</a> from IT services firm Acronis, 23 percent of small businesses lack a remote backup strategy, and 42 percent still use manual, antiquated backup procedures (e.g., transferring new files onto an external hard disk). Only 21 percent of small businesses in the survey deploy cloud backup solutions.</p>

<p>Researchers noted that these numbers were similar to 2011, even though small business owners surveyed realized the importance of data backup.</p>

<p>Don't let your business become a statistic. Although data backup can seem like a tiresome chore, a number of technologies can make the task easier. Here are a few main options:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>Cloud-based backup:</strong> Many small businesses are turning to the cloud because it offers ample storage without steep costs. Think of a public cloud as an online self-storage unit  your data is routed to a secure rented space, where it benefits from shared resources. If you're concerned about security because you have a great deal of highly confidential information, consider a private cloud, which resides within the company's firewalls.</li>

<li>
<strong>Physical storage: </strong>Some small businesses have limited data, which they want to physically retain. In those cases, traditional storage mediums like external hard drives, DVD-ROMs, CDs and USB thumb drives can be inexpensive ways to store smaller amounts of data. For a bit more room, backup tape libraries can also be useful. With tapes, offsite storage is easy, since you simply pick up the tape and bring it home. We should note that each of these approaches carries an obvious security risk: theft and tape damage are as easy as leaving something in a cab or spilling a coffee. Be careful out there.</li>

<li>
<strong>Backup software:</strong> Numerous software packages offer automated backup, recovery features, reports on data usage and other functions. Some of these applications feature "one-click backup," which means an entire system can be backed up with a single mouse click.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whichever option you choose, make sure to utilize it and plan for regular backups. Automated services and software can help keep a small business on track, and out of danger.</p>

<h2>Gauge Your Security Holes</h2>

<p>A firewall and some antivirus software were once all it took to consider a shop secure, but not anymore. In the modern digital age you need to evaluate every facet of your businesspeople included. In every aspect of a technology strategy, security should be a driving factor when it comes to purchasing and implementation.</p>

<p>Consider poor password policies, for example. Year-after-year countless independent reports reveal that the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-most-unsafe-password-choices-of-2011.html">most-used poor password is, well, the word password.</a> The numerical phrase 123456 is often a close second, revealing that for many small businesses, the biggest security threat is often its own employees. Dont be too hard on them, however. Sometimes all a workforce needs to create better passwords is a little advice.</p>

<p>For example, choose a string of text thats easy to remember, like a line from the 
<em>Pledge of Allegiance</em>. I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of America has a nice ring to it, and if we take the first letter from each word, we get Ipattfotusoa. Ugly word, yes, but its a great 12-character, seemingly random password. Take it a step further if you like and sub in some numbers: I1p2a4t3tOf. Thats pretty ugly too, but its the kind of ugly you can remember, and the kind that a hacker would pass up for something easier to crack. Like, say, 123456.</p>

<p>Beyond your people, its important to look at each piece of equipment in the office (even the printer, if it's wireless-enabled) and set security controls or install the latest antivirus program, if possible. These controls are often found in the user manual that accompanies the device, but in rare cases where the manufacturer has not included them, or the instructions appear to be written in another language, contact a tech professional for help.</p>

<p>Most antivirus programs, once installed, will update automatically, thereby ensuring your PC or tablet has the most up-to-date protection no matter how forgetful you might be with that kind of thing. New malware launches every day, so having an autonomously updating antivirus program on your device is an invaluable tool we really cannot promote enough.</p>

<p>Lastly, take a look at automated security tools, such as those found with data-backup software and services. These tools can also run their own regular antivirus and intrusion protection sweeps on a system and send an alert via email or even text message to let you know when something seems awry. Thats more time for you to worry about things that really matter, like your bottom line.</p>

<h2>Review the Plan</h2>

<p>As your company grows, it's likely that your technology needs will change. Creating a technology strategy that anticipates this growth will go a long way toward minimizing expenditures and technical issues. Of course, be sure to review your technology mix on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Also set aside some time at least once or twice a year to evaluate your hardware, software, networking gear, backup and security, and determine if all those components are still meeting your needs. When doing this review, project a year into the future, when you'll likely need more storage space or be managing more company growth. Planning for a certain level of expansion will help keep your technology mix at the right level.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p align="center">
<strong>In a tough economy, there seems to be a beacon of hope.</strong></p>

<p>This hope stems from the world of small businesses, people who start a new company in a trying economy. Alfonso Santaniello, Business Owner and Marketer, knows exactly what a grim future looks like, but he also knows what just three years can amount to. Back in August of 2009, Alfonso set out to prove wrong all those who told him the economy would never support his dream.</p>

<p>Now owner of Creative Strategy Agency, Alfonso sat down with us here at Staples and told us just what it took to start his own small business.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: How long have you owned your business and what was the inspiration behind starting your business?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Ive owned the Creative Strategy Agency for three years. It all started when I decided that my main goal was to help companies succeed through successful marketing initiatives. Passionate business owners have always been my inspiration and helping them reach their marketing goals is what truly continues to inspire me every day.
<span style="font-size: x-small;">    </span></p>

<ul>

<li>Q: Was finding startup capital difficult in the beginning?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Yes, but it was a slow build. Whatever I had at the time I invested and as time progressed, the more I had the more I invested. Each step was small, but it was successful because I was realistic with what my goals were. Each time I was able to put more into my company it was a great accomplishment.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What does it take to own your own business?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Its a 24/7 job. Even when youre away you have to be accessible for the first few years. Until you have enough people in your company to help you answer your customers questions you have to be ready to be there. Another aspect of my personality is the fact that I am extremely passionate about my clients and what creative asset will work best for them. Honing into this has helped me best serve the needs of each individual client.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What advertising methods do you use?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: I use a submissive type of advertising. With this, I am able to get my face and name out there for potential clients by self-promoting at networking events. With word of mouth from past customers and positive feedback, my company has soared. In my initial attempt to help small businesses through my company I ran Webinars. These Webinars not only helped other small businesses, they helped me as a provider to know what small businesses needed most. I also found the key to having a successful advertising plan was to listen to the customer and make sure that loyalty was the number one factor.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What percentage of customers comes from the local community vs. Web based?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: For my company, most business comes from networking and word of mouth, loyal customers and a small amount come from the Web. My clients are my best form of advertising! When Im out at events Im not only able to share who I am, Im able to share what I do. Being a sponsor of local community events also really helps my company. Im currently a part of Young Professionals of Greater Springfield where we put on monthly events for young professionals of the surrounding Massachusetts area. My belief is to keep the younger demographic and business owners in the loop of whats going on in the business world. There are currently a few hundred members and the group is growing.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: How important is support during the time of starting your own business?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Support from my family and friends has helped to really escalate my success. This support helps you on days that owning a small business is challenging. At the end of the day, its not the number of clients you have, its the number of lasting relationships you have with customers that will make the difference. Communication is what helps keep my business where it is, and learning how to communicate the best way starts with your own personal relationships.</p>

<ul>

<li>Q: What advice would you give someone who wants to start their own small business?</li>
</ul>

<p>A: Make sure to research and plan. Know what your strengths and weaknesses are and know exactly what everyone else is doing in your profession. The intent for this is so that you can try and do it better. It took me a good six months of planning and researching before I even started to think about it.</p>

<p>Use the proper products to track facility budgets for smaller businesses and control costs.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Facility Budgeting Tips for Smaller Businesses</strong></p>

<p>As owners of small- and medium-size businesses look for cost-effective techniques that will keep them competitive in today's market, facilities maintenance becomes a crucial area for budget examination. The cost of labor, equipment and tools, and supplies to meet regulatory standards and customer expectations can be high-ticket line items, but are controllable to some extent. However, owners of smaller businesses need solutions that do not require more employees or large cash outlays.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Meeting Standards and Expectations</strong></p>

<p>All business must comply with a long list of federal, state, and local regulations that include 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/management+software/directory_management+software">facilities maintenance</a> standards for cleanliness, environmental concerns, and safety. In addition, customers want your business place to adhere to these rules, and many will judge your facility as to its state of repair. After-the-fact compliance to governmental rules can involve fines, and a loss of clients reduces income. Depending on your type of business and other factors such as the facility's age, geographic location, and power and fuel consumption, the percentage cost of maintenance against your bottom line can range from modest to excessive.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Managing Facilities Maintenance</strong></p>

<p>Despite the push to develop e-commerce sites, many businesses must still retain brick-and-mortar facilities even if they are only warehouses or computer centers. Managing these facilities can be an expensive proposition when profit margins are thin. Before you can determine if and where cost savings in facilities maintenance are possible, you must first assess how much money you are spending in different areas. Proper tracking mechanisms are essential.</p>

<p>As a business owner, you should know how much is being spent on the items that comprise facilities maintenance: employee labor, equipment and tools, and supplies. In fact, the categorization of these costs can be especially useful during tax preparation if special deductions apply (e.g., environmental tax credits are given for equipment that is energy efficient). By purchasing 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/accounting+software/directory_accounting+software">budgeting software</a>, you can simplify the scrutiny of facilities maintenance and other financial tasks. Financial or accounting software often costs less than $200, and represents a small investment with a high return in comparison to manual bookkeeping. After initial setup, this type of computer tool offers rapid workflow through many features. Entries can be automatically entered on a predetermined schedule, memorized transaction inputs limit information keying, and budget alerts flag overspending in specific categories. In addition, other 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/management+software/directory_management+software">maintenance management</a> duties, such as tracking employee time on clean-or-repair assignments, can be tracked through electronic timecards or scheduling software. Use of this software, when coupled with Internet resources, can ensure that the lowest priced equipment, tools, and supplies are always being purchased.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The key to facility budgeting is identifying, quantifying, and monitoring the line items associated with facilities maintenance-labor, equipment and tools, and supplies. The use of computer software designed to perform those functions is probably the best approach for the owner of a smaller business, who must often operate with limited resources.</p>

<em>Your brand is one of your small business' most important assets. Learn how to establish your brand  and how that can help you promote your business, build loyalty and become profitable. </em></p>

<p>Your small business doesn't need to be a world-famous household name in order to have a strong brand.</p>

<p>There's more to your "brand essence" than just your logo and a snappy slogan. Your brand is the entire sum of what you do, what you excel at and the experience your customers have with you. It determines whether customers join your loyalty club and refer you to friends  or don't bother with you again.</p>

<p>In this article, we offer guidelines for building a strong brand that positions your small business clearly and effectively in the marketplace, and helps attract repeat business and referrals.</p>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

<ul>

<li>Know Specifically Why You're in Business</li>

<li>Clearly Define Your Brand Promise</li>

<li>Target Whom You Want to Serve</li>

<li>Be Honest and Authentic About Who You Are</li>

</ul>

<h2>Know Specifically Why You're in Business</h2>

<p>In todays competitive marketplace, you dont want to be a jack of all trades, master of none. While it may be tempting to offer clients a wide menu of products and services, its important to keep your brand focused.</p>

<p>Specializing in one thing allows your small business to stand out in the market. Being an expert in what you do, and doing it better than anyone else, helps the marketplace see you as the #1 source.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>Your customers have specific needs, wants, values and characteristics. Ensure your brand lets them know you understand them, and can serve and satisfy them. </em></p>

<h2>Clearly Define Your Brand Promise</h2>

<p>Your brand promise is powerful. It's the statement you make to your customers and target audience that lets them know what to expect every time they interact with you and your employees, products and services.</p>

<p>A brand promise is based in reality, and it's something you can prove. It's grounded in your company's culture, philosophy and atmosphere. It reflects how you serve your customers and deliver value to them. How you make a problem they have go away. How you make their life better. Why they can't do without you and would never go anywhere else.</p>

<p>If you were to try to think about what these famous brands promise, you might come up with something like this:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>McDonald's:</strong> fast food with a consistency of taste and service, whether you walk into one in Timbuktu or Toledo</li>

<li>
<strong>Starbucks:</strong> quality coffee in an inviting, casual atmosphere  your living room away from home</li>

<li>
<strong>Volvo:</strong> cars that offer both safety and luxury</li>

<li>
<strong>Zappos.com:</strong> any shoe you could want, backed by amazing customer service</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything you do to market your small business should reflect your brand promise.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>Need help defining your brand promise? Complete this sentence: "My customers buy from us because we're the only one that " The more specific the answer, the clearer your brand promise will be.</em></p>

<h2>Target Whom You Want to Serve</h2>

<p>As discussed above, your small business can't do everything; likewise, it probably can't serve everyone. Daycares serve parents and families. Guitar stores serve certain musicians. Obstetricians serve expectant mothers. You need to know who your customer is in order to offer what they need.</p>

<p>Your customers may skew toward certain demographic or socioeconomic groups. They may share a particular problem, interest or need. Your brand needs to connect with these people. They're your target audience: the consumers you specifically aim to serve.</p>

<p>If you don't know who your target audience is, use your existing customers to define some parameters. While you may know the "80/20 rule" (i.e., 80 percent of your business comes from 20 percent of your clientele), this may provide too wide a sample.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>To define your target audience, "go with the top 10 percent </em>
<em>of your customer base," advises Sandy Upham, president of </em>
<em>Wright Marketing Workshops</em>
<em>. They're the ones who are already engaging repeatedly with your brand, avidly believing in your promise and delivering the greatest value to you.</em></p>

<h2>Be Honest and Authentic About Who You Are</h2>

<p>Your brand has to talk the talk and walk the walk. Otherwise, you'll present yourself inconsistently and confuse the marketplace.</p>

<p>If you've clearly defined your audience and what sets you apart, authenticity should come easily. Don't be hip and casual if that's not who you are, or if that's improper for the service you provide (e.g., a funeral home).</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip:</em></strong>
<em> When it comes to your brand, be consistent and genuine. That will make it easier to build trust with your customers, connect with them and do repeat business.</em></p>

<h2>Differentiate Yourself from the Competition</h2>

<p>Knowing what you do best and being able to convey that to your target audience means knowing what you're up against.</p>

<p>With that in mind, you must be aware of your strengths 
<em>and</em> your weaknesses. Learn how to accentuate the former and how to address the latter  or, even turn those weaknesses into positives. For example, if you're a restaurant far away from Main Street, can you position yourself as a beloved "neighborhood place" for foodies in the know (and with easier parking)?</p>

<p>Your brand also needs to have some glimmer of personality. Consider what happened to the search engine formerly known as AskJeeves.com. When it launched in 1996, the brand was represented by a logo depicting a proper English butler. In the pursuit of concision, the company name later was shortened to Ask.com. Jeeves was fired from logo duties in 2005.</p>

<p>Four years later AskJeeves still had a brand awareness of 83 percent, compared to Ask.com's 72 percent, and the butler was brought back into service. The lesson? Celebrate rather than suppress what makes your brand different.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip:</em></strong>
<em> What do you do better than everyone else in your space? Focus on that.</em></p>

<h2>Keep Your Messaging and Visual Identity Professional and Consistent</h2>

<p>From business cards and logo to email newsletters and brick-and-mortar signage, all of your printed communications and sales materials should look, feel and sound like they come from the same source.</p>

<p>In terms of messaging, reuse key phrases that are your unique selling points, whether they're used in your brochure, on your website or in ads. Put your company slogan or tagline on everything  it's your brand promise boiled down to a catchy, memorable phrase.</p>

<p>Ideally, your brand's visual appearance and messaging:</p>

<ul>

<li>Reflect your brand's personality and voice.</li>

<li>Set you apart from the competition.</li>

<li>Appeal to your target audience.</li>

<li>Command attention.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip:</em></strong>
<em> Don't have the right skills in-house? Explore hiring a professional copywriter and/or graphic designer to help with your marketing collateral. Projecting an unprofessional image will only discourage people from doing business with you.</em></p>

<h2>Create a Dialogue with Your Customers</h2>

<p>Sure, you talk to customers when they come in, call or email. That's a conversation. But conversations end. Dialogues are ongoing.</p>

<p>How can you be interacting with customers even when they're not doing business with you? Here are some ways to stay top-of-mind:</p>

<ul>

<li>Post video demos of your products or services to your website, Facebook page or YouTube.</li>

<li>Put a poll on Facebook. It doesn't need to be related to your business (e.g., ask them what movie they're going to see this weekend).</li>

<li>Solicit product reviews on your website and on websites where your products are sold.</li>

<li>Respond proactively and professionally to Yelp! or Angie's List reviews, especially the negative ones.</li>

<li>Hold customer appreciation events so they see you in a new context; people love to know that they matter.</li>

<li>Share useful information; don't just send advertisements.</li>

<li>Send email newsletters targeted to your customers interests or purchase histories.</li>

<li>Share testimonials of satisfied customers.</li>

<li>Utilize customer satisfaction surveys.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip:</em></strong>
<em> Following these bullets will minimize the time your business is "out of sight, out of mind" with customers. </em></p>

<h2>Give Customers a Great Experience at Every Point of Contact</h2>

<p>In our digital age, its both easier and harder than ever to reach your customers. Theyre only a click away, but they may never meet you face to face. Make customer service a core value at all levels of your business, and become known as a brand that delivers a terrific experience. Your customers will reward you.</p>

<p>The first thing car-sharing company Zipcar does when its customers report 
<a title="Humanity drives loyalty" href="http://www.rightbrainbrands.com/humanity-drives-loyalty" target="_blank">they've been in an accident?</a> Ask them if they are safe and in a warm place. Think of everything you do in terms of customer service, even if you're not directly dealing with customers. Consider the impressions they get when they:</p>

<ul>

<li>See your ad, mailing, Facebook page, newsletter or website for the first time.</li>

<li>Walk into your place of business.</li>

<li>Call you.</li>

<li>Place an order over the phone or Web.</li>

<li>Send you an email inquiry.</li>

<li>Sign up for your mailing list.</li>

<li>Return to make another purchase.</li>
</ul>

<p>While it may seem like extra work, these extra touches do matter. 
<a href="http://www.churchofcustomer.com/2011/10/14-new-statistics-about-word-of-mouth-marketing.html">According to the Word of Mouth Marketing Association</a>, 55 percent of consumers recommend a company to others because of its great customer service.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>Go through the above processes yourself. Ask yourself: Is this as good as it could be? Would this impress me? What can be improved? Your customers should feel that youve gone the extra mile for them.</em></p>

<h2>It's Easier Than You Think</h2>

<p>These tips may seem to take a lot of effort. And at the outset of establishing and building your brand, you might have to do a little homework. Once you get going, though, it gets easier, more routine and more instinctive  as long as you know your market, trust your intuition, maintain consistency and be yourself.</p>

<title>Importance of Labor Cost Reduction for Small Businesses Explained</title>
<description>Find out why it is so essential to control workforce expenses.</description>

<p>Discover how the profitability of your small business depends on effective labor cost control. Find out why it is so essential to control workforce expenses.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Reducing Labor Costs</strong></p>

<p>The price of labor constitutes a significant part of the total cost of a small business, and no business can survive for long by ignoring labor costs. Downsizing the workforce may result in short-term cost reduction. However, this will leave you vulnerable when you need to ramp up volumes with short notice. Unfavorable employee turnover also contributes to overall labor costs. Rational and intelligent labor cost control will boost productivity and enhance profits.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Direct and Indirect Benefits of Labor Cost Rationalization</strong></p>

<p>By keeping a keen eye on the cost of labor, you can save money in the short and long terms. Although this is the most obvious benefit, you will learn to recognize many other benefits once you begin the process of cost reduction.</p>

<p>Cost control is impossible without data related to labor costs and labor performance. With this data in hand, you both reduce costs and also find ways to improve efficiency, enhance skills, rationalize HR policies and boost employee morale. Collecting data to facilitate an informed labor cost reduction decision is a cost-saving idea in itself.</p>

<p>Invite cost-saving ideas from employees and make them a part of the decision-making process. Be innovative, perhaps by reducing the time allotted for breaks and using the money saved to set up a gym or a recreational zone for your employees. In this way, labor 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Time-Clocks-Time-Recorders/cat_DP3901">cost reduction</a> can actually help improve employer-employee relations.</p>

<p>
<strong> </strong></p>

<p>
<strong>Technology: a Fantastic Tool to Rationalize Costs</strong></p>

<p>Cost control can be initiated by automating the process of recording employee attendance. Software applications work to analyze data and determine the hourly efficiency of your workforce. This helps you assess employee discipline and efficiency and helps you plug wastages and leakages.</p>

<p>Is obsolete technology affecting the efficiency of your workforce? Spending money on improved solutions can help you automatically reduce labor costs without having to downsize a single employee.</p>

<p>Technological improvements have helped us overcome past limitations. Consider reducing expenses by asking employees to work from home. Offer flexible working hours and keep track of hours with the help of software applications and web cameras to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Webcams/cat_CL140467">reduce expenses</a>.</p>

<p>Use social networking websites to minimize the cost of finding new talent. Encourage employees to find new talent through professional networking websites. Consider the option of outsourcing the work to third-party freelancers to maximize cost reduction.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Risks Involved in Labor Cost Reduction</strong></p>

<p>Buying an automated time clock can cost between $350 and $500, which may seem exorbitantly expensive when compared to traditional solutions. Buying laptops and paying for the installation of networking equipment for work-from-home employees also may involve a hefty outlay. However, it is easy to spend and hope that benefits will automatically flow.</p>

<p>Technology, however, will yield benefits only if the collected data is utilized properly. You will also have to consider the recurring cost of maintenance and upkeep.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Labor cost reduction must become a part of the core vision of your small business. Factors affecting labor costs are always changing. Your efforts to reduce expenses must evolve accordingly. On the other hand, a keen business sense is also required, since one cannot just blindly hope that technology alone will reduce expenses.</p>

<title>Be the Boss: Managing Your Business, Your Employees and Your Time</title>

<em>Management is a challenge for many small business owners. Brush up on some of the essential skills with this handy guide.</em></p>

<p>You've done it. You're the owner of a small business  in command of your own destiny, calling the shots, forging new strategies, managing personnel and making key business decisions on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Yup, now you've done it.</p>

<p>Everything changes when you're in charge. Instead of following orders, you must generate them. Being in charge also means wearing many hats, such as operator, accountant, visionary and heavy. This constellation of far-flung skills has generated plenty of literature and a name all its own: management.</p>

<p>In this article, we walk you through some of the essential elements of effective small business leadership. We start by discussing how to manage employees and human resources; move into an exploration of leadership as an actionable concept; and finish up with a conversation about productivity and how to get the best out of your company.</p>

<p>Think of this as your thumbnail guide to the best thinking in management philosophy  and a great way to prepare for some of the coming challenges you might face.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Employees and HR: Your Living Asset</h2>

<p>Your employees are the lifeblood of your business, so managing them successfully is key. More than sales or analytics, this is the biggest challenge for many small business owners.</p>

<p>Effective management requires knowing how to resolve the many strong emotions that may arise in the workplace. More than anything, it means finding ways to let your people shine without surrendering goals or accountability.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>
Hiring the Best</em></strong></p>

<p>Step one is successful hiring. You want to seek and sign people who embody your philosophy and mission.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the recent trend toward "unconventional" interview tactics, from sticky brain puzzles to contrived hijinks.</p>

<p>Although many old-school HR types frown upon such practices, some data suggest creative thinkers tend to thrive in today's workplace, while the uninspired may falter.</p>

<div>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>There's no one-size-fits-all approach to recruitment. Your interviewing processes should simply reflect your priorities as you see them. If problem solving is the most desired skill, don't be afraid to put your prospects on the spot. If people skills are paramount, consider a deeper discussion around emotional intelligence and negotiation.</em></p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Managing Workflow </em></strong></p>

<p>Now let's say you've got the folks you want. Once your employees are at their desks, it's time to manage workflow. The days of top-down dictatorial management have given way to a more collaborative approach in many cutting-edge companies. Collaboration software, like 
<a title="Yammer" href="http://www.yammer.com">Yammer</a> and 
<a title="Basecamp" href="http://www.basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, has helped popularize a more inclusive way of working, and today's successful employers tend to seek out highly dynamic tools to let employees share their problems and solutions in real time.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>As a manager, you can aid this process by adding clarity and structure. Offer regular feedback and small milestones to keep everyone invested and on track. Communicate deliverables and assignments clearly, with a special emphasis on defining who is the point person on a given project. And build in discrete endpoints and deadlines to keep your company moving forward, as ill-defined projects can keep bouncing around the workforce forever.</em></p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Issues and Respect</em></strong></p>

<p>So what do you do when problems arise? Most experts agree that the old carrot-and-stick model of deploying praise and punishment is outdated. The smarter way to deal with issues is through clear communication: Define the problem, seek answers about its causes and be clear about likely consequences for repeat mistakes in the future. As for feedback, keep it frequent, tactful and couched in the language of collaboration and respect.</p>

<div>A final way to build an atmosphere of mutual respect is to solicit employee ideas. Nobody knows better than your workforce how their jobs might be improved. This is your chance to be humble and to learn. One popular question to ask  "What's the least useful thing you're working on right now? demonstrates to your employees that their opinions count, and that their time is valuable. When you have the right people working together and feeling heard, you begin to see the benefits of a widespread sense of shared ownership.</div>

<div></div>

<div>

<h2>Leadership Made Simple</h2>

<p>Leadership in the world of small business is a unique proposition: Small business owners (SBOs) get to lead in a far more intimate way than a blue-chip CEO ever could. Simply put, SBO leadership thrives on a human scale.
<strong> </strong></p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Look Ahead</em></strong></p>

<p>One of your most important jobs as a leader is projection  understanding where the marketplace is going and how to meet the challenges that arise. Leaders who focus only on company performance in the short term can miss the bigger picture, especially the very real possibility that everything is about to change.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>Force yourself to imagine disruptive events in your niche. Plan for that metaphorical earthquake. Engage your clients, vendors and employees in an ongoing conversation about how you'll adapt when the world shifts once again.</em></p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Lend a Hand</em></strong></p>

<p>Leadership also means mentoring. Its no accident that you stand at the helm of a group effort. Share your knowledge and expertise with coworkers and employees, and devise ways to draw promising individuals up through the ranks as they acquire more advanced skills. Good leaders love to pick worthy successors, of course, but such stars don't simply arise out of the ether.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>Continually aim to cultivate the best and brightest to discover top performers among your personnel.</em></p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Lead with Vision</em></strong></p>

<p>So now that we've covered looking outward and looking inward, let's look upward. Imagination is the third element of superior leadership: asking questions and pursuing opportunities with no immediate benefit.</p>

<p>Even if you're not trying to invent the next Facebook, it's worth blocking off some time now and then to wonder if your company might have undiscovered strengths or markets to explore. Google moved from search to email to hardware in about a decade. Can your business pull off a similar trick (perhaps on a smaller scale)?</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>These skills  projection, mentoring and vision  can keep your people motivated and your company on the cutting edge for a long time. Make sure to write them into your company's DNA.</em></p>

<h2>The Productivity Fix</h2>

<p>We've already reviewed employee management and leadership philosophy. Now it's time to drill down to the area where they intersect: productivity. This is the engine that will drive revenue and set the pace for your product cycle.</p>

<p>SBOs often struggle with how to get the most out of their employees and assets. The following tips can help you establish some best practices early on.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Eliminate Distractions, Except When You Don't</em></strong></p>

<p>Corporate America has swung wildly back and forth over the years between closed-down offices and wide-open approaches. Each extreme has its advantages, of course: A locked-down structure eliminates outside distractions, while an open system facilitates better cross-pollination of ideas.</p>

<p>Our suggestion: Give your employees some leeway at work, as more freedom often breeds better mental health. Many experts now believe in the empirical value of rest and recreation, especially because they can boost focus and morale.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>Consider instituting paid independent projects, flex hours, even telecommuting. You may be surprised how well some people perform with fewer limitations.</em></p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Invest in Technology</em></strong></p>

<p>It's no surprise that technology can increase your company's productivity. After all, that's largely what technology is for. But 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/assessing-your-small-business-technology-infrastructure.html">investing in the right tools</a> is absolutely essential if you want to avoid bottlenecks.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>Consider upgrading to a speedier network and putting all your employees on a single wireless carrier plan. Look into cloud computing to increase processing power and collaboration. And institute robust backup solutions to preserve all your data in the event of a natural disaster.</em></p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Systems Work</em></strong></p>

<p>Many companies waste too much time and effort on repetitive tasks, such as manual billing or routing phone calls. So look for opportunities to "systematize" common tasks. This might mean consolidating similar responsibilities and activities, or assigning one employee to streamline the process.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip:</em></strong>
<em> Don't have the in-house personnel to make this happen? Look into outsourcing the most mindless work or investing in software that can do it for you.</em></p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>The Inventive Incentive</em></strong></p>

<p>Finally we come to incentives, that time-tested and wildly popular way to boost productivity across the board. Wall Street firms may throw millions at their employees who excel, but SBOs are often a bit tighter on cash.</p>

<p>Some of the most effective SBOs have devised unorthodox incentives instead. These can include enhanced mentoring, offering an increased role in large meetings, even giving employees the chance to take control of a "passion project" on company time. Ask your employees what they believe in, and find ways to provide genuine, subjective value in exchange for great work.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Tip: </em></strong>
<em>Productivity thrives when your employees have enough time, the right tools and the right rewards. Eliminate pain points early on to let them reach their fullest potential.</em></p>

<h2>The Smallest Manager Handbook</h2>

<p>In the end, the best management advice is also the simplest: Know your industry, know your people, know yourself. Be a sponge for new information and opportunities, and treat the people you work with like professionals who are worthy of your trust.</p>

<p>Remember that a shared sense of mission can go a long way toward making any small business a success. Keep your eyes on the market and your focus on core principles.</p>

<p>Find out why it is important for business owners to remove odors from their buildings and what products are available to help.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p> 
<strong>Fighting Odors</strong></p>

<p>Odors can become a problem for your business, especially if you have a lot of foot traffic or allow food and drinks in your establishment. It may not only come from customers, as employees can spill the coffee that they brought in for breakfast or the orange juice they drank for lunch. Even water can cause an odor problem if it causes mold growth after being spilled.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Odor Removal Products</strong></p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Febreze-Fabric-Refresher-Odor-Eliminator-Fresh-Clean-Clear-32-oz-Trigger/product_PAG03259CT">Odor removal</a> products can help business owners keep their businesses odor free. Carpet deodorizers are often easy to use, as most simply needed to be sprinkled on the carpet before being vacuumed up. If you are concerned about the health effects of deodorizers, you can also find 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Natural-Magic-Odor-Absorbing-Gel-Vanilla-Bean/product_949486">natural air fresheners</a> that will help your buildings smell fresh without harming your health or the health of your employees. Simply place these around the office and other areas that can harbor odors.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits and Costs</strong></p>

<p>Having easy-to-use odor removal products around for your employees to use will help boost morale and productivity by eliminating irritating odors that may be driving employees outside for a breath of fresh air. The best thing about these odor removal methods, besides being easy, is that they are affordable. Most units will cost less than $10, and your total cost will depend on how many units you need. Business owners with larger buildings or a greater number of buildings will need more units.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Things to Consider</strong></p>

<p>These odor removal methods do come with a few downsides-the biggest being that these simple odor removal methods don't eliminate your risk for mold growth. Mold growth can not only cause odor, which can be covered up, but negative health effects as well. If you are successfully covering up the odor of mold growth, then you may not know it is there. The longer it grows unchecked, the longer you and your employees will be exposed to it and the more expensive it will be to eliminate.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p> 
<strong>A Workable Solution</strong></p>

<p>The best way to remove the risk of mold growth is to train employees to immediately and successfully cleaning up all liquid spills or, better yet, have a janitor on call that's trained to do so. Employees who are put off by cleaning up messes at work will be more likely to call in a janitor than they will be to clean the mess up themselves. If your employees simply leave a spill because no one saw them do it, and therefore no one knows who should clean it up, then it is likely to sit long enough to soak in and cause mold growth.</p>

<p>With mold prevention method standards in place and easy, efficient odor removal products on hand for your employees to use, you can successfully keep odors out of your business that would otherwise drive customers and employees away.</p>

<title>Office Cleaning Basics: Ignore Floor and Carpet Care at Your Own Risk</title>

<p>Ignoring floor care can lead to expensive claims for small business owners. Proper office cleaning improves employee health, productivity, and morale.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Floor Care and Reconditioning</strong></p>

<p>Proper floor care, regular cleaning, and systematic floor reconditioning can minimize safety risks, improve office cleanliness, and help in developing the right attitude toward general safety in employees. The right mix of manual efforts and hi-tech solutions will make the floor look good and improve the safety record of your office.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Good Office Cleaning and Care Helps Avoid Safety Issues and Expensive Claims</strong></p>

<p>Proper floor care and reconditioning is essential to minimize safety risks in your office, such as slip-and-fall accidents. Scenes of people slipping and falling seem humorous in movies and television shows. In real life, however, they can result in injuries and even death, and a small business may end up having to pay damages to the injured person, which can range between $26,000 to $30,000 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

<p>Clear and precise office cleaning rules, quality cleaning equipment, trained employees, general awareness toward safety, use of safety tapes and signs during 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Safety-Tapes-Crowd-Control/cat_CL167011">office cleaning</a>, and proper carpet care will improve office cleanliness and reduce the risk of accidents.</p>

<p>Poor office cleaning also affects the hygiene standards in the office, which may result in health problems, irregular attendance, and low morale in employees, as well as a decrease in productivity. Therefore, giving the appropriate attention to such a seemingly minor issue as office cleaning can help boost your reputation as a company that cares about its employees.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>New Cleaning Technologies Help Reduce Costs and Improve Efficiency</strong></p>

<p>Although this may look like an extravagant gesture, investing in modern, hi-tech cleaning equipment can help you reduce time and costs related to office maintenance and will pay off in the long run. Modern 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Vacuum-Cleaners/cat_CL140733">cleaning equipment</a> such as vacuum cleaners can drastically improve the quality of floor care, and purchasing the right equipment is essential when it comes to carpet care. High-quality gloves, dusters, dustpans, wipers, brooms, mops, and buckets will help instill a sense of responsibility in the cleaning staff.</p>

<p>Employees should be made aware of the safety risks involved in improper floor care. For this purpose, a display board devoted to office safety issues may help raise and maintain the overall awareness on the matter, and employees should be encouraged to contribute to this board with stickers and slogans related to office cleaning.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Developing the Right Attitude toward Safety is Essential</strong></p>

<p>The idea of reducing cleaning costs to boost profits looks attractive but may prove counterproductive long term. All it takes is a single accident involving an employee, and your plans to reduce costs and boost profits are ruined. Hence, it is important not to classify office-cleaning expenses as unproductive costs.</p>

<p>You must be prepared to invest a significant sum in modern and high-quality cleaning equipment. A multi-surface vacuum cleaner can cost around $300, with additional expenses for replenishing consumables and regular maintenance.</p>

<p>Simply buying fancy equipment, signs, boards, and other products will not automatically improve the quality of carpet care. It is crucial to develop the right attitude toward safety and office cleaning to extract maximum benefit out of these purchases.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Proper floor care and reconditioning will enhance productivity by improving employee health and morale. It will also prevent accidents and help your business avoid expensive and embarrassing workplace accident claims.</p>

<p>Green cleaning can give your business a great public image while lowering your operating costs.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Green Maintenance</strong></p>

<p>Going green is not always something that takes a lot of effort. However, you must give it some thought before jumping in headfirst. To get your business started on the right foot, you should first check out how to do green cleaning using green products and cleaning supplies.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Easy on the Mind</strong></p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Stearns-Green-Cleaning-Starter-Kit-Pre-Measured-5-Type-of-Cleaners/product_STNST0849UST">Green cleaning</a> is something every small business owner should consider.</p>

<ul>

<li>Going green is something you can tell your customers about. In today's society, many people are doing whatever they can to help save the environment. Some do this by looking for green products and services.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Using 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Green-Works-Natural-Cleaning-Wipes-62-Wipes-Tub/product_787360">green products</a> in everyday cleaning activities takes no extra time at all. All you or your workers have to do is use the products as usual. However, if you choose to, your staff can also use supplies available in every home. For example, vinegar and baking soda is a great alternative to bleach as it can clean most surfaces when mixed with a little warm water.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Advanced Cleaning</strong></p>

<p>Doing green cleaning is something your business can be proud of. It is not only a great start in labeling your company as green, but is also a step towards a healthier work environment.</p>

<ul>

<li>Regular cleaning supplies can contain petroleum-based substances and other toxic chemicals that may have environmental effects and cause health problems.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Green 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Rubbermaid-HYGEN-Microfiber-All-Purpose-Cleaning-Wiping-Cloths-Green-16-inch-12/product_659362">cleaning supplies</a> are natural and safe to use. They keep your business clean and fresh without the risk of health issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Is It Worth It?</strong></p>

<p>Going green with green cleaning is more affordable than you think. Many green cleaning supplies are items you may already have without knowing it.</p>

<ul>

<li>Green cleaning services generally cost five to ten dollars more per hour. However, using your current cleaning service and changing over to green products is an alternative.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>The overall cost of green cleaning depends on which products you wish to use. Luckily, many hazardous cleaning supplies can be replaced easily. Nonetheless, having your cleaning staff mix these products will likely take up more of their time. This may create slightly longer working hours.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Using green products can make the life of your cleaning staff easier; however it will initially cost more. Though many green products are now available for roughly the same price as their regular counterparts, some are more expensive. Nonetheless, green products are easier on furniture, fixtures, and other decorations you may have in your office. Over time, green cleaning is likely to lead to lower operating costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, turning your business over to green cleaning is not something you should do without planning ahead. However, if you do decide to do so, there are many green products and cleaning supplies available to help make the transition easier and hassle free. Furthermore, giving your business a green public image may be worth any extra cost.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Understand the differences between types of light bulbs and improve your business with this guide to bulb purchasing.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Bulb Purchasing Guide</strong></p>

<p>The invention of the light bulb heralded the age of electricity. Today, there are many types of light bulbs, and they differ greatly in terms of their light intensity, power consumption and color. Choosing the correct light bulbs for your business can be confusing, and this guide aims to assist you in making the correct decisions.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>What to Look For In a Light Bulb</strong></p>

<p>When purchasing a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Light-Bulbs/cat_DP1476">light bulb</a>, you need to look for the following characteristics: wattage or power consumption, energy efficiency rating or EER, bulb life, and light color. The packaging of a light bulb usually displays this information.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li>Wattage or power consumption refers to the amount of electrical energy a light bulb uses. The measurement unit is a watt. The higher the wattage of a bulb, the more expensive it is to use.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>EER refers to the ratio of the intensity of light produced per power used. This measurement is in lumens per watt. A higher number means the bulb is more efficient.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Bulb life refers to the average life span of a light bulb, measured in hours. This represents the average duration a light bulb can last when turned on.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Light bulbs are made of different materials and produce light in a variety of ways. Because of this, they also emit an assortment of colors. These colors range from a gentle bluish tone to a warm yellow color. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) can be almost any color.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Which Light Bulb?</strong></p>

<p>Choose a light bulb according to your needs. Some bulbs work better than others do in certain circumstances. A halogen light is usually too bright for a small room, while a small fluorescent bulb is insufficient to light a very large area.</p>

<p>For indoor use, fluorescent light bulbs are the best, and they have a high EER. Fluorescent bulbs have a very long bulb life, ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 hours. They produce either a cool or a warm white light, and the modern ones do not flicker or hum.</p>

<p>LEDs are efficient, inexpensive and available in numerous colors. They have many applications such as colorful lighting schemes in bars, restaurants and store windows.</p>

<p>An 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Incandescent-Light-Bulbs/cat_CL162732">incandescent light bulb</a> has a lower energy rating but is often used indoors because of the warm light it emits. This type of bulb can last from seven hundred to one thousand hours. It is also cheaper than a fluorescent light bulb.</p>

<p>Halogen light bulbs are used for high-intensity applications, most commonly in headlights of cars and spotlights. They are more energy efficient than fluorescent bulbs, but are more expensive. These bulbs may produce white or warm light depending on the materials used in the bulb.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Always remember that light bulbs come in a variety of types and colors, and some are more energy-efficient and cost-effective than others. Make the choice that is best for your business.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<title>Why Maintaining Your Heating System Is Important</title>
<description>A well-maintained heating system for your business is important for customer retention.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>A well-maintained heating system for your business is important for customer retention and cost-efficiency.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Winter Maintenance</strong></p>

<p>Winter is quickly approaching, and this means extra responsibilities for a storeowner. For many establishments, this means added inventory, such as shovels, snow blowers, and salt for ice and snow removal from sidewalks. A storeowner also needs to prepare the store itself for the upcoming cold and snowy weather.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Why Store Temperature Is Important</strong></p>

<p>There are few things worse for a customer than being physically uncomfortable in a store. Keeping your store too hot or too cold could result in customers not wanting to browse, and if the temperature is too extreme, customers might not visit your store at all. To keep your customers comfortable, you should have your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Heaters/cat_CL80001">heating system</a> checked on an annual basis by a qualified heating and cooling specialist. This will keep your heating system in good working order and ensure your customers enjoy their visit to your business during the winter months.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Choosing a Heating System</strong></p>

<p>Today's heating systems are very different from the old systems that many buildings still have. Modern systems are smaller, quieter, and more energy efficient. There are also more options for the heating source. Systems can run on gas, electricity, and steam, as well as more eco-friendly fuel sources such as wood pellets, water, and even solar. The type of heat source you choose will depend on the geographical location of your business, the size of the building, and your price limitations for the new system. You will want to keep in mind that although a more energy-efficient system might be expensive to purchase and install, you will make up the costs involved through lower heating costs. This is especially important for areas that have long, harsh winters.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Costs and Considerations of Heating Systems</strong></p>

<p>Pricing for your heating system will depend upon what work needs doing on your current heating system. For example, routine maintenance might only cost the price of a service call plus parts. You may find that the company has a set price for weatherization services. If your heating system needs work over and above the traditional service call, the cost will be greater and you will have to pay for replacement parts and labor. If you need to replace your heating system, the cost will depend on the price of the new heating system and the difficulty of the installation. An experienced heating specialist will be able to give you a firm estimate of costs for whatever services you might need. To make sure you are getting the best service for the cost, you should get estimates from several heating companies and, if possible, ask other business owners whom they use for their heating repair needs. You should also ask for commercial references along with the estimates you receive.</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>A well-maintained heating system is a good idea for any business. Not only will your customers be more comfortable but you also lessen the risk of winter hazards such as 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Safety-Supplies/cat_DP4675">frozen pipes</a> and frost on doors and windows. Put the money you save on heating your store into other areas of the business, such as new inventory or increased advertising. A wise investment now will pay dividends later.</p>

<title>Slip-and-Fall Prevention in the Business Environment</title>

<p>Keep your workers safe and keep your profits high with these simple yet effective slip-and-fall prevention techniques.</p>

<p>
<strong>Slip-and-Fall Prevention</strong></p>

<p>One of the most common accidents that can happen in a work area is the slip and fall. This event can be the cause of injuries that reduce a worker's effectiveness. Safety is the first rule of any business and, as a business owner; you should keep your work area as safe as possible. Several techniques regarding fall prevention will assist you in maintaining a safe working environment.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>What Causes Falls?</strong></p>

<p>A 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Safety-Tapes-Crowd-Control/cat_CL167011">fall accident</a> is often caused by slips and trips. These usually occur in places where there are many people moving around. A good example is a kitchen in a restaurant or fast-food eatery. In these places, people are often rushing and have little or no time to bother about where their feet are going. They hurry to get their jobs done as fast as possible to satisfy the needs and expectations of the customers.</p>

<p>Slipping occurs when there is a loss of traction between the underside of a person's shoe and the floor. The likelihood of this happening depends on the floor material and the type of shoe. Traction depends on friction; this differs according to the materials concerned. The presence of fluids, like water and oil, on the floor surface can reduce friction, increasing the chances of a slip.</p>

<p>Tripping happens when a person's foot collides with an object. The object does not have to be immovable to cause a trip, but the collision should be able to cause the person to lose balance. Any obstacle on the floor can cause a loss of balance by disturbing the rhythmic motion of the foot when walking.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>How to Prevent Falls</strong></p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Chairmats-Floormats-Rugs/cat_CG93">Fall prevention</a> is a factor you should always consider in your business. It is essential to keep your workers safe and effective. There are various ways to do this, including housekeeping, laying nonslip flooring, and providing protective footwear.</p>

<p>Housekeeping is a basic fall-prevention program. This includes the immediate cleaning up of spills and the use of special signs to indicate that an area is wet. All work areas should be cleared of obstacles and moveable objects kept in a particular place.</p>

<p>Special flooring is another effective way to prevent a slip-and-fall accident. Nonslip flooring maintains good friction between the floor and the underside of shoes, even if the floor is wet. An area that is often damp, such as a wash area, is a good place to lay nonslip flooring.</p>

<p>Protective footwear is often used in places where it is impossible to cover the entire work area with nonslip flooring. For example, farm workers wear boots that give them good traction despite the moist environment. This fall-prevention scheme is easily applied in any workplace.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Make Your Business a Safe Place</strong></p>

<p>Fall accidents should always be a concern to business owners; a single accident can have a negative impact on your team. Fall-prevention programs are the way to eliminate these unpleasant events and to maintain the trust of your workers.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Slip-and-Fall Prevention in the Business Environment</strong></p>

<p>Keep your workers safe and keep your profits high with these simple yet effective slip-and-fall prevention techniques.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Use technologies to improve air quality for smaller businesses and increase productivity.</p>

<p>
<strong>Indoor Air Quality</strong></p>

<p>Poor air quality not only creates an uncomfortable atmosphere, but also an unhealthy one. Any time you notice an overall problem with productivity at the office, take some time to find out what is causing the trouble. It is not always a personnel issue; one of the most frequently overlooked causes of poor performance is indoor air quality.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Poor Indoor Air Quality Signs</strong></p>

<p>Many times there are no physical signs that something is wrong with the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/HEPA+filter/directory_HEPA+filter?">air quality</a> in your workplace. There does not have to be an off odor, or a lot of visible dust for something to be wrong. Pay attention to your employees and clients; look for a change in attitude, appearance or actions. A few hints that the air they are breathing in is not clean include:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li>Scratching or rubbing eyes or nose - microscopic irritants, such as air pollution, often go unnoticed but will cause eyes and noses to itch or tingle.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Coughing and/or sneezing - once pollutants are inhaled, your body tries to get rid of them by sneezing or coughing them out.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>General malaise - having one or two people looking a bit sluggish after lunch is normal, especially if you know they have had a long night. However, if everyone in the office suddenly appears tired or lazy, it is usually something in the building.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Complaints of frequent headaches - not getting enough good oxygen to the brain will result in a headache.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Ways to Fix the Problem</strong></p>

<p>One of the first things you should do is change all the air filters in the heating, cooling and ventilation ducts. It would be a good idea to have 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/air+purifier/directory_air+purifier?">portable air filters</a> placed in small or heavily used rooms. It is also beneficial to have your HVAC system serviced to make sure that there is nothing in the ducting that could be spreading disease. These fixes are quick and easy, and will have your productivity increasing almost immediately. Your employees will feel better and happier too.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Purifying Your Air has Never Been Easier</strong></p>

<p>Advanced technologies in air purification have made it easy to keep dust, pollution and disease-causing pathogens out of the air you breathe. Portable units that sit in a corner are whisper-quiet and able to clean the whole room in just an hour. You can have a few units that you move from room to room when they are needed. There is no need to have units in rooms that are not used all the time.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Having Clean Air is Not Expensive</strong></p>

<p>It does not cost a lot of money to make sure that you and your employees are breathing clean, healthy air. Routine maintenance on the entire HVAC system will cost roughly $100 and should be performed twice a year. Air filters for the ducting cost about $3.00 each and a portable air purifier can be purchased from about $80.00 to $300.00. Having everyone working to their potential will create much more income than the amount you spend annually on air filtration and purification.</p>

<p>Do not underestimate the importance of air quality in the work place. Ensuring you keep the air clean will mean a better bottom line for you and a better place to work for your employees.</p>

<p>LEED certification is a government program that can help your business protect the environment and increase its profits.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>LEED Certification Recognizes Green Buildings </strong></p>

<p>LEED stands for leadership in energy and environmental design. It is a program created by the U.S. Green Building Council that certifies the design, construction, and operation of green buildings. A LEED certification refers to recognition that the practices involved in the construction or operation of a building are environmentally friendly. Buildings that have received this certification are commonly known as green buildings or eco-friendly buildings.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Why Is It Important?</strong></p>

<p>
<strong> </strong>Our environment is fragile, and we need to take care of it. Pollution has already damaged many of our natural resources, and it will continue to do so unless we try to reduce it. LEED certification helps business owners reduce pollution and protect the environment for future generations.</p>

<p>Certified 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/easy-on-the-planet/recycling-and-eco-services.html">eco-friendly</a> buildings also have other benefits. LEED-certified buildings are more economical and efficient than conventional buildings. They use less electrical energy and water. They also provide a healthier environment, greater comfort, and improved safety. This increases the productivity and efficiency of your employees.</p>

<p>Eco-friendly buildings, which are leased or sold, often attract tenants or buyers faster, resulting in greater profit. These buildings are known to reach occupational stability faster and receive tax benefits and incentives.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>How Does LEED Certification Work?</strong></p>

<p>To be able to get a LEED certification, your project or building must earn points per criteria in the program. There are six categories, and a project or building must satisfy LEED requirements to earn points. These categories are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in design.</p>

<p>A LEED certification for commercial eco-friendly buildings has four levels. Each level corresponds to the number of points a project or building has earned. These points are the sum of the points from each category. The minimum required number of points for certification is forty. The next level is a silver certification, which requires fifty points, while gold certification requires sixty points. The highest is the platinum certificate, and the minimum number of points required to receive this is eighty.</p>

<p>For 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/ecoeasy/sustainable_earth.html">green homes</a>, a different rating system is used. A green home is a residential type of eco-friendly building. There are different point categories and levels. Each level also has accompanying credits or rewards.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Tips for Getting LEED Certification</strong></p>

<p>If you are aiming for LEED certification, many things need to be planned before you even begin designing an eco-friendly building or a green home. This plan includes what level of certification you want. This gives room and flexibility as the project proceeds.</p>

<p>The first item you need to consider is your budget. The basic LEED certification for a green building does not necessarily require more expense, but higher certification levels do. Once the budget is set, you need to stick with it throughout the project. Failure to do so may cause you to get a lower certification level.</p>

<p>You then should value-engineer your project. This means you need to determine if the eco-friendly investments you will make will increase expenses over time. Energy-saving and eco-friendly equipment that costs less typically does not last as long. You should match the type of equipment that will be used with the expected life cycle of your building.</p>

<p>Hiring LEED accredited professionals can also help you get this certification. These include architects, engineers, consultants, environmentalists, and product marketers that have many experiences with green and eco-friendly buildings. They can help in achieving a LEED goal with little or no extra cost.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Taking care of the environment is everyone's responsibility. The LEED certification program will help you fulfill this responsibility by encouraging business practices that do not damage the environment. It may be more expensive, but it does have many benefits that can increase profit.</p>

<title>Top Tips You Need to Know for Effective Advertising</title>
<description>Effective advertising is crucial to the success of any endeavor, whether it is a business, a charitable group, a political campaign or a fundraiser.

<p>Effective advertising is crucial to the success of any endeavor, whether it is a business, a charitable group, a political campaign or a fundraiser. Proper use of signage as well as choosing that signages design is crucial to the success of your product. Fortunately, it is easy to find signage, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Envelopes-Labels-Mailing/cat_SC1679">mailing supplies</a> and other 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Custom-Marketing-Materials/cat_CL167719">custom marketing materials</a> at Staples.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Signage allows you to alert local consumers to your project, which makes it potentially more effective than broader radio or television campaigns that are costly and reach a smaller percentage of your target audience. For businesses that rely on walk-in customers, such as retail shops in areas with lots of foot traffic, signs may be the most effective way to advertise. Businesses that are located off the beaten path may need signs to draw customers who otherwise would have no reason to pass their door. Signs are cost effective and frequently long-lasting, unlike other forms of advertising that have to be restocked or updated. Signs made of aluminum or wood can be used for years, while poster board or plastic yard signs may be more desirable for short-term events like political campaigns and fundraisers.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>Honing in Your Message</h2>

<p>Remember to adjust your sign design to your location and target clients. If your business is located in a shopping center, you may wish to choose colors that contrast with the buildings design. For themed events such as fundraisers or political campaigns, you may wish to use red, white and blue or a color strongly associated with your project. Dont use too much text in your sign  if it is too crowded, people may not read it at all. Use a concise, focused message to attract more attention. Be sure your sign is a good representative of your business  it should be attractive and high quality. If not, potential customers may make negative assumptions about your endeavor. Companies like Staples can help you select signage designs that will attract attention tastefully.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>Things to Watch Out for</h2>

<p>The main drawback of signs is that unlike digital forms of advertising, they must be discarded and replaced when information changes. If your advertising ideas evolve, you should expect to purchase new materials. For this reason, it is better to use more expensive signs for aspects of your business that are unlikely to change over time  addresses and phone numbers are well-suited to signage, but sales and promotional events may not warrant a high-quality sign. Because signs are portable, some thought should be given to securing them. If you expect bad weather, you will need to secure your signage. Large A-frame signs can frequently be secured with a chain, preventing theft or loss.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Though signage is usually not the only marketing method needed for a project, it can be a cost-effective and wide-reaching tool. By selecting the right signage for your project and using good design principles, you can maximize your advertising dollars. This is especially true if your business relies on foot traffic to draw customers. If you have a highly localized target audience, signage can be a more effective communication tool than pricier digital methods.</p>

<title>A Flu Prevention Guide for the Workplace</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Flu season is upon us and that means runny noses, chills and body aches. For a small business and its employees, that can mean days spent home in bed or feeling sick in your office, which results in lost working hours. Did you know that flu costs businesses approximately $10.4 billion each year in direct costs for hospitalizations and outpatient visits for adults?</p>

<p>The best prevention method is getting your flu vaccination. Everyone six months of age and older should get an annual flu vaccine, even if they were vaccinated last season.  In addition, there are some other tips you can follow to ensure you and your co-workers aren't knocked out by the flu. Staples, a trusted source for not only office supplies but office solutions, offer these easy flu prevention tips to keep your workplace as flu-free as possible.</p>

<ul>

<li> 
<strong>For employees:</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Most importantly, wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds or use an effective alcohol free or alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available. Clean hands, either through washing them or using hand sanitizer, can lead to a 20 percent reduction in absenteeism in a workplace situation.</p>

<p>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) and other flu prevention sites say you should avoid touching your nose, mouth and eyes, so any germs you may have come in contact with in the office cant make their way into your body. If you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, or cough and sneeze into your upper sleeve. If your office has them, dispose of tissues in no-touch trash receptacles.</p>

<p>Routinely clean frequently-touched objects and surfaces at your own work station like keyboards and phones to help remove soils containing germs. Why is it so important to clean these areas? The average desktop has 400 times more bacteria than the average toilet seat.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/clorox/directory_clorox?">Clorox</a>, the cleaning products provider, calls these areas germ hot spots and recommends you try not to use other workers phones, desks, offices or other work tools and equipment. If necessary, consider cleaning and disinfecting them. It may make for an awkward moment when you wipe down a co-workers phone before using it, but thats better than getting sick.</p>

<p>If you do begin to feel sick while at work, go home as soon as possible so you can minimize your co-workers exposure to the flu (or whatever else you may have). In a poll conducted by Staples last year, 85 percent of employees said theyd come into work even when sick, but 34 percent said theyd prefer it if their co-workers stayed home when they were sick. If you wake in the morning and feel sick, alert your boss. More and more companies these days have flexible work arrangements, so if you can work from home, do so. Call your doctor to see if you need to schedule an appointment. Your doctor may be able to prescribe medicines (anti-viral drugs) to make the flu illness milder and shorten the time you are sick, which will get you back to work quicker.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong> </strong>
<strong>For small business owners:</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you own or run your own small business, you probably already know how the flu can affect production. On average, workplace absenteeism due to personal illness costs U.S. businesses $230 per employee. If youre a small business of even 30 people, that means almost $7,000 lost annually.</p>

<p>In addition to encouraging the flu vaccination for all your employees, its also important to encourage effective communication throughout your company, according to Staples Advantage, the business-to-business division of Staples. Make sure you provide information on the importance of flu vaccination, proper cleaning and disinfection, flu facts and office wellness tips to employees and staff. If you have the available resources, spread the message about flu prevention with posters in the break room or handing out flyers in employees mailboxes.</p>

<p>Also, make sure youre prepared. According to a survey cited by GOJO, makers of skin health and hygiene solutions, 25 percent of standard bulk soap dispensers have harmful levels of bacteria, so stock the office with appropriate hand sanitizers in areas identified as germ hot spots and consider hands-free soap dispensers in the bathrooms and kitchens. Not only are these low-cost items, but theyre actually better at stopping the spread of germs. Step up your cleaning program to more frequently clean commonly touched surfaces like the door handles and elevator buttons. The 
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/business/Toolkit_Seasonal_Flu_For_Businesses_and_Employers.pdf">CDC</a> says you should keep a full supply of tissues, soap, paper towels, alcohol-based hand rubs and disposable wipes.</p>

<p>And finally, consider some flexibility in scheduling to let staff get their vaccination, stay home when their sick, or work from home. Even though people should stay home for at least 24 hours when sick with the flu, the latest technologies, like tablets, laptops and other home office solutions are making it easier for employees to be productive remotely.</p>

<p>A broad assortment of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Cleaning-Supplies/cat_DP1870?ddkey=http:StaplesZipCodeAdd">cleaning solutions</a>  like cleaners, disinfectants, sanitizers, hand sanitizers and pre-moistened wipes  are available at

<![CDATA[
<p>Companies today are making strides at prioritizing health in the workplace  everything from thwarting sniffles and sneezes, to reducing aches and pains, to emphasizing and fostering healthy living habits. By placing an emphasis on workplace wellness, they can reduce absenteeism, boost productivity, increase employee retention and gain a competitive edge. With employee medical costs often eating up more than half of corporate profits, its clear that a healthy workforce can contribute to a healthy bottom line.</p>

<p>As a result, wellness initiatives are increasingly viewed as a win-win for employers and employees alike. Today, 81 percent of American businesses have some form of health promotion program in place. To be truly effective, its important that health-oriented programs and initiatives are not just isolated efforts but are firmly entrenched in the corporate culture. In addition, because health concerns can pervade nearly all aspects of the workplace, its important to take a multi-faceted approach to workplace wellness.</p>

<p>The following five areas and checklists highlight ways your company can promote employee wellness, along with suggestions for integrating healthy living initiatives across your office or company at large.</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Office Design with Wellness in Mind</strong></p>

<p>During the workweek, the office becomes, in many cases, a home away from home. Many employees spend at least half their waking hours there  logging in more time sitting in their chairs than sleeping in bed each night. From office chairs to keyboards to even ceiling lights, companies have countless opportunities to link the design of employee workspaces and the overall office to wellness principles.</p>

<p>For an office design that promotes wellness, keep the following items on your checklist:</p>

<p>Evaluate ergonomics. Work might be, quite literally, a pain in the neck without furniture that supports employees and allows them to comfortably perform their daily tasks. In fact, 86 percent of U.S. workers report experiencing some discomfort from their office furniture and equipment. The good news is that its often easy and cost-effective to foster a more comfortable office environment by providing ergonomic options  such as chairs with multiple points of adjustability, adjustable height desks, ergonomic keyboards and monitor stands  companies can increase comfort and wellness in the workplace, and decrease potential worker compensation claims. In addition, providing education on ergonomic best practices  so your employees know how to properly use and adjust their equipment  is a free way to increase comfort and productivity.</p>

<p>Examine indoor air quality. You may not be able to see indoor air pollutants, but that doesnt mean they should be ignored. In fact, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), levels of indoor air pollutants may be two to five times  and occasionally more than 100 times  higher than outdoor levels. To avoid triggering or aggravating allergies, or other adverse reactions, your company can address the following areas to improve indoor air quality:</p>

<p> Furniture. When outfitting a room, beware of furniture selections  including fabrics and finishes  that contribute to off-gassing, a process that occurs when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde are released into the air. Third-party certifications, such as GREENGUARD and Scientific Certification Systems (SCS) Indoor Advantage
<sup>TM</sup>, indicate furniture that preserves high indoor air quality.</p>

<p> Paints. Choose low- or zero-VOC paint options, and ensure that areas are well-ventilated after painting.</p>

<p> Plants. Plants can add a literal touch of green to the office  improving indoor air quality and office aesthetics.</p>

<p>A bright idea: Look at lighting. You can improve visibility and worker morale, as well as reduce eye strain, by paying attention to interior lighting. In addition to elevating moods, access to natural light and daylight views can also help companies attain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) credits. Light dimmers and automatic shut-off controls contribute to LEED credits as well, and help employees adjust lighting to their comfort level and preferences  also contributing to a healthier work environment.</p>

<p>
<strong>2. Clean Up Your Act</strong></p>

<p>Use floor mats. In addition to presenting an unkempt image, dirty and slippery floors can also pose a health and safety hazard to building occupants, while causing damage to flooring and carpeting within your building. Providing 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Floormats/cat_DP4479">floor mats</a> in entry ways is an important first step in combating these problems. In fact, with a high-performance matting system, roughly 90 percent of the dirt and soil brought into any building can be contained within the first 10 to 15 feet.</p>

<p>Seek sustainable cleaning solutions. Traditional cleaning chemicals can emit unwanted vapors and contaminants that can degrade air quality and negatively impact health. To better protect building assets and occupants, its important to select sustainable and safer cleaning solutions with low to zero VOCs, and low to no odor. Need to be pointed in the right direction? Credible, third-party certifiers and verifiers of cleaning solutions include Green Seal, UL Environment (formerly EcoLogo) and the EPAs Design for the Environment (EPA DfE).</p>

<p>Concentrate your cleaning. In addition to contributing to cost savings and reduced waste, highly concentrated cleaning solutions also introduce lower levels of chemicals into the building, and minimize unwanted and unpleasant chemical odors and vapors in the air.</p>

<p>Stop mold before it starts. To eliminate the unsightliness and health risks associated with mold, its important to use cleaning to establish a proactive and preventative approach. Routinely clean air vent covers, filters and floor drains, and avoid over-wetting surfaces to prevent mold and mildew growth. Remove any mildew deposits that do occur immediately and thoroughly.</p>

<p>
<strong>3. An Apple a Day</strong></p>

<p>A healthy diet is an important first step toward a strong immune system and bulwark against flagging energy levels and zapped productivity. As such, encouraging healthy eating habits is another way to promote wellness in the workplace. Today, more than one-third of U.S. adults are classified as obese, a leading cause of diabetes and other medical issues and expenses. Its no secret that poor nutrition can contribute to this weight gain and fatigue  a problem often compounded by a sedentary lifestyle.</p>

<p>In an overall effort to promote and increase wellness, companies can help steer employees toward responsible food choices. Heres some food for thought to add to your checklist:</p>

<p>Restock the breakroom. Help employees stay alert and healthy with 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Healthy-Snacks/cat_CL163191">smart snack options</a> that curb the munchies. Offer alternatives to candy bars, sugary drinks and pastries in the office breakroom. For example, snacks and refreshments including trail mix, granola bars and bottled water are popular, healthy items that are easy to stock. By making these items freely available to employees, you can curtail out-of-office snack runs and the ensuing lost productivity as well.</p>

<p>Arrange for fresh fruit deliveries. Instead of bringing in donuts for those monthly meetings, opt for more natural sugars, and consider treating employees to fresh fruit instead. Partnering with a company that provides fruit delivery services can ensure you have healthy and tasty snacks available. Look at whats on the menu for lunch too. Lunch meetings can be healthier and reinvigorating when you order in salads, instead of pizza or sandwiches.</p>

<p>Scrutinize the vending machines. If possible, help employees avoid temptation lurking in the vending machines by stocking the machines with healthy options  low in saturated fat and sodium.</p>

<p>Combine healthy food with other healthy habits. For example, enabling employees to incorporate short bursts of exercise into the workday can promote wellness and increase focus. So encourage employees to take breaks when possible  whether its walking around the office during lunch or even doing stretches at their desks. You can use posters to highlight beneficial at-desk stretches.</p>

<p>
<strong>4. Fight the Flu</strong></p>

<p>The flu and other colds, especially when working in close quarters, can have a domino effect in the workplace  taking down workers and seriously hindering productivity. There are real, hard costs associated with the flu too  studies show it costs U.S. employers $76.7 million a year in employee absenteeism and other indirect expenses . But as temperatures drop, it doesnt have to be inevitable that sniffles and sneezes follow to invade the office.</p>

<p>Put the following items on your checklist to inhibit germs and keep staff healthy:</p>

<p>Wipe-down common-touch surfaces. Think of how many people have touched those door handles, stair railings, elevator buttons, copiers, and conference room phones, water coolers, vending machines and ATMs. Sanitizing these common-touch surfaces frequently  even more so during flu season  is critical to keeping germs at bay. Even if a surface appears to be clean, it could still be harboring germs, so its important to establish regular cleaning routines, and educate employees on hand-washing. Items that individual employees touch frequently can harbor germs too. Studies show that one-third of employees believe their keyboards and phones are the dirtiest items in the office  but less than 10 percent say they clean them often . By providing 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Pre-moistened-Wipes/cat_CL141838">sanitizing wipes</a> and encouraging employees to wipe down their workstations, you can foster a cleaner, healthier office environment.</p>

<p>
<strong> </strong>Provide employee education. Consider formal education campaigns, including newsletters and informative posters, that encourage employees to cover your cough and sneeze in your sleeve (not hands!) when a tissue is unavailable. Again, highlight the importance offhand-washing.</p>

<p>
<strong>5. Take Advantage of Technology</strong></p>

<p>Sixty-five percent of employees say they go into the office when sick  preventing them from performing at full potential, exposing their colleagues to a host of germs and even threatening the office with a bout of infections. For those times when pressing projects make it difficult to take a sick day, technology can enable employees to still work without leaving a trail of infection in their wake. Its easy and often economical for companies to provide the technology tools and know-how that contribute to a healthy work-at-home environment.</p>

<p>Dont wait  vaccinate.</p>

<p>Educate employees on the importance of getting annual flu vaccinations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), flu season usually begins in October and can last until May. Because it takes about two weeks after getting the flu shot for your body to develop protective antibodies  and for the shot to become effective  its a good idea to get vaccinated early, so youre covered during the onset and onslaught of flu season. You can also consider helping employees get convenient access to flu shots by having company-hosted, on-site vaccination events so employees dont get the flu and dont spread it. Work without leaving a trail of infection in their wake. Its easy and often economical for companies to provide the technology tools and know-how that contribute to a healthy work-at-home environment.</p>

<p>
<strong>Keep these items on your checklist</strong></p>

<p>Make it easy to work from home</p>

<p>Dont advocate toughing it out at the office, and instead encourage employees to work from home if theyre coming down with a cold. Providing the proper technology tools and infrastructure will help maximize employee productivity and out-of-office success. Top items include laptops and/or tablets for connectivity outside the office, and easy access to the companys virtual private network (VPN). Make sure employees are well-versed in security protocol as well  especially if theyre accessing sensitive data and transferring important files in and out of the office.</p>

<p>Consider a formal telecommuting program</p>

<p>In addition to helping thwart germs, Telecommuting programs can have other health benefits. Where appropriate, companies can leverage technology  ranging from email to videoconferencing and unified communications (UC)  to implement telecommuting programs that reduce real estate costs, contribute to green goals and help promote employee health.</p>

<p>Through furniture and technology, companies have the opportunity to help their telecommuters be even healthier  as 60 percent of teleworkers report discomfort or injury from their home office furniture and/or equipment. As a result, companies can foster wellness and productivity  and drive success for their telecommuting programs  with ergonomic technology and furniture offerings. Flexible, multi-purpose furniture solutions and organizers can also maximize space and versatility.</p>

<p>By banishing gridlock from their workday, telecommuters report being in better moods and recuperating the time for greater productivity.  A recent survey shows that telecommuters stress levels dropped 25 percent on average since they started working from home, and 80 percent said they maintained a better work-life balance due to telecommuting. Their increased job satisfaction strongly correlates to increased results  as 86 percent also reported increased productivity.</p>

<p>
<strong>Its a Team Effort</strong></p>

<p>Promoting wellness in the workplace should be a cohesive and collaborative effort. The initiatives, procedures and activities above span diverse parts of an organization, so it makes sense for multiple parties and stakeholders to get involved. A formal wellness program can yield great ROI  with medical costs dropping about $3.27 for every dollar spent and absenteeism costs decreasing by up to $2.73 for every dollar spent.
<sup>12</sup></p>

<p>Organizations can also promote the formation of a wellness team  tasked with identifying and implementing health-oriented programs, and gathering and synthesizing feedback. Its often helpful if the team itself is representative of the company  including a diverse group of employees with different health profiles and priorities. In addition to spearheading wellness programs, the team might also encourage the formation of walking clubs, help incent employees to use the corporate gym (if available) and provide newsletters with healthy living tips.</p>

<p>In addition to cultivating wellness with a dedicated team and through areas including furniture, technology and cleaning supply fulfillment, HR can also play a strategic and educational role  for example, driving awareness of any health insurance benefits employees can take advantage of. These often include gym membership reimbursements, weight loss program discounts, smoking cessation programs, health risk assessments and more.</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Its often easy and cost-effective to take steps to foster a healthier work environment. With areas including office design, cleaning routines, healthy snacks, flu prevention techniques and technology all having an impact, organizations can take a comprehensive look at what they need to address, develop and/or refine a checklist of their own, and raise awareness through employee education. Taking action to provide and promote a healthy workplace can help organizations demonstrate their commitment to employee well-being  all while decreasing absenteeism, increasing productivity, inspiring healthy living and defraying costs. Now thats a healthy return!</p>

<title>What Small Business Owners Need to Know About Cutting-Edge Networking Options</title>
<description>Network connection speed is always increasing, learn how technology can keep you on track.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Network connection speed is always increasing, and small business owners should think about how they can stay abreast of improvements and use new technology to their advantage. Since a growing number of commercial exchanges are gravitating from in-person transactions to online transactions, faster network connections translate into more revenue, better customer service, and increased efficiency. To unlock these benefits, however, business owners need to be equipped with the right technology and knowledge. Staples, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/technology-research-centers/networking/index.html">a trusted source for office solutions</a> and an expert in small business technology, has the following tips for small business owners that need help navigating these changes as they look to set up or update their network.</p>

<ul>

<li>Consider the number of people that will connect to the network and how it might change with time. Since a small business can employ dozens or hundreds of workers (and chances are its workforce will expand), the best networking option will be flexible to account for change.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>A wired local area network, when possible, is often the best option for operations that demand high bandwidth Internet connections. Setting up a wireless network inside a small office with an open layout may be the easiest option, however, as it doesnt require running wires to each workstation. Keep in mind that if a small business operates inside an office building with multiple levels and obstructions, the wireless signal may be disrupted. If this is the case, a wired connection or several business-grade wireless routers may be necessary. Consider the size and structure of the building. A small, standard-grade router will sufficiently supply Internet access inside a small building, but a stronger router, such as the newest 802.11ac router, is necessary to cover an expansive commercial space.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Determine whether employees, customers, or a combination of both will connect to the network. It may be that you want to set up two networks: one for customers and one for employees.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Decide whether employees will need to connect to the network while away from the office.  Telecommuting allows business owners to expand their teams to include talented and qualified workers who cannot work on-site. Other small businesses may rely solely on remote workers to eliminate the cost of renting an office space. The most efficient and popular solution for setting up a remote office space is to establish a VPN, or a virtual private network. A VPN allows employees to access files, applications, and even office hardware remotely through secure software.</li>
</ul>

<p>The exact type of VPN device a small business needs depends on the size of the company, the allotted technology budget, and personal preference. Regardless of what type of VPN a small business decides to implement, however, the most important factor is that a business-grade cable or DSL router that features a consistent IP address supports the network. Higher-tier routers are designed with businesses in mind, and they come packed with features to comply with the demands of a VPN.</p>

<ul>

<li>Taking the idea of remote business operations a step further, the practice of cloud computing is a networking option that is becoming popular at an ever-increasing rate. The idea behind cloud computing is to make all facets of a businesss daily operations available online. As a result, employees and owners alike can access the files, databases, or programs they need through the designated online cloud space, which is typically set up through a company website that features various layers of permissions and security. Unless a business is originally established using a cloud infrastructure, switching to this option can be a large undertaking. However, cloud computing can drastically reduce or eliminate the amount of money spent on office space, manpower, equipment costs, and more.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Keep your data safe. With networking technology advancement comes an upgrade in on-board security features, which is an essential for business owners that want to keep their files and data safe. According to the 2012 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report 2012, 98 percent of small business security breaches occur at the hands of outside agents. Utilizing encryption software, taking advantage of penetration tests, and setting up a secure firewall are all viable steps a small business owner should take to keep important files, including finance information, safe from intruders.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Dont fall behind. New and improved networking devices exist for a reason; as the average amount of bandwidth consumed per person rises, the technology that delivers that bandwidth must also grow. New technology like cloud computing servers and the 802.11ac router meet these demands by improving on previous models and networking techniques. Along with increased performance also come new features. The 802.11ac router, 
<a href="http://www.netgear.com/about/press-releases/2012/05152012.aspx">like the latest from Netgear</a>, includes the ability to connect plug-and-play devices, such as printers or external hard drives, directly into the router, instantly making them available to any computer or device on the network. The ability to connect to a printer from a phone or tablet adds a new level of convenience that can simplify the daily operations of a small business.</li>
</ul>

<p>Switching to or setting up new technology can be both exciting and intimidating for any small business owner, but the promise of prosperous, more productive work processes serves as a good industry motivator. Take advantage of the latest technology as it rolls out, and begin experiencing how upgrading your networking system can revolutionize the way you do business.</p>

<title>7 Ways to End a Meeting the Right Way</title>
<description>Effective meetings allow a company to quickly move through issues and identify problems before they arise.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Effective meetings allow a company to quickly move through important issues and identify problems before they arise. Meetings should not be allowed to linger, however, and open-ended meetings often end in uncomfortable moments. The art of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Planners-Calendar-Planners/cat_CL166388">time management</a> and conducting effective meetings includes understanding when and how to end the event.</p>

<p>
<strong>Winding Down Your Meeting</strong></p>

<p>Conducting a meeting allows a business owner to sit down with personnel and learn things that might not be apparent during day-to-day operations. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Personal-Organizers-Refills-Calendar-Planners/cat_CL166401">Effective, well-planned meetings</a> often rely on specific start and ending times, but may fall outside of these times if important issues arise. Unnecessarily long meetings are a drain on the company's human or financial resources, and short meetings may fail to encompass all important points.</p>

<p>The first priority for effective meetings should be to end the meeting when all key information and decisions have been reached. The second key ending point is when as much of a consensus as possible has been reached. A deadlocked meeting often ends with setting a follow-up time for a future meeting, and creating this time on the spot allows the event to remain productive. Changing a single meeting into a series of meetings provides another way of ending an effective meeting. This is important when more information must be garnered over time before issues may be settled. A fifth option is to end the meeting on a high note, with praise for individual departments and forward-looking statements. This is especially effective if a meeting has unexpectedly taken a negative turn.</p>

<p>Cost is another factor if you are considering when to end events so that they remain effective meetings. Elevated emotions during negotiations or key strategy meetings can cause problems down the line or unwise financial decisions, and it's often best to wait until later so that cooler heads may prevail. The final method for ending a meeting is to watch the clock. Ending a meeting precisely on time may be required if key personnel must return to their posts or the cost of the meeting or meeting area does not allow continuation. This should be a last-ditch option, however, as it can diminish the effectiveness of the event.</p>

<p>
<strong>Creating the Perfect Ending</strong></p>

<p>These seven ending methods should be in any entrepreneur's arsenal for ending effective meetings. Each has its specific time or place and may not work in all situations, but knowing the difference between a meeting that is winding down and one that is just catching on is as much art as science. Consider pulling the plug and calling it a day when:</p>

<ul>

<li>All parties are in agreement and key decisions or plans are made</li>

<li>A major consensus has been reached</li>

<li>The meeting would be more effective as a series of events over time</li>

<li>Deadlock threatens to stall the meeting indefinitely</li>

<li>You must address negative situations and can still end on a high note</li>

<li>Tempers flare preventing a consensus or agreement from being reached</li>

<li>All else fails and time runs out</li>
</ul>

<p>The key to effective meetings is tackling each issue involved in the meeting's purpose and then moving on. These seven techniques allow you to end a meeting without diminishing the overall purpose of the event.</p>

<title>How to Print and Design Your Own Labels Like a Pro</title>
<description>Doing business often requires mailing items to clients or customers. Whether you're invoicing a client, mailing a brochure or shipping a product, you'll want to make sure that it gets to the right destination and receives attention as soon as it arrives.</description>

<p>Doing business often requires mailing items to clients or customers. Whether you're invoicing a client, mailing a brochure or shipping a product, you'll want to make sure that it gets to the right destination and receives attention as soon as it arrives. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/return-address-labels.html">Custom printed labels</a> can have precisely those effects. While you could purchase generic labels, it's better to use this mailing as an opportunity to distinguish your company. By designing and printing your own labels, you will make an impact on whoever sees them, gathering attention for your mailed item while leaving a memorable impression.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong> Make your mailings stand out</strong></p>

<p>A 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Inkjet-Address-Labels-Address-Labels/cat_CL140954">label</a> can do more than get your mailed material to the correct destination; it can also serve as an advertisement for your company.</p>

<p>With label templates, you can easily design custom printed labels using specialized 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Label-Factory-Deluxe-30/product_639970">label design software</a>. Combine this with matching label-printing paper such as that made by leading label manufacturer Avery, and you have custom printed labels that can be quickly printed in batches for use whenever needed.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Design and Print </strong></p>

<p>Making custom printed labels today is easy compared to older methods of designing your own. Thanks to the standardization of label sizes, labels can be easily matched with templates to increase design speed and reduce sizing misprints.</p>

<p>There's no need to customize your software to match the label size any more. The specialized software matches available templates to sizes for you, or allows you to create custom printer labels without a template with the label size as a base. All that's required to print your own labels is to install the design software to your computer and follow the software tutorial to design your label. Choose your template by the size of the label you need to print. You can import pictures to use on your labels, or type whatever text you wish in the font desired. Be careful not to overdesign your label, causing clutter that can lead to misreading the destination address. After designing and saving your label, just load the label paper into the printer, and then print as many labels as you need.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cost of Custom Labels</strong></p>

<p>Custom printed labels can be printed at prices that most businesses find easily affordable. The labels themselves typically cost between $20 and $40 for packs of 1,500.</p>

<p>There are several types of the labels made to fit a variety of printers, from pin-fed printers to laser or inkjet models. The software used to design labels varies in cost as well. Some basic packages can cost about $20, while other more advanced packages can cost up to $60 or more. You will also need to add in the cost of ink used to print the labels, which can vary according to the design that you make and whether you use any colors for the label. Templates can become an additional cost if you choose to purchase pre-designed templates to modify for your labels. There are thousands of free templates available online, though, including several offered by Avery.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>The Value of Customization </strong></p>

<p>Creating custom printed labels gives you an additional marketing tool to use with your business communications. With specialized software, labels can be designed quickly and easily. The labels aren't much more expensive than plain address labels either, with total costs dependent on design elements.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<span style="font-size: small;">
<span style="color: #000000;">One of the biggest mistakes business people make is assuming that working from home will automatically result in a higher level of productivity. Unless you carefully construct your 
<a href="http://store.closetmaid.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TopCategoriesDisplay?langId=-1&amp;amp;storeId=10151&amp;amp;catalogId=10051">home office environment</a>, you may find that working from home is less productive than you anticipated.</span></span></p>

<h2> </h2>

<h2>The Ideal Working Environment</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-size: small;">
<span style="color: #000000;">Home office setup is an exercise in knowing yourself. Before you make any decisions, make a list of the things you need to spur productivity. Some people can work at a desk in a common area of the house with the television running in the background. Others want a closed-door environment where distractions are minimized. For some people, a home office is a place to finish up work from a regular day job. For others, a home office is a primary workspace where they spend eight or more hours of the day. Before you start rearranging the furniture, decide what you need as an absolute minimum to encourage you to use the space as intended. A home office, like that old treadmill in the basement, does you little good if you never use it.</span></span></p>

<h2>The Right Office Furniture, Equipment and Supplies</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-size: small;">
<span style="color: #000000;">Once you have decided whether you're going to segregate an area of the living room, convert a spare bedroom or set yourself up in the basement or garage, you should start thinking about </span>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Small-Office-Home-Office-Furniture-Collections/cat_CL158904">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">home office furniture</span></a>.
<span style="color: #000000;"> The type of office furniture you pick and the way you organize your space will significantly impact your productivity. </span></span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-size: small;">
<span style="color: #000000;">If you come from a work environment where you were forced to work with whatever furniture and equipment your employer provided, you may find that once you have a choice, the way that your home environment is set up will distract you if it is not naturally comfortable. For example, some people like desks with drawers on the left and right sides, while others prefer a desk that resembles a conference room table. Some people prefer to have their desks face a wall, while others want their desk to face the middle of the room.</span></span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-size: small;">
<span style="color: #000000;">Whatever your preferences are, investing money up front in the style of office furniture that makes you comfortable will naturally lead to greater productivity. At the very least, this ensures that you won't be tempted to relocate to the bedroom instead of working at your desk. Likewise, an upfront investment in office supplies and equipment will help you get your work done faster and avoid distractions. Before investing in supplies and equipment, you must first decide on the level of efficiency you want to achieve in your home office. Do you want the ability to do anything at home that you otherwise do at a remote office, or do you simply want to work on your computer and print out a document when needed?</span></span></p>

<h2>The Cost of Outfitting a Home Office</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-size: small;">
<span style="color: #000000;">A basic home office setup can cost you under $500 if you already have a computer that you can relocate to your new space. There are a number functional </span>office furniture options
<span style="color: #000000;"> that look expensive but are actually quite affordable, especially if you are willing to put the furniture together yourself. A printer and a phone with an answering machine can round out a basic home office setup. </span></span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-size: small;">
<span style="color: #000000;">A more advanced home office setup would include a fax machine and a photocopier. Fortunately, there are 3-in-1 office machines that combine a </span>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="http://www.staples.com/All-in-One-Printers/cat_CL161518 ">printer, fax and copier all in one</a></span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> piece of equipment for under $300, saving you money and space. Keep in mind, however, that a machine that does many things often offers fewer features for each specific function. For example, if your work at home requires more than the occasional photocopy, it can be more efficient to buy a dedicated copy machine that has special functionality to handle a heavier workload.</span></span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-size: small;">
<span style="color: #000000;">Don't forget to set aside money in your home office budget for office supplies. From paper to paper clips, you will have to buy all of the little things that you took for granted when you worked for an employer. Make a complete list of the items you use when you work, and go out and buy an extra supply. You will avoid the aggravation of not having staples for your stapler or the right size binder clip for a presentation if you do a major supply run before you start working in your home office.</span></span></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-size: small;"> </span>
<span style="font-size: small;">
<span style="color: #000000;">A home office is sometimes considered the holy grail for people who work. Who wouldn't want a comfortable home oasis where commuting is a foreign concept and the work just gets done? To achieve home office nirvana, you must make a plan that is specifically designed to meet your individual needs and choose the right home office furniture, equipment and supplies to make your plan a reality.</span></span>

<p>Companies need business supplies to operate effectively. Accountants need spreadsheets just as carpenters need tools. However, whether you are a plumber or a florist, some 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Office-Supplies/cat_SC1">office supplies</a> are universal; every business needs these supplies to function properly. Here is a list of supplies for business that every company should have to ensure that daily operations run as smoothly as possible.</p>

<p>
<strong>Business Supplies Every Business Needs</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>A Computer: Some will argue that a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Computers-Technology/cat_CG71">computer</a> is not necessary to run a business, but a computer definitely makes running a business easier. Your computer can be used to balance your business bank account, launch your marketing campaign, track your inventory and communicate with your customers. Using computer software to help run your business will make your business more efficient and save you time.</li>

<li>Computer Software: Using 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Computer-Software-Accounting-Forms-Security/cat_CG5">computer software</a> will make daily operations easier. There is a variety of software available to help you manage your business. For example, you can track customer payments, schedule appointments, maintain a website or blog, manage your social media platforms and do your taxes with software you can purchase for your computer.</li>

<li>A Printer: If you want to send letters to your customers or hard copies of invoices to your vendors, having a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Color-Laser-All-in-One-Printers-All-in-One-Printers/cat_CL161518">printer</a> means you can print everything you need yourself. You won't have to take all your information to a document center and have it compile and print everything for you. You will save time and money if you can produce these documents yourself.</li>

<li>File Folders: A messy desk can significantly lower your productivity if you can't find important paperwork with ease. Putting all your documents into labeled files will make finding the things you need easier.</li>

<li>File Cabinet: Once you have all your paperwork in files, you will need somewhere to store them. A filing cabinet decreases the number of piles you have on your desk and keeps your work organized.</li>

<li>Miscellaneous Supplies: At one point or another, you will need to write something down. Whether you're taking notes during a client call or making a to-do list, business supplies such as a pen and paper are necessary. You'll also need business supplies such as a calendar, sticky notes, paper clips, a day planner and a stapler for daily tasks.</li>

<li>A Telephone: Whether you opt to have a landline phone installed or choose to use a cell phone, your customers will need a way to contact you.</li>

<li>A Paper Shredder: You do not want to throw away papers with sensitive information such as customers' credit card numbers, contact information or your own personal information. A paper shredder enables you to discard old documents and reduces the chances of someone stealing your information.</li>

<li>Office Furniture: Whether you choose to completely furnish an office or just want a comfortable office chair and a functional desk, office furniture will help you work more effectively and give your workspace a professional feel.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Where to Purchase Supplies for Business</strong></p>

<p>You can purchase business supplies at many different locations, and often the pricing is different. It's important to shop around for the best prices before you purchase any business supplies. Even if you purchase supplies from more than one store, you can save money by comparison shopping. You can also find bargains by purchasing from online suppliers and buying in bulk.</p>

<p>Operating a business takes more than a good idea and hard work. Having the right equipment for business offices in order to function can make or break a company. Buy the business supplies you need, and your office will run smoothly.</p>

<p>Companies need business supplies to operate effectively. Accountants need spreadsheets just as carpenters need tools. However, whether you are a plumber or a florist, some office supplies are universal; every business needs these supplies to function properly. Here is a list of supplies for business that every company should have to ensure that daily operations run as smoothly as possible.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>When you are ready to take the leap into business ownership, one of the most important steps you can take is to make a written business plan, which is a road-map that will help guide your business through the ups and downs and the day-to-day normal business activity. The idea of writing a business plan is enough to make many people crawl under their desks, but there is no reason why writing a business needs to be torturous.</p>

<p>
<strong>Why You Need to Make a Business Plan</strong></p>

<p>Although you don't have to have a business plan to launch a business, it is a good idea to make a business plan for several reasons:</p>

<ul>

<li>If you plan to seek outside financing, a business plan is a requirement for most lenders and private investors.</li>

<li>Completing a business plan is a good way to have your business information at your fingertips, for your own reference or to answer questions asked by others.</li>

<li>You can use a business plan to assess your company's progress and determine where changes or adjustments may be necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Sections of a Business Plan</strong></p>

<p>A business plan is broken down into several sections. Each section explains a different aspect of the business or how the business will fit into its specific industry.</p>

<ul>

<li>Executive summary: Although this section appears first in the business plan, it should be written last. It gives an overview of the information contained in your plan.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Company description: In this section, you explain your corporate structure (sole-proprietor, partnership, LLC, etc.). You will also provide the location of the business and a brief description of what the business will do.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Product or service: This section thoroughly explains the products and services your business will offer, with an emphasis on how those products and services will benefit your customers.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Market analysis: This is where you show your understanding of the marketplace, who your competitors are, the share of the market you hope to achieve, and how your products or services will fill a need not currently being met by your competitors.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Strategy and implementation: This is a breakdown of how you plan to launch your business and your ideas on how to stand out in the marketplace. You will also explain how you plan to maintain your business growth.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Web plan summary: If your business will have a Web presence, use this section to explain the costs involved in building and maintaining your website, Internet marketing campaigns, and social media strategies.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Management teams: Introduce the key members of your management team and provide brief biographies highlighting their experience.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Financial analysis: This section includes the projected profit and loss and cash flow tables for at least two years. Five-year projections are preferred for investors.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Many companies rely on a selection of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/businesscards.html">business card templates</a> to craft their own business cards. These templates provide a basic starting point, allowing you to make your own business cards. However, if not carefully used, they may fail to capture the overall feel of your company.</p>

<p>
<strong>Making an Effective Business Card</strong></p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/businesscards.html">Creating business cards</a> does not need to be an expensive or time-consuming process. Business card templates allow you to quickly enter key information, such as names or contact numbers, but they often fail to convey the personality of your business. More effective cards can have a greater influence on your vendors and customers and lend additional credibility to your enterprise.</p>

<p>Modern business card technology allows for embossed cards, large numbers of colors or images and die-cut designs that can take any shape or form. Simple business cards are effective but may not impress your business partners. Business card templates often create a very simple design that can be easily scanned into a smartphone or business card organizer. Try selecting card colors or printing methods that match those used in your company. Business logos should match the text colors on the card and even complement the embossed design of the card itself. Images should never interfere with the lettering on the card, but careful use of colorful designs can make your card more effective in the field of business card template lookalikes. Colors should clearly stand out from backgrounds, and every word of the text should be easy to read at arm's length.</p>

<p>Advanced cards come with an additional cost. Many companies offset these costs by keeping two sets of cards. They may use one for everyday encounters and another for important trade shows, meetings or high-value clientele. Cards created from simple business card templates can be a great fallback when your high-end cards are unavailable. New cards for a company can range in cost from tens to thousands of dollars, but their impact as a marking tool allows a savvy entrepreneur to recoup those costs quickly. Consider adding a coupon code or similar marketing device to the underside of the card. This entices customers to visit your store or office and see what you have to offer.</p>

<p>
<strong>Creating the Perfect Card</strong></p>

<p>Crafting the perfect card for your business is a trial-and-error process. Like most marketing tools, the benefits may not always pay off immediately, but the long-term benefits include a larger clientele and enhanced visibility of your business. This sets your business apart from the companies that rely solely on unenhanced business card templates. You may wish to attempt a standard marketing rollout process when changing your cards. Try creating a set of different cards and distributing them at random to see which ones new customers bring back into the store. This technique works especially well when combined with coupon promotions or other methods of individually marking your cards.</p>

<title>Start a Home Business with an Idea and this Checklist</title>
<description> Starting a home business has its own special challenges.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Starting a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Small-Office-Home-Office-Furniture-Collections/cat_CL158904">home business</a> is the solution for people who want to work for themselves but want to do so from the comfort of home. Starting a home business has its own special challenges, but with some planning and research, you can run a successful 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/meet-todays-efficient-home-officesmall-business.html">business from home</a>.</p>

<p>
<strong>How to Come Up With an Idea</strong></p>

<p>Choosing a home business idea can be the hardest decision an aspiring home based business owner makes. Some choose to turn hobbies into businesses, others opt to buy into a franchise, and still others choose a business idea that is something they enjoy doing. The most important things to consider include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Can the business be successfully run from home? Some home businesses require more equipment or space than others, and you will need to consider how much space you have to dedicate to your business.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Is there a market for the home business ideas? Although doing something for which you have a passion is important, you will go out of business quickly if there isn't a need for your services or a market for your products.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Can you afford the start-up costs? Starting a business from a hobby can mean an inexpensive start-up, since you probably already have the tools and materials to get started. On the other end of the spectrum, some franchises are expensive to start. Research the start-up costs of any business venture that interests you so you don't have unwelcome surprises later.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Licensing and Zoning Issues</strong></p>

<p>Before you launch your business, you must ensure that your city or neighborhood allows for a home based business. Check with your local business authority, which could be the city or county clerk, whether your particular neighborhood has any zoning regulations for running a business from home. This is especially important if you will have clients coming to your home or if you will be receiving a large number of packages from delivery companies such as Fed Ex or UPS. You will also need a license to run your business. The type of license and its fee will depend on the type of business you plan to operate. Your city or county clerk can tell you which license you will need and how much it will cost you.</p>

<p>
<strong>Preparing for Start-up</strong></p>

<p>Once you have chosen a home business idea and acquired the necessary licenses, you can start preparing to launch your home business. One of the perks of owning a home based business is that you can start small and add 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Office-Supplies/cat_SC1">equipment and supplies</a> as you grow. But even the smallest of businesses need the basics, some of which include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Office supplies such as pens, paper, a computer, a printer and other general supplies</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Specific tools to complete your work. For example, if you want to start a handyman</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>service, you'll need several tools.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Creating or ordering marketing materials such as business cards and signs.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Large office equipment such as a desk, chair and filing cabinets.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Write your business plan. Although you don't need a plan to start a business, it is a good idea to have a plan so you can track the progress of your business. Also, if you intend to pursue outside financing, a business plan will be a requirement of lenders and private investors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Owning and running a home business can be a rewarding experience. If you do your homework and choose a business with a demand for your products and services, you can soon find yourself the owner of a successful business.</p>

<title>Buying the Right Paper: A Guide  </title>
<description>See why it's important to choose the paper that is right for your budget but still looks good for your product.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Selecting the right office supplies can be tricky. Paper speaks about the feeling, function and quality of your final product. Thus it's important to choose the paper that is right for your budget but still looks good for your product. Therefore, you need to take the time to find the answers to the following questions:</p>

<ul>

<li>What is your final product? This can be a poster, book, business card, flyer, and others.</li>
</ul>

<p>How long do you intend to use the product? A flyer intended to be used for one day needs a lower durability than a book to be read for several years.</p>

<ul>

<li>What feel do you want your product to achieve? Should it be cheap? Fancy? Traditional? Solid?</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>What type of material would the product handle? Will it be a textbook or a photo album?</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Choosing the Right Office Supplies</strong></p>

<p>There are some parameters that distinguish one paper from another. See that you take them into consideration when selecting the right 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Paper-Pads/cat_CG10">printer paper</a> for the job.</p>

<p>
<strong>Coated vs. Uncoated Paper</strong></p>

<p>The choice between coated and uncoated paper probably has the greatest effect on the total appeal of your final product, so you should choose prudently. Typically, most papers other than matte coated papers are ideal for printing photos and other types of art. This is because the quality of the paper allows the printer ink to stay on the surface of the paper instead of getting absorbed underneath the surface. The result is a glossy finish and brighter colors. On the other hand, uncoated paper has a natural and rough feel, making it the preferred choice for producing material that contains a lot of text.</p>

<p>Coated paper has found myriad uses in illustrations, photography, and other applications that need to stand out. On the contrary, uncoated paper is primarily used for everyday magazines and books.</p>

<p>
<strong> </strong>
<strong>Weight and Thickness</strong></p>

<p>Choosing the right paper weight is a bit tricky. This is because it can be gauged in a number of ways, depending on the place you're working in. Two most commonly used measurements are pound weight and grams per square meter of 500-sheet ream with 17" x 22" dimension.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Paper weight is occasionally indicated by the "#" symbol. For instance, "10#" means "10 pounds per basis ream of 500 sheets." One rule of thumb to follow in choosing the right paper weight is as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>20-24# 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Standard-Weight-Copy-Multipurpose-Paper/brandedcat_CL140691_Standard+Weight_20365">standard-weight paper</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>24-28# for average-quality posters</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>80-100# for most business cards</li>
</ul>

<p>With regard to thickness, the greater the weight of a sheet of paper, the stiffer or thicker it is. A caliper is often used to measure this, which is ordinarily given in thousandths of an inch.</p>

<p>
<strong>Brightness</strong></p>

<p>The paper's brightness indicates the percentage of wavelength of blue light that it reflects. It is usually expressed on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being the brightest. At any rate, the majority of papers reflect from 60 to 90 percent of light. This is an important consideration as the brightness can affect the appreciation of ink color, readability, and contrast between dark and light hues.</p>

<p>
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>When looking for the right business supplies, begin your search by identifying your final product. The next thing to take into account is the function and the quality you wish your paper to have. To make the right choice, you can't avoid making some compromise between price and quality.</p>

<title>The Dirt on Office Cleaning  </title>
<description>Keeping the office clean can be a full time job. Learn easy steps to help.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Routine office cleaning requires a wide array of 
<a title="office cleaning supplies" href="http://www.staples.com/Cleaning-Supplies-Cleaners-Chemicals-Soaps-Wipes/cat_DP1870">office cleaning supplies </a>that remove dirt and kill germs. These products may be either concentrated to remove the dirt and stain left over by your employees or mildly formulated to gently clean your delicate electronics.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Commercial Cleaning Products to Use</strong></p>

<p>It is sometimes hard to identify whether the office cleaning products you bought at the grocery store have disinfectants in amounts sufficient to kill viruses and bacteria. If unsure, read product labels carefully and look for active ingredients and statistics online about what kinds of germs each product kills to determine what will satisfy your needs best.</p>

<p>One alternative to selecting an office-cleaning product that both disinfects and cleans is to clean with a detergent or soap first, and then sanitize surfaces where viruses and bacteria most likely thrive. Some office cleaning products you need are the following:</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li> All-purpose cleaner. These cleaners, often in spray bottles, work well for spot cleaning messes on the kitchen countertop and floor or conference room tables, as well as desks and reception area.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li> Aerosol graffiti remover. This product ensures a professional look of your office bathrooms. It removes lipstick, ballpoint ink and crayon from metal surfaces and tile so you can have a tidy bathroom again.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li>Wax and gum remover. This can save your carpet. It is very helpful in areas where food is served, where kids can bring a lot of trouble and damage to your carpet or where candles dribble.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li>All-purpose cleaner. This can be used to sanitize rigid surfaces. The suggestion is to find products with neutral PH to remove dirt and grease without damaging floors, countertops, or the individual doing the cleaning.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li>Spray disinfectant. This can keep your break area clean. Apart from dissolving stains, a disinfectant clears away pathogens left behind by food, such as staphylococcus and salmonella. There are a multitude of options on the disinfectant market that can meet office needs relating to allergies and preference. If a bleach-based disinfectant is too harsh, no need to worry: products that don't use are easy to find.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li>Compressed air dusters. These are essential for maintaining your sensitive computer equipment safe. They use air blast to eliminate debris and dust from monitors, keyboards and hard drives without destroying any part.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li>Erasing pads. This can save and prolong the life of interior paint. Melamine foam pads can be saturated with cleaners for use in removing fingerprints, scuff marks, crayon and dirt from walls.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<ul>

<li>Whiteboard cleaners. These are used to erase the previous day's brainstorming leftovers. It is possible to purchase wipes that are pre-moistened to delete shadows and stains to be able to begin the next meeting with a clean board.</li>
</ul>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Keeping your office clean and organized is something that constantly requires you to allot adequate resources. This is a justifiable investment, though, since you spend a lot of time in your office every day and it is where you make business. To get the most out of your investment, see that you buy only the needed office cleaning products to get the job done.</p>

<title>How to Construct the Perfect Presentation Handout</title>
<description>Presentation handouts let you get important messages across in a visually appealing method. A number of presentation tips can help you create effective handouts whether you're trying to impart key information to your employees, explain complicated metrics to investors or deliver a marketing brochure to interested customers.</description>

<p>Presentation handouts let you get important messages across in a visually appealing method. A number of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/presentations.html">presentation tips</a> can help you create effective handouts whether you're trying to impart key information to your employees, explain complicated metrics to investors or deliver a marketing brochure to interested customers.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>Crafting Effective Handouts</h2>

<p>An 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/content/copyandprint/presentations.html">effective presentation</a> relies on a combination of verbal and visual cues designed to deliver information and minimize confusion. Small businesses must constantly create such presentations to keep their employees and investors on top of events as they occur. Many presentation tips can help you save time and money when crafting handouts. Saving money during the initial creation step and avoiding common pitfalls can help your company's bottom line.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>At one time, handouts required either an in-house or professional print team. While these may still be useful for big projects, many small businesses can rely on small print centers to help save money or print their projects themselves on modern printers. Presentation tips for cost-effective modern printing include using the right paper for the job and understanding the qualities of your printer or print service. Heavier papers with high brilliance ratings produce crisp, clear handouts that last for some time. Printers typically work best with one specific type of paper, and multipurpose papers may cause smudges or blurry images. Common fonts and simple text can effectively communicate the written portion of the handout. Handouts created by following these presentation tips deliver written information in a simple fashion and use images to illustrate more difficult concepts.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Other presentation tips involve recovering the costs of additional printing services and materials. Entrepreneurs should combine handouts for marketing purposes with other brand-building campaign events. The use of flyers or brochures at events sponsored by the company or trade shows can dramatically increase exposure and provide a more lasting impression on potential customers or business partners. You can also increase camaraderie among business peers by passing along your presentation tips and secrets. The increase in business from the use of these handouts should help offset the tens to hundreds of dollars involved in their creation.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>Getting the Most from Your Handout</h2>

<p> Remember to use quality paper that is suitable for your printer or printing service when you create handouts. You can save costs by creating images, charts, tables and other graphics in-house; make sure that only skilled artists or knowledgeable employees work on these elements, however. Unclear data or unprofessional graphics may cause your handouts to have the opposite of the desired effect, costing you money or customers instead of generating the same. Presentation tips can only take you so far when creating the perfect handout. Trial-and-error is a continual process and a major component of marketing and small business operation. Invest only what you can afford in presentation materials, and always budget for potential mishaps to keep your business and assets safe during this process.</p>

<title>Organizing Business Cards into a Rolodex Worthy of a Rockefeller</title>
<description>Many professional entrepreneurs rely on a business card organizer to keep information on their clients or vendors up to date.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Many professional entrepreneurs rely on a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Business-Card-Holders-Desktop-Organizers-Holders-and-Accessories/cat_CL140804">business card organizer</a> to keep information on their clients or vendors up to date. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/programs/copyandprint/business_cards.html">Business card</a> management allows a business owner or manager to keep important contact information close at hand at all times. Different methods of organization often require different tools for this purpose. The development of electronic systems allow business owners to choose either modernized rolodex filing of physical cards or scanning and creating digital contact databases. Some systems even combine the two for maximum flexibility.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>Setting up a Business Card System</h2>

<p>Clutter is often an entrepreneur's worst enemy. Lost business cards can result in lost connections and relationships, and may ultimately result in missed opportunities for your small business. A business card organizer allows you to know where your business card selection is at all times and organize business cards in a manner that is meaningful to you or your business. This cuts down on the time it takes to find contacts and allows you to spend more time working on building the relationships that such cards start.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Business card organizer options have come a long way from the index card and Rolodex systems of the past. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Scanners-PCs-Drives-Accessories/cat_CL158948">Digital scanners</a> and cameras allow small business owners to effectively file away and retrieve hundreds or thousands of contact forms without the need for physical storage. Electronic indexing of physical cards is still available for those who prefer a business card organizer setup that lets them keep the card itself. This allows small business owners to keep a back-up copy in case the original card is damaged or lost. Variants of these systems allow you to maintain a physical Rolodex that automatically sorts itself and turns to the correct entry when you access it through your desktop or mobile device.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Electronic business card organizer systems vary greatly in cost, based upon the features and portability of the system. Handheld business card organizer setups let you scan cards immediately upon receipt, but usually cost more than bulkier scanners that fit next to your computer on your desk's top. Upgrading to digital storage should still cost less than a hundred dollars, even for the more expensive setups. There may be time costs associated with learning to use a business card organizer or in scanning or storing a large number of existing cards. Make sure you look for a machine that allows for simple and regular backups. This ensures that you retain your data even if your device fails at an inopportune moment.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2>Making the Right Organization Choices</h2>

<p>Choosing the right business card organizer helps you reduce clutter and avoid the hassles of lost or damaged cards. Keeping contact information readily available through digitization and careful organization lets business owners deal with exponentially more clients and maintain relationships on a level not easily accessible without advances in organization technology.</p>

<title>Office Breakroom Essentials: the Undisputed Checklist</title>
<description>Satisfying breaks are imperative to keeping employees working hard when they're on the clock.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Satisfying breaks are imperative to keeping employees working hard when they're on the clock. You can help them during their relaxation by adding 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Coffee-Water-Snacks/cat_SC1684">breakroom supplies</a>  to your list of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Pens-Tape-Desk-Supplies/cat_SC1678">office essentials</a>. Small appliances, eating utensils and available entertainment will allow your employees some relaxation time before they get back to work.</p>

<p>
<strong>Make or Break Employee Morale</strong></p>

<p>Employees who feel overworked and underappreciated begin to resent their bosses and look for better jobs. The most successful small- and medium-sized businesses know how important an established and knowledgeable workforce is to company success and do what they can to prevent turnover from becoming a problem. Show your employees you care by ensuring they have enjoyable breaks during the day.</p>

<p>To do this, you need to provide an office breakroom that is separate from the work area, along with comfortable chairs and sturdy tables they can use for sitting down in groups together. Getting along with other people while you're on break makes time away from work more satisfying. Put up bulletin boards sporting motivational posters to encourage interaction and a positive mood, and have TV, radio or reading material available to help take employees' minds off work for a while.</p>

<p>Offer a few free snacks and coffee for employees, and give people an affordable way to bring food from home. Make sure your breakroom has small appliances, such as a mini fridge or microwave, available for storing and heating food and drinks. Individual cup coffee brewers are great for small offices with a handful of coffee drinkers, while larger machines can fill 12-cup pots or urns that will last the entire day. Along with these you'll need brewing essentials, like paper or reusable filters, creamer, sugar, and stirrers. Don't forget to stock enough paper or plastic goods like disposable cups, plastic cutlery, and plates, so employees feel comfortable eating in the office and you can forget about washing dishes at the end of the day. Adding a vending machine is a good alternative to stocking snacks on your own. Supplies that encourage healthy, enjoyable eating are essentials that often go overlooked.</p>

<p>Finally, encourage your employees to claim ownership of their breakroom. Providing garbage bags and cleaning supplies gives workers the opportunity to take pride in their space by keeping it clean. Adding personal hygiene products and a first aid kit helps them see the breakroom as a necessary place for taking care of their needs at work, as well as a convenient resource put together by owners who care.</p>

<p>
<strong>Using Today's Technology to Help Workers Feel at Home</strong></p>

<p>There are a variety of devices that can help provide a break from the workplace and don't cost an arm and a leg. In the past, canned music piped through elevators and common areas left employees annoyed. Today's options for audio include small, portable speakers that can be hooked up to iPods and other personal music sources. Other office essentials, like small appliances, have become smaller and more affordable as well.</p>

<p>
<strong>A Worthwhile Investment in Employee Appreciation</strong></p>

<p>Updating a breakroom is much more affordable than creating one from scratch, but the biggest expense involved will be creating an area just for employees to relax in. Entertainment, dining and cleaning essentials shouldn't add much to the company budget. Paper supplies, in particular, can be extremely affordable when purchased in bulk.</p>

<p>The biggest issues you'll run into when establishing a breakroom would be the cost of small appliances. Thankfully, the cost of dorm fridges and small heating devices like microwaves has gone down dramatically in the last 10 years. Paying a bit more for models with high reliability rates will ensure your investments will last.</p>

<strong>Creating the Perfect Breakroom</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A big challenge for small-business owners is proper computer equipment selection. From tablets to desktops, todays computer options can be overwhelming. Let us help you pick the perfect hardware for your small business.</p></blockquote>

<p>No two small businesses are alike. But while a letterpress artist and a preschool proprietor have vastly different needs and goals for the work they do, they both want the right tools for the job.</p>

<p>This article walks you through a few important factors to consider as you invest in the perfect hardware for your company.</p>

<h2>The Mobile Company</h2>

<p>Highly mobile companies need highly mobile hardware. This means three things: a good smartphone, a good tablet and a super-light notebook, such as an ultrabook.</p>

<p>Smartphones are more than just pocketable communication devices nowadays. Some of the most versatile phones double as full-featured netbooks, letting you edit documents on the fly, view media presentations and even video chat with distant colleagues.</p>

<p>Todays smartphones come with built-in peripheral functionality that lets you attach screens and keyboards for a lightweight laptop experience.</p>

<p>Tablets and ultraportable notebooks follow the same principles. Apple and Android continue to rule the tablet space, with the iPad boasting the biggest software selection and Android offering a dizzying array of form factors and screen sizes. With the release of Windows 8, however, Microsoft is poised to gain considerable market share.</p>

<p>For ultralight notebooks, look for long battery life and lightweight design first, then think about how you want to present yourself to potential clients. You may also want to invest in a portable wireless hotspot from a major cellphone carrier to ensure you always have a ready data stream, even when youre beyond the reach of Wi-Fi.</p>

<h2>The Home Office</h2>

<p>To thrive in the small confines of a home office, you need some great hardware.</p>

<p>Its tempting to use your existing consumer electronics to run the business, but many small-business owners quickly discover they need sturdier machines. Err on the side of fast, multi-core chips and plenty of RAM if you want a home workstation to last through multiple business cycles. For an even bigger productivity boost, look for video cards that can handle two or more monitors to build a true nerve center in your home office.</p>

<p>Consider the specific needs of your business as well. A blogger may only require a good video card to watch the latest viral sensation. A graphic designer, on the other hand, will need a brilliant screen and plenty of RAM to run resource-heavy software like Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>

<p>Avoid the temptation to buy more than you need. Unless youre running those extremely processor-intensive applications, most mid-level machines are plenty fast enough for spreadsheets and email.</p>

<h2>The Traditional SMB</h2>

<p>Does your company have 10 or more employees? Do you work in a bona fide office with networking and infrastructure? Small to medium businesses, or SMBs, require their own dedicated hardware.</p>

<p>Most small companies can get by with a consumer-level router and a basic network setup, provided 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/easytech-debunks-the-biggest-wireless-networking-myths.html">some strong encryption is deployed across the network</a>. Stick with mid-level computing stations unless your employees are editing large media files. For more advanced tasks, consider investing in several topflight laptops or a bundle package of high-end PCs.</p>

<p>For file swapping and sharing, consider a cloud storage solution from the likes of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/carbonite-online-backup/index.html">Carbonite</a>, 
<a href="http://www.box.com">Box</a> or 
<a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>. Just be sure youre backing up regularly and 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-five-most-common-security-lapses-made-by-small-businesses.html">avoiding the common pitfalls of small-business resource management</a>.</p>

<p>Investing in the right tools for the job is essential if you want your company to stay competitive. Be thoughtful about your specific mobility, processing power and security requirements to keep your business flexible and adaptable, no matter what may come.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mobile devices tend to see more Angry Birds playtime than business use. Learn how to transform your smartphone or tablet into a small-business dynamo.</p></blockquote>

<p>Smartphones and tablets have some limitations as business tools: small keypads and touch-screen keyboards prevent many people from using mobile devices as anything more than high-tech calendars. People are more likely to play Angry Birds on their smartphones than conduct business. And thats a shame, because with a few carefully chosen apps, you can turn your smartphone into a tiny business powerhouse. Weve come up with a few suggestions to make your mobile use more about productivity and less about recreation.</p>

<h2>Staying Organized</h2>

<p>Staying organized can be difficult when youre constantly switching between a PC, smartphone and tablet. You need to be able to quickly synchronize your contact list, schedule and to-do lists.</p>

<p>While your mobile device probably includes at least some synchronizing abilities, those features may not be sufficient for business use. You may want to consider a more powerful app, such as 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Any-Time-Organizer-Deluxe-Version-14-Boxed-CD/product_369334">Any Time Organizer Deluxe</a>.</p>

<p>A business-level, to-do organizer, Any Time syncs between PCs and mobile devices through Google and Outlook, and it includes over 2,500 templates for to-do lists and calendars. One of the apps most helpful features is the ability to send text reminders directly to your mobile device.</p>

<h2>Phone Scanners in Small Businesses</h2>

<p>A business trip requires you to collect and organize reams of small, easy-to-lose paper documents, such as receipts for travel expenses, notes, business cards and agreements.</p>

<p>You can purchase 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Scanners/cat_CL158948">pocket-sized scanners</a> to record these items, or you can simply install a scanner app on your smartphone. Scanner apps use the phone's camera to make copies of documents, which can then be organized, tagged, emailed and uploaded to cloud storage. Some scanner apps can also merge information scanned from business cards with your existing contacts list.</p>

<h2>Business-Class Video Conferencing</h2>

<p>A tablet with a front-facing camera can double as a take-anywhere video conferencing device through services such as Google Talk for Android tablets. Business travel increasingly requires people be in two places at once: with video conferencing, you can take part in your weekly board meeting in Boston from a hotel room in California.</p>

<h2>Multi-Person Texting in the Office</h2>

<p>Watch a teenager text on a cell phone, her fingers a blur as they move across the tiny keyboard. Todays youth consider texting as important a means of communication as speech, and much more effective than old-fashioned emails. As todays text-centric college students move into the business world, theyre going to continue to use texts as a primary form of communication.</p>

<p>Like it or not, a forward-looking businessperson should acknowledge that texting will become an integral part of business life in the near future. While you may not be able to match a teenagers text-typing speed, you can at least use apps to make texting less laborious. 
<a href="http://textplus.com">TextPlus</a>, for instance, allows you to send texts to up to 20 different people simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Personal Projectors</h2>

<p>Tablets are all about audio-visual experiences: You play  games on them, watch movies, and listen to streaming music. Harness those same graphics to turn your tablet into a presentation powerhouse. Real-estate agents were quick to grasp this possibility  a tablet allows an agent to make an intimate presentation to one or two people over coffee.</p>

<p>Tablets can also give presentations to larger groups by connecting to computers, televisions or hand-held 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Projectors-Screens-Pointers/cat_DP1446">mobile projectors</a>. You not only have the ability to quickly set up multi-person presentations with tablets, you also send a strong message that you (and by extension, your company) are comfortable and proficient with the latest technology.</p>

<h2>The Smartphone as Document Reader</h2>

<p>Your smartphone can double as an e-reader, as can your tablet. Applications such as Documents to Go and Quick Office Pro support Microsoft Office and Apple iWork, allowing you to read and edit documents directly from your mobile device.</p>

<p>You can stay up to date on your business journals through mobile devices as well, by signing up for newsreader apps offered by publications such as the Wall Street Journal. Given the small screen size of a smartphone, you might consider setting the phone to block images and only display text.</p>

<h2>Remote PC Desktop Apps</h2>

<p>Its Murphy's Law. You're meeting with a client, and she asks a question that you could answer easily, but the file you need is on your office computer. Delaying answering such questions slows the business process, and, frankly, makes you look bad. Its embarrassing to admit you dont have the information at your fingertips.</p>

<p>With a remote desktop app for your smartphone, however, thats exactly where your office computer files are  your fingertips. The app, such as 
<a href="http://secure.logmein.com/">LogMeIn</a>, connects your phone to your office computer, allowing you to access files from a distance.</p>

<h2>Cloud Computing Services and Your Tablet</h2>

<p>Like remote desktop apps, cloud services allow you immediate access to vital documents, no matter where you are. Instead of documents residing on your own computer network,  they are stored remotely.</p>

<p>Cloud storage offers advantages for the smartphone-equipped businessperson. Mobile devices can access cloud documents as needed. This adds a layer of security to business trips: You dont need to travel with sensitive documents on your mobile devices. Should a thief make off with your smartphone, cloud storage reduces the risk of security breaches.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/cloud-services-crash-course-2/">Cloud services</a> also allow for collaboration on documents from multiple users in different locations. You can read, edit and comment on documents from wherever you are.</p>

<h2>Dictation Applications</h2>

<p>Most smartphones and tablets come with a microphone, and offer at least some audio recording capabilities. You can take those abilities to the next level with dictation apps. A standard dictation app like 
<a href="http://nuance.com/dragon/index.htm">Dragonspeak</a> allows you to record notes, organize them, and email them to recipients.</p>

<p>Ultimately, how effectively you use mobile devices for business depends on you. For many  businesspeople, a tablet will remain nothing more than a pleasant, time-passing device. Businesses that learn to capitalize on mobile devices, however, uncover a hidden world of productivity.</p>

<title>New Tech ROI: How Do I Know If an Upgrade Is Worth It?</title>
<description>Sooner or later, every computer starts breaking down. Find out when its time to stop fixing things that are going wrong  and to start shopping for a new PC.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Sooner or later, every computer starts breaking down. Find out when its time to stop fixing things that are going wrong  and to start shopping for a new PC.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nothing lasts forever. If theres one thing weve learned from the countless generations of technology that have raised and shattered our hopes, its this. Even the best-designed and fastest new computers inevitably will succumb to the passage of time. All those shiny parts break, wear out and eventually need replacing.</p>

<p>The real question is what to do about it. When is a part worth repairing, and when should it be replaced completely? How do you know when its time to stop with the upkeep and go for an upgrade instead?</p>

<p>In this column, we address these age-old questions, examining the decline and fall of your various computer parts and deciding when the ROI on that PC is DOA.</p>

<h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/easytech-explains-lets-talk-memory-4/">RAM</a> is the most interchangeable of all your computers parts. If youre suffering with a sudden slowdown in performance, one or more of your RAM chips may have failed. The good news is that you can often 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/walkthrough-galleries/easytechs-visual-ram-adventure.html">click in a newer RAM module</a> without much hassle. New RAM can bring other benefits as well, such as higher speeds and more memory.</p>

<p>Check your manual to see how many slots, or DIMMs, you have under the hood of your machine. If your motherboard can handle some of the faster RAM chips, you're in luck. Consider doubling your RAM (or more) if you're already inside the chassis..</p>

<p>
<em>Ease of replacement: 8 out of 10. (Want to see RAM replacement in action? Our visual 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/walkthrough-galleries/easytechs-visual-ram-adventure.html">RAM replacement gallery</a> walks you through the entire process.)</em></p>

<h2>Graphics Card</h2>

<p>Many newer computers also come with built-in graphics capability, eliminating the need for an additional 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/easytech-explains-lets-talk-memory-4/">graphics card</a>. Low- to mid-level PCs use these cards for menial rendering tasks such as watching online videos and running Skype. Higher-end PCs require dedicated 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/walkthrough-galleries/the-visual-card-installation-experience.html">graphics cards</a> to run media-intensive applications, like Aftereffects and advanced gaming.</p>

<p>Consider what youll use the card for before buying the latest and the greatest. After all, you may not need it. Even low-end graphics cards can easily handle full-screen video chat, high-def media clips and some basic video editing.</p>

<p>
<em>Ease of replacement: 6.</em></p>

<h2>The Processor</h2>

<p>What if the computer just stops working? One of the most common culprits in a total breakdown is the computer chip, or central processing unit (CPU). If this fails, all bets are off; the CPU is the engine that runs everything your computer can do.</p>

<p>Motherboards, which are large cards made from silicon and located where the CPU lives, are designed specifically to handle the architecture of certain chips, so swapping out one for another is rarely a good idea. If you simply must upgrade this component, be sure to check all the techy details (e.g., pin configuration and power rating) before you install. Our opinion: When the chip dies, its time for a new computer.</p>

<p>
<em>Ease of replacement: 1, and not recommended without professional assistance.</em></p>

<h2>The Router</h2>

<p>And if the router dies? Small-business owners are constantly being inundated with an alphabet soup of wireless protocols and security guidance. Should you go with 802.11b, 802.11g or the extra-fancy 802.11n? Whats the deal with WEP (Wire Equivalent Privacy) versus WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)? Why are so many routers rated for 150 feet when their signal can barely make it past the water cooler?</p>

<p>Ultimately, you should base your decision on a single factor: What do you need? Its true that wireless signals get faster as you move down the alphabet  and that 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/easytech-debunks-the-biggest-wireless-networking-myths.html">WPA is far more secure than WEP</a>. When in doubt, go with the industry standard in wireless speed, which is currently 802.11n.</p>

<p>
<em>Ease of replacement: 9.</em></p>

<h2>Wireless Networking Cards</h2>

<p>The router is merely the hub of your network; much of the heavy lifting goes on at each laptop and tablet. When you upgrade the router, always upgrade the wireless cards in your connected devices for seamless compatibility.</p>

<p>Wireless networking cards can easily be swapped in and out of laptops, so its always worth an upgrade if something breaks. For other wireless devices that cant be repaired so easily, such as older e-readers and phones, its better to invest in a new device than send them in for repairs.</p>

<p>
<em>Ease of replacement: 7.</em></p>

<h2>Office and Productivity Software</h2>

<p>And what about the software that runs your business, like Microsoft Office? Small-business owners follow a predictable, emotional cycle every time a new version of their favorite application is released. First comes denial. Then resistance. And then, as the pressure mounts to attach the latest suffix to their new documents and media, the inevitable cave.</p>

<p>Thankfully, most office software is upgradable for free (though your employees may still have to take the time to learn a new interface). If your existing software fails altogether, invest in the most recent version of any program you need. Youll buy yourself a buffer before it all becomes obsolete once again.</p>

<p>
<em>Ease of replacement: 9.</em></p>

<h2>The Operating System</h2>

<p>Our relationship with operating systems follows the same general contours as the software saga: we resist, and then we capitulate. More often than not, a new operating system is worth the effort to upgrade. With the notable exception of Windows Vistas first release, most major platforms tend to come to market polished and stable.</p>

<p>The big concern is whether your existing hardware can handle the changes. If you love the operating system (OS) you have, or worry that your old PC might go into cardiac arrest with a more demanding OS, its okay to wait until you buy a new PC. You may also want to wait if your favorite applications are not yet rated to run on the new OS  or if youre in a busy sales cycle. Learning a new platform takes time, and often theres a dip in productivity while everyone gets on the same page. Plan accordingly.</p>

<p>
<em>Ease of replacement: 5.</em></p>

<h2>Wait, but Not Forever</h2>

<p>The bottom line for all of these decisions is money. If you can afford new products and dont anticipate any major interruptions to your workflow, newer is almost always better. Just remember the basics when you purchase: value and time.</p>

<p>Let the principles of ROI govern your decisions, and you can stay current and solvent well into the future.</p>

<title>Making Your Tech Talk: Integrating Legacy and New Equipment</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Does your office include old and new hardware together? Check out this handy guide for tips to make all those machines play nice.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lets face it: Most office networks are actually motley crews of young and old technologies patched together by a multiplying succession of wireless bridges, adapters and love. Its not unusual to see a mammoth CRT monitor one cubicle over from a sleek flatscreen, or a warhorse printer sharing shelf space with a slim-line, next-gen cousin.</p>

<p>Learning how to integrate new technologies with older hardware is essential to the churn of modern business. In this column, we discuss some of the more reliable ways you can bring lasting harmony to that May-December romance between your printer and PC  and what to do when the magic is gone for good.</p>

<h2>Monitors</h2>

<p>Newer monitors have their own connections and power ratings, but you can usually hook them into an older system with an adapter. Even the latest models tend to support the big multi-pin jacks known as DVI and VGA (alongside the newer HDMI), so you can almost certainly add them to your existing hardware setup with little difficulty. If you dont have the right jack on hand, look for a simple plug-in adapter. Handy choices like 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Staples-DVI-I-to-VGA-Adapter/product_837520">this</a> and 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Belkin-6-HDMI-to-DVI-Video-Cable/product_764287">this</a> are easy to install.</p>

<h2>Printers</h2>

<p>What if that old printer has finally kicked the bucket and you want something faster and more efficient? Many newer printers come with wireless connectivity built in, saving you from the headache of patching together different jacks and plugs.</p>

<p>But what if your old computer cant find the printer, or you want to reverse these roles and connect an older printer to a newer network? Cloud printing is the answer. Online services such as 
<a href="http://google.com/cloudprint">Google Cloud Print</a> let you print from anywhere, to anywhere, regardless of hardware. Its an elegant solution that enables you to bypass driver installation, putting your documents on paper with just one step.</p>

<h2>Peripherals</h2>

<p>One of the most common legacy hardware items is the keyboard. Professionals, especially writers, can become attached to their keyboard of choice. Even in this age of whisper-quiet key travel and wireless typing, there remain diehards who favor the clicky keys and bulky wires of yore. For them and for you, good solutions abound. Serial connections (of the sort most of us used until a few years ago) can be converted to USB jacks with a simple adapter like 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Staples-USB-to-PS-2-Adapter/product_837523">this</a>. Works for mice as well.</p>

<h2>Routers</h2>

<p>Routers are some of the simplest devices to integrate with hardware, old or new. Hanging on to an older router for sentimental reasons is rarely a good idea, as wireless protocols are getting faster all the time, and a simple upgrade could bump your connection speed by a factor of 100.</p>

<p>But what if you want to integrate a new router with an older network? Most of these devices are backward-compatible, making it easy to connect them to older PCs and laptops. Just make sure that your router says this explicitly; if youre buying an 802.11n, for instance, double-check that it can downshift to 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>One of the biggest concerns for business owners when they upgrade their PCs is the software: What happens to all those programs that you rely on every day?</p>

<p>Chances are, the same programs are already available on the newest operating system, though you may need to call and transfer a license manually if reinstalling doesnt do the trick. What if you simply must continue using the same version of the same program on an incompatible platform? Workarounds are often available, but they might require you to make some techy tweaks such as running a virtual PC inside your existing computer. Our advice: 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/get-help-now/">get expert help</a>.</p>

<h2>Files</h2>

<p>Files themselves tend to arouse similar anxiety. Simply backing up from one PC to another is a relatively simple proposition: Get an external drive, drag and drop, and repeat.</p>

<p>But what do you do with files that have been orphaned, or transferred without the right application to open them? The best way to avoid this issue is to save everything in common file formats (such as .doc and .pdf) before you toss that old PC. A number of online services can also convert old file formats with just one click.</p>

<h2>Mobile Devices</h2>

<p>Finally, we come to mobile devices such as tablets, smartphones and laptops. If youve recently invested in a suite of new mobile hardware and want it to play nice with the existing network, you should be in the clear. Nearly all such devices are backward-compatible just like routers, which means they can find and process any kind of local network signal.</p>

<p>The reverse generally holds true for older wireless devices as well; the slowest device on any Wi-Fi network can usually transfer data at its own speed without necessitating a universal downgrade across the network. That means you can hang on to that old phone or laptop until it dies.</p>

<h2>Dont Sweat It</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, the folks who design and agree upon new tech standards almost always insist on backward compatibility as a matter of course. Data is data, and most hardware connects through a few simple protocols, making it easy to integrate and upgrade your machines slowly over time. And for those moments when youre trying to stick a square peg into a round hole, your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com">local office supply store</a> should carry the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>EasyTech tells you why  and how  you should salvage your files from outmoded storage systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are you trapped in the past when it comes to data backup? If youre still saving documents, photos, videos and other media to CD or DVD (hello, 1995?) or even (cough) floppy disks, then this article is for you.</p>

<p>But we dont want to sound too harsh. After all, its great that you've developed the backup habit. That will serve you well when deciding on a new, more reliable way to back up your stuff. Read on for the lowdown on why and how to rescue those files stashed away in dusty corners, in crumpled shoeboxes or on old PCs.</p>

<h2>Ditch the Disk Approach</h2>

<p>For an idea of where were coming from, check out some of the funny videos produced by 
<a href="http://iosafe.com">ioSafe</a>, which makes tough-as-nails external hard drives. The videos show indestructible ioSafe drives surviving floods, fires, and even the crunching wheels of a tractor.</p>

<p>Well assume you dont park your backup system behind the barn, so losing your data to a run-in with farm equipment might not be your most pressing concern. But the message is an important one: Dont waste time and effort backing up your stuff, only to see it damaged or disintegrated by an unfortunate accident, an act of nature or the simple passage of time.</p>

<p>Even if  youre storing your disks in a safe spot, out of the reach of thieves and your curious preschooler, the discs are at risk. After just a few years, disks can begin to degrade and lose their data. Extreme temperatures, humidity and handling are all possible culprits. Plus, disks take up a lot of space.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that even modern data-storage technologies, like flash memory and platter-based hard drives, can fail or degrade over time. So, whether youre storing your wedding pictures or crucial business data, developing a strategy for a more secure backup system is your best move.</p>

<p>As you mull over your possibilities for backing up files, keep a few rules in mind:
1.    Be open to paying (a little) for security and simplicity.
2.    Use more than one strategy, including offsite storage.
3.    Give serious consideration to cloud services for the ultimate backup.</p>

<h2>Go Way Beyond the Floppy</h2>

<p>The best ways to back up your stuff today?  Lets look at the basic onsite and offsite options.</p>

<p>
<strong>Physical drives</strong>: The new breeds of external hard drives are fast and tough. They hold a ton of data, and with prices falling fast, theyre a great bargain for backing up the stuff that matters. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/External-Hard-Drives-Hard-Drives-USB-Drives-DVD-Burners/cat_CL160403">Solid-state drives</a> (
<strong>SSDs</strong>) use integrated circuits to store your data, making them far less vulnerable to damage than the platform drive thats probably supporting your PC.</p>

<p>The introduction of mega-capacity tetrabyte drives, meanwhile, means one little box can hold all the material on those hundreds of CDs and DVDs cluttering up your library, and then some.</p>

<p>
<strong>Cloud storage</strong>: Cloud services are wildly popular for a reason: Theyre a great idea. As the 
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/technology/personaltech/03basics.html?_r=3">
<em>New York Times</em> notes</a>, "Storing your files in a distant commercial data center, encrypted and secure, increasingly makes more sense."</p>

<p>The desire for more secure backup is often the very thing that drives small-business owners and individuals to look to the cloud. Companies like 
<a href="http://carbonite.com">Carbonite</a>, 
<a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> and 
<a href="http://mozy.com">Mozy</a> have made online storage simple, affordable and utterly reliable. And because theyre offsite and super-secure, theyre immune to threats that can devastate a physical backup  system, like theft and fire.</p>

<h2>The Logistics: Getting It from Here to There</h2>

<p>Lets say you have some precious files and emails trapped on an ancient machine thats on its last legs. If youre imagining yourself chained to a desk chair, searching for and copying data over to your new PC, dont panic. Thanks to the latest technology, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/walkthrough-galleries/an-inside-look-at-data-transfer.html">data transfer</a> from old machine to new is safe, simple and affordable  and very quick if you 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/get-help-now/">turn the goods over</a> to the experts.</p>

<p>If you do tap a tech expert for data transfer services, he or she will need to open the casing on your old PC and carefully remove the hard drive. The old hard drive is then plugged into a power source and connected to your new machine with a data transfer cable.</p>

<p>Software built  into your new PCs operating system manages the actual transfer and, voilà, all of that old data is granted a second life on your new machine. In fact, data transfers can even salvage files that you might have thought were lost or damaged.</p>

<h2>What Are You Waiting For?</h2>

<p>As these terrific new ways to back up data grow even more popular, your opportunities to access those old data-storage forms are only going to shrink. (How many new PCs do you see with a floppy disk drive?) Dont wait for your outdated backup system to get any older or fall prey to a heat wave or water damage.</p>

<p>Whether youre talking about heirloom photos or business data, now is the time to act. Move the content of those disks or old PC someplace safe, and massage that dated DVD backup routine into one thats really going to work for you in the long term.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is your computer being used as a tool of cyberterrorism without your knowledge? Learn how to protect yourself from Flame and other super-viruses.</p></blockquote>

<p>At some point, most of us have had run-in with a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/infographs/virus-vs-virus-a-visual-battle-royale.html">computer virus.</a> Weve gone to a website we shouldnt have or downloaded an attachment from an email, and suddenly our PC is acting funny. The computer is running more slowly, we get annoying pop-up ads or the PC might crash.</p>

<p>These viruses are destructive and can be costly, but the damage they do is often limited. A good virus-removal tool and updating your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Computer-Software/StaplesCategoryDisplay?catalogIdentifier=2&amp;amp;languageId=-1&amp;amp;identifier=CG5&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;redirectrule=CL140492&amp;amp;redirecttype=auto">antivirus program</a> usually fix the problem. Recent viruses have come to light, however, that are far more complex, powerful and sinister, and for which any one of us may be an unsuspecting carrier.</p>

<p>These super-viruses have the capacity to record keystrokes, take screenshots or even listen in on our audio and Skype conversations. All of our data, business and personal, is at risk. PCs that carry the virus may even be involved in cyberterrorism, without their owners knowledge.</p>

<h2>The Flame Virus and Other Baddies</h2>

<p>You might have heard about the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/flame-wars-espionage-malware-and-the-small-business.html">Flame virus</a>, the malware that has been attacking computers across the world, particularly in the Middle East. This malware spreads by taking advantage of weaknesses in a PCs operating system through unprotected networks and USB flash drives. Once on a computer, the virus communicates with its home base, receiving instructions from hackers to steal data and record PC activity.</p>

<p>This virus was able to spread without detection for two years or longer, slipping under the radar of antivirus software and the diligence of IT experts the world over. Even now, computers without malware protection or the latest updates may be harboring the virus.</p>

<p>Although Flame appears to be directed against governments and large corporations and is the work of sophisticated and well funded people, the worry is that such capabilities will soon fall into the hands of the average cyber criminal, putting businesses of all sizes at risk. In fact, it is possible that viruses like Flame are already out there, on our PCs, stealing our data or using our computers as terrorist tools.</p>

<h2>Protecting Yourself
<strong>
</strong></h2>

<p>Every person who owns a computer should know how important antivirus software is. Such protection, when updated regularly, will keep your business PCs free from most known viruses. The addition of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29">firewall</a> and data encryption will keep hackers from slipping into your network (many storage solutions and wireless routers include encryption tools as standard features). Now that the characteristics of Flame are known, a simple scan can identify and remove the malware.</p>

<p>The trick, however, is protecting yourself from viruses that have not yet been discovered and that may be lurking out there even now. Staving off these infections will require you to stay on the alert, watching for signs of unusual activity on your computer.</p>

<p>Use your Task Manager to look for unusual processes running in the background or communication with suspicious IP addresses. Monitor data flowing into, out of and through your network. For more about these technical tasks, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/talk-to-an-easytech/">speak with an expert</a> who will tell you how to watch your network for signs of danger.</p>

<p>Flame and other super-viruses may represent a new threat to the business owner, but you 
<em>can</em> protect your computers.</p>

<title>Password Perfect: How Password Management Software Improves Security</title>
<description>Remembering multiple passwords can be frustrating. Make your life easier with password-management software.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Remembering multiple passwords can be frustrating. Make your life easier with password-management software.</p></blockquote>

<p>Juggling multiple passwords challenges even the best memory. Each password ought to be at least 15 characters long and a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. The password has to look random  password-cracking software spots real words quickly by checking multiple language dictionaries. And to make things worse, IT departments often require regular password changes, so just when youve got one password memorized, you have to come up with a new one.</p>

<p>Small wonder that many people throw up their hands in despair and start taking password shortcuts, such as using the same password for multiple websites, or using easy-to-remember passwords like their names, birthdates or family pet names. These strategies may make it easier to remember your passwords, but leave you vulnerable to hackers and malware.</p>

<p>Youve got two solutions to this problem. You can improve your passwords, finding some way of remembering them that doesnt involve writing them down on an easily stolen sheet of paper. Or you can use password-management software, which remembers all your passwords for you.</p>

<h2>Features of Password Managers</h2>

<p>A password manager stores your passwords using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The U.S. Government has used AES since 2001. In addition, the password manager should have a master password that you use to access the system. The system should also auto-fill names and passwords and be compatible with your browser and operating system.</p>

<p>The software must be able to identify password changes and associate them with appropriate websites. In todays world of mobile devices, you also want a password manager that works with your phone or tablet.</p>

<p>Depending on the software, a password manager may offer other features, including auto-fill for online forms, easy import and export features, and multiple-user options. Many also include password generators that help you make long, secure passwords.</p>

<p>Security is, of course, vital where passwords are concerned. A password manager may include a virtual keyboard to foil 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/what-is-keylogging.html">keyloggers</a> (malware that records your typing). Others include one-time passwords for use on unsecured, public WiFi networks.</p>

<h2>Password Manager Disadvantages</h2>

<p>Password managers are not perfect. With dozens on the market, and even more open-source programs available, quality varies widely. Even the best managers have a potentially fatal flaw, and as so often happens, the vulnerability lies between the software and the user.</p>

<p>The problem occurs during installation, when the software asks users to establish program settings. Too often, people opt for convenience over security, choosing easy-access settings that leave their passwords vulnerable to attack. Opt for the most stringent settings: After all, youre using the software to protect yourself.</p>

<h2>Browser Password Managers</h2>

<p>You may wonder why, with many browsers offering password-protection features, you cant just rely on your web browser to remember passwords. Unfortunately, password protection built into browsers usually isnt very thorough. While such features can be relied on to auto-fill passwords, the quality of security is open to debate.</p>

<h2>Recommended Password Managers</h2>

<p>While a host of password managers vies for your attention, youll see the same software recommended time after time on tech blogs and review sites. These programs show up for a reason: they work.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://lastpass.com">LastPass</a> is a cloud-based password manager you can access from any device. The program does not store your master password, and encrypts passwords before sending them. Because the software is online, you wouldnt be able to access your passwords if the cloud server goes down (an unlikely, but possible, event).</p>

<p>If you prefer to store your passwords on your hard drive, consider 
<a href="http://roboform.com">Roboform</a> for Windows devices or 
<a href="http://agilebits.com/onepassword">Mac 1Password</a> for Macs, iPads and iPhones. Both are easy to use and are available at a reasonable cost. If youd rather use a free, open-source program, consider 
<a href="http://keepass.info">KeePass</a>. Bear in mind, however, that KeePass requires users to have more computer knowledge than the other programs listed here.</p>

<p>Finally, remember that passwords, while important, are only one aspect of computer security. Keeping your antiviral programs and operating systems updated with the latest patches is just as important.</p>

<p>Be more productive and get organized with these top small-business apps.</p></blockquote>

<p>Making the most of your small business means getting organized, being more productive and trouncing the competition.</p>

<p>Business savvy goes a long way, but everyone needs a little help, too. Here are some top mobile apps that will boost your enterprise agility.</p>

<h2>Abukai Expenses</h2>

<p>Creating expense reports can be time-consuming and dull, but 
<a href="http://abukai.com/?id=expense reports">Abukai</a> makes it a lot easier (and even more pleasant). Simply take a photo of your receipt from your smartphone, and the information is entered into one of the apps interfaces. You can also take a picture of a map or itinerary to record mileage. All the data then populates a spreadsheet or Web-based interface.</p>

<h2>OfficeTime</h2>

<p>For freelance professionals or others who bill by the hour, tracking time can often take the form of scribbled notes or shorthand on a calendar page. Spruce up your system with 
<a href="http://officetime.net">OfficeTime</a>, an app geared toward small businesses and freelancers. Now, you can not only track time spent on a project, but also see cross-team reporting. That means you can determine whos slacking and which project is over budget.</p>

<h2>Primadesk</h2>

<p>Cloud computing makes data storage and access much easier, but only if the information is organized in a searchable way. 
<a href="http://primadesk.com">Primadesk</a> offers an app that lets users manage cloud content, look through older files, transfer new files and even combine cloud services like Dropbox, SugarSync, Access Box and others. Using a single interface, you can zip through your content and boost productivity by locating data quickly.</p>

<h2>SOS Online Backup</h2>

<p>Online backup is essential for any small business, and theres an array of options when it comes to mobile computing backup. A top example is 
<a href="http://sosonlinebackup.com">SOS Online Backup</a>, which offers access from any Web browser and any device. The app works continuously, backing up files as they change. Especially nice is the military-grade encryption, a security level thats sometimes lacking in small-business apps.</p>

<h2>Evernote</h2>

<p>Imagine all your brilliant ideas in one place. With 
<a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>, you can jot down your thoughts  or speak them into your smartphone  and keep track of your insights. The app allows you to organize and share text, photos and voice notes; bookmark web pages; and then search through all the content quickly. When trying to recall that huge business idea, youll never be scrambling through your desk again.</p>

<h2>TripIt</h2>

<p>Three connecting flights, car rental and hotel reservation: Is your briefcase bulging with email printouts yet? Ditch the paper with 
<a href="http://tripit.com">TripIt</a>, an app that lets you combine all your flight, hotel and rental-car confirmations into one mobile itinerary. The app also features maps so you can navigate unfamiliar roads on your way to important business meetings, making that travel-induced anxiety a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Mobile computing helps any small business get more accomplished, faster  and that can lead to increased growth and revenue. Tap into the power of apps for a business power boost.</p>

<p>Are you taking valuable minutes sorting through your apps collection every day? Here are some tips to help you get organized.</p></blockquote>

<p>When your mobile device or laptop begins to look like the digital version of Hoarders, it might be time for some intervention. Fortunately, there are ways to take control. Here are a few options to clean up your apps:</p>

<p>    Organize by action instead of category. As detailed by tips site Lifehacker, a good management system can depend on how you use apps, rather than their general category. For example, social media can be grouped under share and games under play. This creates a more intuitive system based on how you use the apps.</p>

<p>    Take time to create folders. Depending on the platform, youll have organization tools already built into the system, so take advantage of those resources. Although the process can be tedious, it will pay off in saved time when youre looking for a specific app.</p>

<p>    Clean out the clutter. Maybe theres an app that you used to love, but never access anymore, or a game thats lost its luster. While youre shuffling apps to various files, be ruthless in removing less-used apps. If youre unsure of what to delete, sort apps by size and see whats taking up the most space. Then determine if theyre worth the storage.</p>

<p>Not every app store is a secure place to shop. Know some best practices before you begin downloading with these handy tips.</p></blockquote>

<p>Finding fun or useful new apps is part of the joy of device and laptop ownership, but not all app sources are trustworthy. Heres a best-practices checklist to keep you safe as you shop:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Research the app publisher. </strong>Take a look at other apps available from the developer or publisher to get a sense of what else theyre offering. If any of the apps look sketchy, shop elsewhere.</li>

<li>
<strong>Take time to read user reviews.</strong> In the app world, users are very vocal about what they like (or dont like). See what theyre saying, and also do a search for other online reviews from technology news sites.</li>

<li>
<strong>Do a Google search using the app name.</strong> If theres been a malware issue with the app, it likely will pop up in the top results.</li>

<li>
<strong>Read through app permissions information first. </strong>Whenever you download an app, youll get a list of permissions  take the time to read through it. Determine if the app is asking for more personal data than its function requires. For example, if a stock tracker needs access to your contact list, its better to find another app without that level of intrusion.</li>

<li>
<strong>Consider a malware or antivirus scanner for your smartphone.</strong> These types of mobile-security apps have been slow to catch on, but try being a pioneer. You could prevent some serious security issues as a result.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Apps are everywhere you look these days, in both the mobile and desktop arenas. Choosing them can be daunting, so heres a handy guide to help you get your bearings.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just a few years after they started appearing, apps are nearly ubiquitous in both the mobile and desktop arenas. Smartphones are chock-full of them, and even laptop and PC makers are opening up app stores for users to peruse a variety of fun and business-friendly apps.</p>

<p>If youre just setting out in this world, the sheer amount of choice can be daunting; hundreds of thousands of apps are available, regardless of platform. Heres a guide for navigating the ever-growing app landscape.</p>

<h2>Whats an App?</h2>

<p>First, some definition: an app (an abbreviation for application) is usually a specialized program thats loaded onto a mobile device or laptop.</p>

<p>Unlike large, multifunctional software applications like Microsoft Word or Outlook, an app is typically stripped down to just one function. For example, it may only track the stock market or consist of a game with simple graphics. Some apps boast multiple features, but often users prefer single-purpose apps that dont sacrifice speed for functionality.</p>

<h2>How They Work</h2>

<p>Often, apps are free or low-cost, making them very attractive to users. They range in terms of purpose and interest, and it seems like theres an app for everything these days. You can get news from CNN, update your Facebook status on the fly, input business expenses or even track your fitness goals.</p>

<p>While apps rely on an online connection for download, they dont necessarily need that link to function. Many can operate offline  for example, you might download a yoga poses deck for your next trip or a flashlight app that turns your smartphone into a camping tool  but they do need an Internet connection to be updated. Developers are constantly tweaking apps, and staying on top of these updates can prevent interoperability problems down the line.</p>

<h2>Getting Apps</h2>

<p>There are numerous online stores for apps  check first with your smartphone or device makers website. Other top stores include Google Apps Marketplace, Amazon Appstore for Android and Apples App Store.</p>

<h2>Making the Choice</h2>

<p>The tough thing about apps is that so many seem worth downloading, particularly if theyre free. Keep in mind, though, that every app is rich in software code, which means theyll take up space on your smartphone or laptop.</p>

<p>Feel free to swap out apps frequently, but also choose wisely from the start. Here are a few questions to ask when choosing:</p>

<p>    
<strong>Does the app do exactly what you need?</strong> So many apps are out there; dont settle for good enough when you can have precisely what you want.</p>

<p>    
<strong>Are you getting the app from a trusted source?</strong> Hackers love to release free apps because they can hide malicious code behind a simple game or other function.</p>

<p>    
<strong>Does your device start to act wonky soon after you download an app?</strong> Not all apps play well with others. If youre experiencing issues, delete the app and find another one that works better with your operating system.</p>

<p>Once youre comfortable with downloading a few apps, you might find yourself collecting a whole slew of them, for everything from currency conversion to mileage tracking to racing games. Chances are, youll forget what it was like to live without them.</p>

<title>What Is Printer Pooling?</title>
<description>You can make office printing more efficient through printer pooling. Find out how with help from the tech experts at Staples.</description>

<p>You can make office printing more efficient through printer pooling. Find out how with help from EasyTech.</p></blockquote>

<p>Everyone has felt the stress of trying to print an important document just as a coworker unleashes a mammoth print job. You hover over the printers output tray or rush back to your PC, impatiently checking your documents status in the print queue. Meanwhile, the printer grinds out page after page of someone elses work.</p>

<p>Printer pooling can put those days behind you  and boost efficiency in your office. Heres how.</p>

<h2>Making Printing Simpler</h2>

<p>Printer pooling is a standard feature of Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 that allows users to share printer functionality across multiple printers. This arrangement automatically routes your print job to a printer thats available.</p>

<p>Pools make better use of office resources, and save everyone time they would otherwise spend waiting for documents or canceling and resending print jobs.</p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p>Configuring a pool requires that you use two or more printers of the same model. You can add as many printers as you like, but they must all use the same type of driver (how the PC communicates with the printer) so identical printers work best. You could use a varied spread of old and new printers, but the system will be a bit more complex to manage and could be less efficient. An ideal arrangement places the printers side by side or, for large companies, in a dedicated print room. This prevents the annoyance of wandering the office in search of the printer that handled your request.</p>

<h2>Set Up Your Network in Three Steps</h2>

<p>From every computer in your network (using Windows 7):</p>

<p>    Go to the Control Panel and select Add Printer.</p>

<p>    Add each printer individually, giving each a unique name.</p>

<p>    Select all the printers youve added, click Properties and then Ports, and then check the Enable Printer Pooling box.</p>

<p>Its that simple.</p>

<p>Youll see the benefits of the pool immediately. From here on out, all requests are handled by the first available printer. Anytime a printer jams or runs out of paper or toner, another printer will take over.</p>

<p>Please note: if you need to take a printer out of the pool, you must remove it from every computer on the network.</p>

<h2>A Good Bet for Any Business</h2>

<p>Printer pools work well for offices of any size. And since Windows lets you add unlimited printers to a pool, its a solution that can grow with your business.</p>

<p>Remember that a few saved minutes a day add up quickly, so hassle-free printing can boost productivity for everyone in the office. Just dont wait until youre frantically trying to print that critical memo, meeting agenda or boarding pass to decide its time to make the switch.</p>

<p>Is your computer a zombie? Are you an unwitting part of an international criminal syndicate? Heres what you should know about botnets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even the questions sound scary: Are your business computers part of a botnet? Have your PCs been turned into zombies? Are you an unwitting part of an international crime wave? If your computers are 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-five-most-common-security-lapses-made-by-small-businesses.html">improperly protected</a>, the answer might be yes.</p>

<p>Millions of computers have been infected with malware that allows hackers to use these machines to commit crimes, usually without their owners being aware of it. However, you can defend your machines and your business from these activities.</p>

<h2>The Botnet Breakdown</h2>

<p>A few years back, hackers figured out theres strength in numbers. If one computer can send out hundreds of pieces of spam email, a thousand computers linked together can deliver spam at an unprecedented volume. Thus, the botnet was born.</p>

<p>It works like this: when you or one of your employees clicks a dangerous link, downloads infected software or watches a contaminated video, a piece of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/the-modern-malware-threat-2/">malware</a> is installed on that computer. The malware allows a cyber criminal to take control of the PC, turning it into a zombie. The PC becomes one of many linked into a network of robotsa botnet.</p>

<p>Such botnets are used by hackers in a number of ways, to send out thousands of phishing emails, to create 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/what-is-a-ddos-3.html">denial of service attacks</a> or to infect other computers for the purpose of stealing sensitive data. Your PCs can thus be recruited to pilfer credit card numbers or cause havoc in corporate or governmental websites.</p>

<h2>Is Your Computer a Zombie?</h2>

<p>Hackers exploit computers that are improperly protected, are without 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Computer-Software-Accounting-Forms-Security/StaplesCategoryDisplay?catalogIdentifier=2&amp;amp;languageId=-1&amp;amp;identifier=CG5&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;redirectrule=CL140492&amp;amp;redirecttype=auto">antivirus software </a>or are connected to the Internet without firewalls. Given the nature of botnets, the first reason to suspect that youre part of one is an insecure network.</p>

<p>Two other signs of bot infection are a computer that works slower than usual and the presence of unusual applications running in the background. Check your Task Manager for applications you dont recognize.</p>

<p>The problem is that the malware installed on your computer works best when you dont know its there, so criminals have gotten good at hiding it. Malware-detection software can sniff out such viruses, although you may need to run it several times to find the really well hidden bugs.</p>

<h2>Botnet Protection</h2>

<p>As with any malware, the best way to keep your PC from becoming a zombie is to keep hackers at bay, refusing to give them access to your computers. The rule of thumb is that hackers target the weakest security first, moving on when they encounter well-defended PCs.</p>

<p>Employ proper security measures, such as installing the latest antivirus software and keeping it updated. Youll also need to install firewalls on all computers. Use of data encryption will prevent hackers from discovering passwords and network log-in information. Of course, safe computing practices are essential: stay away from high-risk websites and download software only from trusted sources.</p>

<h2>Botnet Removal</h2>

<p>Should you find yourself a zombie, there are remedies, although some can be quite drastic. Computers too badly infected may need to have their hard drives wiped clean, reinforcing the need to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/entry-level-data-protection-2/">always back up your data</a>. Fortunately, many businesses can use virus-removal software to clean their computers, or enlist the services of malware professionals.</p>

<p>We can stop the spread of botnets with a bit of prevention.</p>

<p>Which mobile technology might be right for your small business?</p></blockquote>

<p>Being available anytime, anywhere can be a boost for any small-business owner or executive. However, deciding on which device to take along can be a challenge.</p>

<p>Do you go for the smartphone, with its smaller size and calling capability, or opt for the fuller-featured tablet? Both are strong contenders. When making the choice, here are some factors to consider.</p>

<h2>Smartphones</h2>

<p>There are plenty of smartphones on the market, with a wide array of operating systems, such as the Windows Phone, Apples iPhone, RIMs BlackBerry and Googles Android.</p>

<h2>Strengths</h2>

<p>    You can make phone calls and use other calling features like speakerphone.</p>

<p>    Text messaging is a breeze.</p>

<p>    Smaller size makes the device easier to slip in a pocket or a bag.</p>

<p>    Increasingly sophisticated hardware is giving smartphones more power and speed.</p>

<p>    You can take advantage of basic computing functions like email and Web browsing.</p>

<p>    Its easy to take photos and videos and then share them across social-media accounts.</p>

<p>    The price is usually lower than that of a tablet computer.</p>

<h2>Drawbacks</h2>

<p>    Web surfing can be a pain on such a small screen, especially if you need information quickly.</p>

<p>    Theres less processing speed than with tablets.</p>

<h2>Tablets</h2>

<p>Unlike laptops, mobile tablet computers are often operated through a touchscreen interface. Examples include the Apple iPad, Windows Surface, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Sony Tablet and Google Nexus 7.</p>

<h2>Strengths</h2>

<p>    The larger size makes Web browsing far easier than with a smartphone.</p>

<p>    The wider keyboard makes for easier typing.</p>

<p>    Documents or book pages appear in their full form, enhancing the reading experience.</p>

<p>    Presentations can be launched right from the device.</p>

<p>    You can take advantage of video-call capability via services like 
<a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>.</p>

<p>    You get higher resolution for movies or streaming media.</p>

<p>    You get more processing power and faster performance than with most smartphones.</p>

<h2>Drawbacks</h2>

<p>    The larger size means you cant put it in your pocket as easily as a smartphone.</p>

<p>    Those who want a full keyboard might be frustrated by the tablets limitations.</p>

<p>    Often, a tablet is more expensive than buying a smartphone.</p>

<p>    Because youll always need a phone, including a tablet in the mix means carting around multiple devices.</p>

<h2>Combo</h2>

<p>Of course, you can always opt to carry both a smartphone and a tablet to eliminate the downsides of each type of device. Although this might require more toggling between the two, the dual-type strategy will keep you connected more effectively.</p>

<p>If youre going with this idea, just be sure to synchronize the two devices often, if not automatically. Make sure that calendars, contacts and other vital information match up; this will keep you from searching for numbers or missing appointments.</p>

<p>The smartphone vs. tablet decision is never an easy one. Once you decide, however, you get to do the fun stuff: purchasing a new device and loading it with apps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Employ some do-it-yourself technology strategy with these tactics from EasyTech.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many small businesses that need to send data to different locations quickly, easily and securely count on File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers.</p>

<p>At first, it may be hard to understand how secure FTP (SFTP) servers work. But try to be patient  theyre ideal for intrepid, do-it-yourself types who want to save money and time by setting up their own systems.</p>

<p>Here are some tips on making your SFTP server installation work like a charm:</p>

<h2>Use Secure Shell</h2>

<p>Secure Shell, also known as SSH, is a program that allows you to log into another computer remotely and securely so you can move files around. By using SSH, you can turn your Windows computer into an SFTP server more easily (UNIX-based systems like Linux and OSX come with SSH pre-installed).</p>

<p>To download the client, go to 
<a href="http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net">SSHWindows</a>, an open-source project that provides a handy installer of OpenSSH, a free tool for SSH connectivity.</p>

<h2>Read the Manual</h2>

<p>We know its more fun to play around with a new program or toy than to read the instruction manual, but sometimes, this little bit of upfront work saves a ton of scrambling later.</p>

<p>In this case, SSHWindows comes with an installation doc called readme.txt (usually found in C:/program files/openssh/docs) that will outline the necessary steps for setting up the passwd file. (Password is spelled without the "or"  that will allow you to set up user accounts.)</p>

<p>Passwd creation is fairly easy, and you can tap into two programs included with SSHWindows called mkgroup and mkpasswd, found in the C:/program files/openssh/bin directory.</p>

<h2>Download an FTP Client</h2>

<p>In order to connect to your SFTP server, youll need an FTP client that can work with the new protocols. Many business users and home-technology gurus prefer 
<a href="http://www.filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a>, another open-source project geared toward boosting security and networking power. FileZilla features both a client and a server, and offers support services through its online forums. Another free option is 
<a href="http://winscp.net">WinSCP</a>, a client for SFTP that can be downloaded quickly.</p>

<h2>Test the Server</h2>

<p>You should make sure the server is running well before depending on it. To run a test, create a new connection in your client and choose SFTP as the server type, with 22 as the port.</p>

<p>For the server name, specify localhost or 127.0.0.1, and provide the user account and password you added to the passwd file. Connect to the server, and if all is running as it should, you should see a directory listing. If thats not happening, make sure your firewall lets you run traffic over port 22, since that could be the roadblock.</p>

<h2>Get Started!</h2>

<p>Setting up an SFTP server can be a rewarding and affordable task, particularly for those who are comfortable tweaking their technology stack on their own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dont fall asleep when it comes to smartphone security. These devices can be as vulnerable to threats as any computer can be.</p></blockquote>

<p>Make no mistake; your smartphone is a computer. You check your email on your smartphone, log into your financial accounts and connect with your companys network through these mobile devices. And like any computer, your smartphone is 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/state-of-security-address-todays-pc-malware-and-spyware-landscape.html">vulnerable</a>  to viruses, malware and hackers.</p>

<p>As a smartphone owner, and a small-business operator whose employees use smartphones, you need to know the threats these devices are open to and how to nip these issues in the bud. Your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/do-this-now-define-your-mobile-security-policy.html">companys security</a> depends on it.</p>

<h2>Threats to Smartphones Are on the Rise</h2>

<p>The bad news is trickling out: Cyber criminals are targeting smartphone users, with security threats to these mobile devices more than doubling in 2011. Hackers are well aware of how many people now use smartphones, and how much can be gained by forcing entry into such devices and stealing the information they contain.</p>

<p>    
<strong>Malware.</strong> Just as with PCs, smartphones are 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/new-malware-threats-take-shape-in-2012-3.html">vulnerable to malware</a>, insidious software that burrows into your devices operating system to extract information, track your activity and even jump from your smartphone to your PC when you dock the devices later. Some malware can use a vulnerable smartphone to gain access to a company network, exposing you to large-scale data theft.</p>

<p>As with PCs, hackers often depend on smartphone users to aid them in their work, waiting for you to download infected apps, click on harmful links in text messages or emails or surf the web using insecure Wi-Fi connections.</p>

<p>    
<strong>Viruses.</strong> Smartphones have not yet been subjected to many large-scale viral attacks, mostly because these devices use a variety of operating systems, limiting the effectiveness of one-size-fits-all viruses. Nonetheless, smartphones are vulnerable, and some experts predict increased viral attacks as hackers focus more on system weaknesses.</p>

<p>    
<strong>Phishing.</strong> Phishing is when criminals trick users into volunteering sensitive information (theyre phishing for personal data). Phishing schemes are alive and well in the smartphone universe. In such schemes, emails or texts that appear to come from banks or credit card companies ask for account numbers and other personal details. As an added twist, hackers may first compromise your smartphone to extract basic information and make their queries look more legitimate.</p>

<h2>Shoring Up Smartphone Vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>If your companys smartphones havent been victimized by these threats, thats excellent news, but it shouldnt lull you to sleep regarding network and data security. An unprotected smartphone is a serious liability. Any protection you provide to your PCs should be extended to your smartphones as well:</p>

<p>    
<strong>Virus and malware protection.</strong> Each smartphone that accesses your network should be equipped with the latest virus protection software. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Computer-Software-Accounting-Forms-Security/cat_CG5">Regular updates are required</a>.</p>

<p>    
<strong>Data encryption.</strong> All data sent to and from smartphones should be encrypted to prevent theft and to stop hackers from listening in as passwords and log-in info are transmitted. Firewalls should also be installed.</p>

<p>    
<strong>Smartphone locking.</strong> Smartphones can be lost or stolen, and thus all devices should be equipped with auto-locking and passwords. Also, equip phones with remote data-wiping capability.</p>

<p>
<strong>Employee education.</strong> Employees using smartphones should be made aware that their devices are as vulnerable to threats as their computers. They should know that downloading unauthorized apps, opening suspicious emails or clicking links in text messages can be dangerous. Any requests for personal or company information should always be met with skepticism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lock down your mobile devices without emptying your wallet. Heres our advice for improving mobile security.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the scramble to control costs, small businesses shouldnt skimp on security. Protecting your technology, especially for 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/do-this-now-define-your-mobile-security-policy.html">mobile devices</a>, can prevent a range of tech issues in the future.</p>

<p>For creating a big-corporation security policy on a small-biz budget, follow these three simple tips:</p>

<h2>Tip #1: Employ Endpoint Encryption</h2>

<p>Think of encryption as the protections in your house. First, theres the front door and the back door, which are the main security barriers. But then you also lock the windows and perhaps keep a fireproof safe for important documents.</p>

<p>Similarly, encryption offers layer upon layer of security to make sure data stays safe. Endpoint encryption describes the controls employed at the user/endpoint level, which can include:</p>

<p>    
<strong>Full drive encryption</strong> for a laptop, to make sure its protected in case of theft or loss</p>

<p>    
<strong>File-folder encryption</strong> to protect data on a shared system, especially if several people share an environment (e.g., a cloud-based workspace)</p>

<p>    
<strong>Email encryption</strong> to protect messages and attachments</p>

<p>All of this encryption can work together, keeping a system secure and providing multiple levels of protection. Also, many of the tools and strategies are affordable, giving you robust security without busting your budget.</p>

<h2>Tip #2: Take Advantage of Free Tools</h2>

<p>Many security resources are available online. (As a first step, make sure a company is legit  some hackers use fake security programs to crack into a network or device.) Then, decide which of these options might be right for you:</p>

<p>    
<strong>System scanners</strong> that identify potential security issues inside your network or computer</p>

<p>    
<strong>Spyware killers</strong> that can cleanse a system</p>

<p>    
<strong>Attack-detection apps</strong> that determine whether your company website is under attack or being monitored by hackers</p>

<p>    
<strong>End-user license agreement (EULA) scanners</strong> that crawl through these documents on your computer to see if any hackers have tweaked a EULA to gain entry into your system</p>

<p>These resources are handy, tested and free or at least affordable (some shareware developers ask for a small donation). Take advantage of the breadth of tech savvy available to make your business more bulletproof.</p>

<h2>Tip #3: Implement Budget-Friendly Employee Policies</h2>

<p>Many companies are finding success with implementing a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/get-to-know-byod-mobile-computing-security.html">BYOD</a> (bring your own device) policy, which allows employees to use their own smartphones, laptops and tablet computers at the office.</p>

<p>Because employees purchase the devices, the cost benefits are tough to beat. Where you should put your tech dollars, then, is into security measures that protect the network when these devices are logged on. Here are some tips:</p>

<p>    
<strong>Develop an employee 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/do-this-now-define-your-mobile-security-policy.html">security policy</a></strong> that mandates encryption on all devices and prohibits installation of applications that might compromise security</p>

<p>    
<strong>Talk to employees</strong> about the importance of password-protection strategies.</p>

<p>    
<strong>Conduct occasional device audits</strong> to make sure they dont carry security risk.</p>

<p>    
<strong>Prohibit storage of company data</strong> on the devices; often, employees can access files from cloud-based services without downloading and storing them locally.</p>

<p>With BYOD policies, free tools and endpoint encryption, youll be on your way to having an efficient, affordable mobile-security program.</p>

<title>The Essential 2012 PC Security Checklist </title>
<description>Data breaches can cost you both time and money. But you can make your network secure and keep your data safe with a few simple steps.</description>

<p>Data breaches can cost you both time and money. But you can make your network secure and keep your data safe with a few simple steps.</p></blockquote>

<p>If youre a small-business owner, its essential to keep your critical data safe. Data  whether customer records, financial information or internal emails  must be protected from hackers and those who would pilfer your data for their own nefarious purposes. More and more, hackers are targeting smaller businesses, looking for holes in your network.</p>

<p>These cyber-criminals are smart, and theyve gotten very good at exploiting small gaps in your security. However, you can be smarter, and you can stop data breaches. This handy guide breaks the risks into two types  network-infrastructure risks and employee-compliance risks  and will give you the tools you need to stay ahead of the hackers.</p>

<h2>Network-Infrastructure Risks for Small Businesses</h2>

<p>The first thing you need to do to enhance your security is determine what parts of your network are most at risk. Where are you vulnerable to hacker attacks? Hackers, like most criminals, are looking for easy targets, searching for common mistakes that lead to network vulnerability.</p>

<p>One mistake many businesses make is assuming that if each of their computer stations is equipped with antivirus software, their networks are safe. The problem with this approach is that if hackers can access your individual workstations, they are already inside your system. Keep them out by protecting your network ports.</p>

<p>Another common mistake made by small businesses is outfitting their office PCs with security software but neglecting the laptops their employees use to access the network remotely. Hackers can easily determine when a work-from-home employee is signing into the network with an improperly safeguarded computer.</p>

<h2>Plugging Network Security Gaps</h2>

<p>Creating a first line of defense against data breaches requires a comprehensive security platform. This means that all server ports and every computer in your network must be equipped with updated firewalls, hacker- detection-and-prevention software, and other security components.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Router Firewalls</em></strong></p>

<p>The data ports through which your network flows should be protected with router firewalls. Hackers can detect open ports and exploit these security gaps. You can scan your system for open ports and close them as needed. Your firewall should also be password-protected. For the most secure system, create your own password and dont rely on the default passwords that came with your router.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>VLAN Segmentation</em></strong></p>

<p>Not all of your business assets need the same level of protection. Customer and financial data needs to be defended at the highest level, whereas basic company information on your website should be freely available to your customers.</p>

<p>VLAN (virtual local area network) segmentation allows you to divide your network into sections, depending on the amount of security it requires. Access to highly critical data can be restricted while public channels are kept open.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Intrusion Prevention System</em></strong></p>

<p>An IPS (intrusion prevention system) monitors the flow of data through your network and looks for signs that something is amiss. By noting unusual activity in the network, the IPS can alert you to the activities of hackers, letting you shut them down before they do any serious damage.
<strong>
<em>
</em></strong></p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Virtual Private Networks</em></strong></p>

<p>VPNs (virtual private networks) are another tool businesses use to keep their networks safe. VPNs work by providing your remote computers with the same security measures used in the office. Offsite employees sign into the network through encrypted tunnels, which are password- protected.</p>

<h2>Employee Compliance Risks</h2>

<p>Data breaches arent always the fault of your network infrastructure. In fact, many well-protected networks are hacked each year. Some breaches are the result of unsafe computing activities by your employees.</p>

<p>A few of these employees may be unscrupulous insiders who aid hackers in their crimes. Most, however, are well-meaning and hard-working team members who lead hackers to your critical data through carelessness or a lack of knowledge about security practices.</p>

<h2>Closing Compliance Gaps</h2>

<p>To make sure your employees arent undermining your network security, you must take control of your data. This means knowing where your company data is at all times, and then regulating the flow of that information through your network.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Locating Data</em></strong></p>

<p>Two consequences of advances in communication technology are that huge amounts of data are being produced, even in small businesses, and this data is constantly being moved from place to place. The result is that companies often arent sure what information is where. This can lead to data being held in unsecured locations.</p>

<p>The first step in increasing security is to conduct a thorough inventory of your data holdings, scanning each office and remote computer in your network for sensitive information.</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>Controlling Data Flow</em></strong></p>

<p>Once your data is accounted for, you must make sure it stays where it is supposed to, and this means enforcing data-flow procedures among your employees.</p>

<p>One method hackers use to gain access to company data is through unsecured email clients. By nature, most email is less secure than your internal network and is thus open to attack. Emphasize to your employees that critical data, including passwords, should not be sent through email. Your company can use scanners to detect the unauthorized emailing of data, whether by well-meaning or unscrupulous employees.</p>

<p>Critical data should never be transported by means of removable devices like thumb drives. When thumb drives are uploaded to another computer, they can be detected and exploited by hackers. Data should always be moved through authorized, encrypted network channels.</p>

<p>This may mean restricting data access solely to the employees who require it. All too often, data is put into the hands of employees who have no use for it, substantially increasing your risk.</p>

<h2>Data Breaches Can Be Stopped</h2>

<p>Although data breaches have many causes, you can take control of your network security by implementing a comprehensive security platform. Protect each level of your system, and outfit each PC with the latest security protocols. Protect your business further by educating your employees about both best practices and risks.</p>

<p>Closing the gaps that hackers exploit is your key to a safe and reliable business network.</p>

<p>Its quiet and unassuming, but this machine may well be the most environmentally unfriendly item in your office.</p></blockquote>

<p>Right now, its probably nearby, ready to serve you. Yet this common piece of office equipment can be an environmental villain by gulping down electricity and spitting out waste.</p>

<p>What is it? Your printer.</p>

<p>Although theyre often essential for everyday tasks, printers are usually far from eco-friendly. They tend to consume more power than people realize, since some printers dont have power down settings, and most are left on during nights and weekends. This causes them to draw power even when theyre not being used.</p>

<p>And, using them creates more paper and that, in turn, can lead to waste. You dont have to toss the printer to get green, though. Try these tips instead:</p>

<li>Limit color printing, since that uses more ink.</li>

<li>Use a printer that does double-sided copying to save on paper.</li>

<li>Print in draft mode to cut down on ink usage.</li>

<li>Recycle ink and toner cartridges.</li>

<li>Put the printer on a power strip, so you can turn it off quickly on your way out the door.</li>

<li>Buy a printer thats earned the Energy Star rating.</li>

<p>Ready to save some time and money? This little-known trick can boost your green efforts without cost or effort.</p></blockquote>

<p>Its time for your green checkup.</p>

<p>Theres a wealth of information across the Web (and were happy to provide plenty ourselves) about ways to go green by replacing lighting, buying more energy-efficient computers and reducing power usage. But how can you find out if all those strategies are actually working?</p>

<p>Thats where an energy audit comes in.</p>

<p>Many business owners skip doing these audits because they think scheduling might be a hassle, or that an energy company will try to sell them expensive upgrades to their equipment.</p>

<p>However, your local utility provider wants to see your consumption lowered just as much as you do, and theyre offering free help so you can make better use of your resources. Also, these specialists can recommend money-saving rebates that can offset any investment in new equipment.</p>

<p>Expert assistance and advice at no charge? Thats tough to resist. Call your local utility company and set up an energy audit, to start working toward a greener future for your business.</p>

<p>Green computing is great for the environment, and it can also be a huge boon for your business. Among the benefits: saving resources and extending the life of your technology.</p></blockquote>

<p>Feeling green yet? Companies of all sizes and in all industries are undertaking environmentally friendly initiatives. Huge tech firms are clearing space for employee vegetable gardens, while massive data centers are drawing power from wind farms and solar panels.</p>

<p>But you dont have to think big like that to be green. Even smaller changes can make a major difference, like implementing better power management strategies or committing to a paperless office.</p>

<h2>Green Advantages</h2>

<p>In addition to protecting the environment, youll be greening up your bottom line. These types of strategies have numerous benefits, including:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Extend the life of your technology:</strong> Energy-efficient computers and peripherals are designed to last longer and be more eco-friendly. Thats good news for you, because you wont have to update your technology as often as you may have in the past.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Lessen utility costs:</strong> Many green measures focus on power consumption, since reducing energy use is such a vital part of an environmental strategy. Using power strips, turning off computers at night and taking advantage of natural lighting can all have a significant impact on your monthly power bill  and that means more money in your pocket.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Improve recruiting and retention:</strong> In a recent poll by job search website TheLadders, nearly 90 percent of respondents said working in an environmentally friendly company was important to them. Seventy-two percent added that theyd choose a job at an eco-friendly company over another that didnt implement green programs. In other words, going green can make your company more attractive to top candidates and help you retain key employees, lowering the costs of turnover.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Boost your reputation:</strong> Numerous studies have highlighted the green glow that eco-friendly strategies give companies. Customers appreciate efforts like these, which not only boosts loyalty but also increases referrals. So, in addition to being kinder to the planet, youre  being smarter in how you build your brand and customer base.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>With so many ways to implement more eco-friendly strategies, it might be tough to know where to start. But remember: any first step is a great one. Check out our article,

<li>
<strong>USB AC adapter:</strong> turn any outlet into a USB charger.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>USB Pocket Hard Drive:</strong> for easily transferring files from your notebook to other computers.</p>

<p>The small-business road warrior stays productive in and out of the office. Learn the tricks veteran business travelers use to travel light without sacrificing work cycles. Follow these tips and youll be a road warrior in no time.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many small-business owners find themselves working from airport departure lobbies as often as they work at the home office. If this describes you, or if youre gearing up for a one-time business trip, our experts can help you travel like a true small-business road warrior.</p>

<h2>Laptop, Notebook, or Tablet?</h2>

<p>Gone are the days when road warriors lugged 17-inch laptops through airport security checkpoints. Replace that 6-lb. monster with a smaller notebook that only weighs 4 lbs. and fits easily on an airplane food tray (
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Ultrabooks-PCs-Laptops-Tablets/cat_CL166724">ultrabooks</a> are a good start).</p>

<p>You can lighten the load even further by switching to a 1.5-lb. tablet that also doubles as an 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/E-Readers-E-Readers-Accessories/cat_CL164364">ereader</a>, removing the need to travel with both a laptop and Kindle. A tablets recharging cord has the extra benefit of being lighter and easier to pack than a notebook power cord.</p>

<h2>Doodads and Gadgets</h2>

<p>Any road warrior worth the name has a list of gadgets to increase business productivity. Multipurpose gadgets such as pocket projectors that double as camcorders and digital cameras are special favorites, as such devices cut down on packing. Other popular choices include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Business-card readers</li>

<li>Combination wall socket/car charger to keep devices powered</li>

<li>Mini power strips to maximize hotel wall sockets</li>

<li>Portable wireless speakers for presentations</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/USB-Cables-Power-Cables-Adapters-Chargers/cat_CL140709">Retractable USB cables</a>, for easy packing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bagging it All Up</h2>

<p>A skilled road warrior doesnt skimp on a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Laptop-Bags-Luggage-PCs-Drives-Accessories/cat_CG20">travel bag</a>. The right bag is made of durable, lightweight material and contains plenty of pockets and dividers for easy organization.</p>

<p>Shop for a travel bag with Transport Security Administration guidelines in mind. Youll want a bag that is checkpoint permissible, or your entire road warrior kit could wind up travelling in the cargo hold.</p>

<p>If a bags shoulder strap makes carrying it uncomfortable, you can buy ergonomic replacement shoulder straps online. Travel produces enough stress without adding a sore shoulder to the equation.</p>

<p>Power cords and device chargers can get overlooked in the flurry of packing that precedes a business trip. To prevent this, buy a second set of chargers that lives in your travel bag. That way, theyre all packed and ready for you.</p>

<h2>Road Trip Survival Tips</h2>

<p>Before you depart, make sure you charge every device you take with you so you can get the maximum use out of your electronics. Some road warriors keep packing and pre-travel checklists on their smartphones for easy access.</p>

<p>Prepacking duplicate chargers has already been mentioned. If you travel regularly, consider prepacking other essentials; toiletries, underwear, socks, and stationery can all be packed in advance.</p>

<p>Business travel often means transporting sensitive corporate information. Instead of transporting such information on easily stolen notebooks, phones, or USB flash drives, you can store files in the cloud through services such as Dropboxthus keeping transported data to a minimum.</p>

<p>Finally, consider purchasing a prepaid phone card for landline use. Hotels charge exorbitant rates for phone use; you cant always rely on cell phone service and cellphones are a popular target for thieves. A prepaid card saves you money if you ever have to contact the home office in an emergency.</p>

<p>Follow these tips before you head out to the open road, and youll be able to conduct business from anywhere.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>The greatest threat to students technology walks on two legs and uses that technology on a daily basis. No greater threat exists  not malware, not viruses, not hackers or thieves. Were talking, of course, about the students themselves.</p>

<h2>I Only Left It for a Minute. . .</h2>

<p>With most students carrying at least one electronic device and many carrying three or four, its hardly surprising that laptop and cell-phone theft are common problems on campuses. In spite of these, students still leave their laptops just for a minute to retrieve books, order another coffee or chat with friends, only to return to discover their laptop ran off with someone else.</p>

<p>Sadly, small electronic devices are easy to steal and easy to conceal, so keep your laptop, cell phone, and other devices in sight at all times. In the event of a theft, there are remote wipe applications available today that can allow victims to access their devices, wherever they are, and delete all the data as a last-ditch effort to destroy sensitive materials. Alternatively, many mobile phone makers today install find my phone services that can be accessed from a PC, and use GPS to determine the location of their stolen device, should it still be powered on.</p>

<h2>Wanton Wireless Activity</h2>

<p>Your college computer network has a team of IT experts working night and day to ensure that the network remains secure and private. The local coffee shops free Wi-Fi doesnt have that luxury.</p>

<p>Assume that free 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/ask-anything-videos/wireless-security-made-easy.html">Wi-Fi is unsecure</a>d, if not actually compromised, and dont log in to any site or service from these free Wi-Fi locations. Hackers can eavesdrop on information packets sent across Wi-Fi networks, allowing them to gather personal information, usernames and passwords.</p>

<h2>Password Problems</h2>

<p>Speaking of passwords, how secure are your password habits? If, like so many people, you reuse the same password for multiple sites, youre just asking for trouble. If you log in to Facebook on, say, that free Wi-Fi network in the coffee shop, and a hacker intercepts your information, you can bet hes going to try that username and password on as many different sites as possible, hoping to get a positive hit. And whatever you do, stay away from 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-most-unsafe-password-choices-of-2011.html">the worst password of all time</a>  password1  which is still the most popular password used today.</p>

<h2>Ill Update Tomorrow</h2>

<p>Your college IT department insists that students must update antivirus programs and operating systems on a regular basis. They do this for a reason: out-of-date programs have security flaws that allow malware to sneak onto the device, and by extension, into the rest of the network.</p>

<p>Small business success often depends on making the most of your time, whether its getting that major project in, or trying to spare enough time to relax and recharge after a marathon marketing session. Here are five apps that can help you squeeze every last minute out of your day.</p>

<h2>Anytime Organizer</h2>

<p>The 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Any-Time-Organizer-Deluxe-Version-14-Boxed-CD/product_369334">Any Time Organizer Deluxe</a> time-management app includes 2,500 templates for calendars and to-do lists. You can program sticky-note reminders to pop up on your desktop, audio alarms that play your favorite songs, and text reminders that the program sends to your phone.</p>

<h2>Dragon Naturally Speaking</h2>

<p>If youre a two-fingered typist, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Dragon-NaturallySpeaking-11-Premium/product_898160">Dragon Naturally Speaking</a> allows you to dictate your papers through a microphone instead of tapping them out on a keyboard. The program is wonderfully accurate, and works with almost all Windows-based applications.</p>

<h2>Evernote</h2>

<p>
<strong></strong>A free app compatible with Windows, Mac and cell phones, Evernote allows users to capture images, web clips and audio that can sync across multiple devices for quick, easy sharing.</p>

<h2>Mind42</h2>

<p>Another free app, Mind42 is a mind-mapping tool that allows users to organize tasks, showing where and when tasks need attention.</p>

<h2>RescueTime</h2>

<p>
<strong></strong>If you spend time on Facebook or playing World of Warcraft, beware! RescueTime can be a rude awakening. The app runs in the background and analyzes how much time you spend on your computer every day.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>The first few days of college overwhelm many students. Youve got to move into your dorm, buy textbooks, find out where your classes are, and decide on living guidelines with your new roommate. Chances are also good that youll be buying and setting up new computer equipment at the same time. To make those first few days a little less hectic, here are some guidelines to help you decide what hardware, software and peripherals youll need.</p>

<h2>Hardware Considerations</h2>

<p>If youre buying new hardware for college, you have to choose between 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/All-Laptop-Computers/cat_CL167289">laptops</a> and desktops. Desktops are generally cheaper, and offer more hard- drive space and RAM compared to an equivalently priced laptop. Desktops lack portability, however, and are more difficult to transport at the end of the college year when you vacate your dorm room.</p>

<p>Students generally prefer laptops to desktops, if only because of the laptops inherent portability. A laptops as useful in a lecture room, library or coffee shop as it is in your dorm room, giving it a distinct edge over a cumbersome desktop rig. On the downside, laptops are popular targets for theft on college campuses, so if you opt for a laptop, keep it close and install some antitheft software.</p>

<p>Tablets offer a third option for students, although touch-screen keyboards limit their usefulness for writing papers. You can buy a peripheral keyboard and mouse, but that adds two more items to carry around and possibly misplace. Microsofts new tablet, Surface, includes a built-in keyboard, which may change how useful tablets are as college hardware.</p>

<p>No matter what hardware you choose, make sure that it has the power and memory youll need for your area of study. A graphic-arts student will need more RAM, hard-drive storage space and a more powerful graphics card than most liberal-arts students, for example.</p>

<h2>Software Suggestions</h2>

<p>Microsoft Office or a similar productivity suite is essential for college life. If youre using a less-than-recent productivity suite, check with your colleges IT department to see if your version is compatible with college standards. The IT department also requires all student computers to have up-to-date antivirus programs.</p>

<p>Many colleges offer free, open-source word processing, antivirus programs, and other software through their IT departments. Its a good idea to check whats offered. Furthermore, some software companies offer discounts and savings to students. Adobe, for instance, offers 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Adobe-Photoshop-Elements-10/product_368256">Adobe Photoshop</a> to students at a significantly reduced price, as well as an Adobe subscription that allows you to purchase only the months when youll need the software.</p>

<h2>Peripheral Possibilities</h2>

<p>Once youve got your hardware and software sorted out, youll probably want to look at peripherals. A small printer for your dorm room makes life much easier, and saves you money on printing services. If the college uses a wired network, you can connect all your hardware to the network with a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Wireless-Routers-Computer-Accessories/cat_CL165748">wireless router</a> (check if your IT department allows this: some colleges frown on wireless dorm connections).</p>

<p>In addition, a good 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Speakers-Microphones-Headsets-Mice-Keyboards-Speakers/cat_DP1434">headset</a> allows you to block dorm noise while you study, and allows you to chat with your folks online (presuming you taught Dad how to Skype). If your use your laptop for entertainment as well as studying, a set of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Speakers-Microphones-Headsets-Mice-Keyboards-Speakers/cat_DP1434">desktop speakers</a> will improve your audio quality. While you can buy peripherals at the college bookstore, buying them online ahead of time reduces the amount of shopping you need to do when college starts.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Todays technology offers students the ability to study at the local coffee house and 24-hour access to the colleges computer network. Colleges expect students to use their networks responsibly. Failure to do so can result in network bans and security breaches.</p>

<h2>Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu</h2>

<p>Lets start with the good news. Chances are that your colleges network speed is much faster and more reliable than your home Internet connection. If youre used to YouTube videos freezing every few seconds, rejoice! Your college network will seem like heaven. Whether you like to stream videos or play online games, youll probably notice a real improvement in download rates, video quality and lag times. In return for that speed, however, the college assumes youll abide by some restrictions.
<strong>
</strong></p>

<p>Most colleges take a dim view of peer-to-peer (P2P) software like BitTorrent and the like. The use of such software raises all sorts of thorny copyright issues, and many of the files shared on such sites are loaded with malware. Chances are good that your college prohibits the use of these file-sharing software applications, and forbids open shares (meaning, essentially, allowing your computer to be accessed randomly by the P2P network without active approval on your part) on computers connected to the network. Shared folders need to be password-protected.</p>

<p>In other words, youve got access to amazing bandwidth, but dont try to use it to download pirated copies of every movie ever made. College IT does track bandwidth use, and such behavior can get you banned from the network.</p>

<h2>Public Wi-Fi and Coffee-Shop Studying</h2>

<p>Dorm life can get loud, often when youre trying to finish a major assignment. Or perhaps you just need a change of scenery to get those paper-writing synapses firing. At such times, you might decide to spend the evening at the local coffee shop. After all, a cafés got two things students crave: caffeine and free Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>Public Wi-Fi is vulnerable to 
<a title="Modern malware Threat" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/the-modern-malware-threat-2/" target="_blank">malware</a>, key-logging viruses and other tools hackers use to compromise computer security. Public Wi-Fi in or around a college is especially attractive to hackers, as large numbers of people use such systems.</p>

<p>Exercise some caution when connecting to public Wi-Fi systems. Dont log into any website that requires usernames or passwords, whether its the college email system, your online bank or your Facebook account, because you dont know if someone is listening in on you.</p>

<h2>Malware and Security Breaches</h2>

<p>College networks offer some of the juiciest targets to hackers outside of big business, government agencies and military systems. A hacker, once in a college system, can access thousands of peoples personal information. Understandably, college IT departments do everything possible to prevent such breaches.</p>

<p>As a student on the network, youll be expected to keep your operating system and 
<a title="Antivirus Programs" href="http://www.staples.com/Computer-Software-Accounting-Forms-Security/StaplesCategoryDisplay?catalogIdentifier=2&amp;amp;languageId=-1&amp;amp;identifier=CG5&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;redirectrule=CL140492&amp;amp;redirecttype=auto" target="_blank">antivirus programs</a> current with the latest security patches and updates. Frankly, this is a good habit to get into, anyway. You can set both your operating system and antivirus program to check for and install updates automatically, usually in the Preferences or Setting menu found within those applications.</p>

<p>Be aware that online con artists consider students to be easy prey. Many students are young, and may not have the experience needed to spot the signs of phishing scams (phishing is when a hacker attempts to get email passwords or addresses from a user by way of emails or random instant messages, usually posing as a friend or family member). Students also have a reputation for being strapped for cash, which makes them a target for email scams (promising a cash windfall from Nigeria, for example). You can expect to receive a fair amount of spam and scam email through your college email account. Such email may also include malware attachments. Never open an email attachment unless you know where it came from.</p>

<h2>Know Whats Allowed</h2>

<p>Reading a Terms and Conditions document in its entirety is a good remedy for insomnia, but students should at least read up on acceptable and unacceptable uses for their colleges network. For instance, most colleges forbid use of the network for commercial practices like running a for-profit business, and many prohibit unauthorized use of wireless equipment.</p>

<p>In almost all cases, use of any hardware and software that compromise network security or user privacy is strictly forbidden. Knowing what you can and cannot do helps you use the network effectively without treading on sensitive IT toes.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>A laptop or computer setup provides a solid foundation for the modern students tech needs, but what about peripherals and accessories? In the flurry of activity before college starts, you may not have time to consider which computer extras will help you through the school year. Here at Staples weve identified nine essential computer accessories for the college-bound student.</p>

<h2>Remote Keyboards and Mouse Pointers</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Corded-Keyboards-Keyboards/cat_CL141981">Wireless keyboards</a> and mice allow you to turn any flat surface into a desk. When youre strapped for cash (and what college student isnt?) it may be tempting to make do with your laptops built-in keyboard and tracking pad. Wireless keyboards (our techs especially love the Logitech 750 and 760 solar-powered mice) offer better ergonomics, however, reducing your risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. And tracking pads dont offer the convenience of a good 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Mice-Mice-Keyboards-Speakers/cat_DP1925">mouse</a>.</p>

<h2>Small Printers</h2>

<p>Professors increasingly accept assignments by email, but some still prefer paper. While your college probably offers printing services, such services arent always free or available 24/7. A small 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Wireless-Printers-Mac-Computer-Accessories/cat_CL164737">wireless printer</a> fits neatly onto a dorm bookcase and quickly pays for itself.</p>

<h2>Cooling Desks</h2>

<p>If youre a laptop user, a fan-powered USB 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Laptop-Cooling-Computer-Accessories/cat_CL142670">cooling desk</a> is a wise investment. A cooling desk allows you to work with a notebook on your lap without frying your thighs or overheating the machine.</p>

<h2>Webcams</h2>

<p>Webcams may not help much with your studies, but theyre handy for staying in touch with family and friends back home. Point out the advantages of Skype to your parents and they might spring for a webcam just so they can see you. Just make sure you and your folks establish some communication rules before you leave for college, or Mom could be Skyping at inconvenient moments.</p>

<h2>Laptop Locks</h2>

<p>If youre studying in a public place, you might not want to pack up your laptop every time you get up to buy a coffee. Leaving your laptop unattended in public is just asking for trouble, however. A 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Laptop-Locks-Lights-Computer-Accessories/cat_CL141483">portable laptop lock</a> secures your laptop to desks or tables with a galvanized steel cable and combination lock.</p>

<h2>Storage Devices</h2>

<p>Imagine working day and night on a major assignment for a college course. Now imagine your laptop hard drive dying, destroying all traces of the assignment a day before the due date.</p>

<p>Backing up data is essential for college students. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/External-Hard-Drives/cat_DP4755">External hard drives</a> are inexpensive, and their small size makes them easy to store in a cramped dorm room. Many students choose to back up data to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Network-Attached-Storage-Hard-Drives-USB-Drives-DVD-Burners/cat_CL164718">cloud storage services</a>, provided by either the college or independent companies.</p>

<p>Dont overlook the importance of a USB thumb drive with a few gigabytes of memory. While too easily misplaced to act as a backup device, a thumb drive is handy for those inevitable times when you need to transfer files between classroom computers and your laptop.</p>

<h2>Extra Laptop Batteries</h2>

<p>Like remote keyboards and mice, an extra laptop battery can seem like an unnecessary expense when youre counting pennies for coffee money. After all, you already have a battery and you can recharge it just by plugging in, but do you know how difficult it is to find an available outlet at a coffee shop? Competition for outlets is even more intense in a college auditorium or library study hall. An extra battery keeps you going, no matter where you are. When youre searching for one to buy, make sure it promises 610 hours of battery life. (Master your mobile devices battery life with these 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/five-ways-to-make-your-laptop-battery-last-longer.html">"5 Tips for Better Battery Life Management"</a>).</p>

<p>Besides, come springtime you might want to get out of the dorm to study under that big ol tree in the quad. Lovely though they are, shade trees lack electric outlets.</p>

<h2>Laptop Bags</h2>

<p>Its not exactly a computer peripheral, but no college student should be without a sturdy and comfortable laptop bag. Youll carry your laptop from class to class on a regular basis, so choose a bag thats lightweight and ergonomic. A good laptop bag also has enough space for textbooks and other essentials.</p>

<p>With these nine must-have accessories, youll be ready for anything your professors can dish out. Except maybe noisy dorm mates, but even then, there are some excellent 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Headphones-iPod-Accessories/cat_CL162357">noise-canceling options available.</a></p>

<title>Communication Technology Tips for Parents</title>
<description>When your kids in college, its tempting to take advantage of technology to stay in contact 24/7. Just remember, your kids likely enjoying her newfound independence, and may not want a constant stream of news from home.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>College is a time for personal growth, academic learning and new experiences for students. For parents, its a time of constant worry. Your childs away from home for the first time. Youre worried about how shell adapt to life on their own, whether her roommate is a good influence, who shes dating and, of course, how well her studies progress. Its not exactly a fair trade: the kids get a chance to develop into adults, while parents only get gray hairs and tuition bills.</p>

<p>Now add electronic communication to the mix. Back in the distant past, when dinosaurs roamed the earth and this generation of parents went to college, parent-student communication was primarily based on an ancient artifact called the landline telephone. Communication was generally restricted to a weekly call on this archaic device.</p>

<p>Ah, but look at today. Emails, cell phones, texting, instant messaging and Skype video calls are all instantly available. Found a good deal on eggs at the grocery store? Text that exciting info to your student. Received another inspirational words to live by email from Aunty Beth? Forward it to your son. Saw a baby playing with a kitten? Take a snapshot with your cell phone camera and send that adorableness to your student! Log onto Facebook and see your child is online? Hop onto Skype to tell her that grandma will be out for Thanksgiving after all.</p>

<p>Whats wrong with this picture? Well, if your child wants all that communication, absolutely nothing. Its more than likely, however, that your student doesnt appreciate being constantly deluged with texts, emails and requests for Skype calls.</p>

<p>College is a time when kids mature into adults, and that maturing requires a certain distance from parents. If your student doesnt immediately respond to that baby-and-kitten image you sent, it doesnt mean she no longer loves you. It might, however, mean shes socializing, watching a movie or even (gasp!) studying.</p>

<h2>Schedule Communication</h2>

<p>The best way to handle communication with a college student is to sit down before college even starts and simply ask the student how much communication shes comfortable with. Does she want to Skype once a week, or would she rather play an online game of Words with Friends and instant message every couple of days? Explain that you want regular communication, but that you dont want to be too clingy either. Chances are, shell appreciate it.</p>

<h2>Let the Student Control Communication</h2>

<p>While many kids will say theyre cool with once-a-week phone calls or Skype sessions, todays teens have grown up with constant access to communication through cell phones, Facebook and texts. Your student may decide to contact you more than once a week, even if its just a brief cell phone call during class changes. Relish these opportunities, but let the student initiate them.</p>

<p>If you do call outside of your regular schedule, make sure that its for something important. A good deal on eggs isnt a good enough reason to call, but grandma being able to make it to Thanksgiving Dinner in spite of her hip? Thats good news, and worth sending an email or making a phone call.</p>

<p>Remember this as well: some methods of online communication are less invasive than others. Facebook updates are an easy way to stay in contact without distracting students from study or social life  just dont expect immediate responses to posts.</p>

<title>Get To Know Your College IT Department</title>
<description>A College IT department offers support and advice to students using the institutions computer network. Understanding what your IT department can and cannot do for students makes setting up your college computer much easier.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>Not every college student majors in computer science or is lucky enough to have a roommate who does. Students with less-than-stellar computer skills may find connecting laptops to the college network one of the most challenging tasks of their academic career. For those who arent studying to be the next Jobs or Gates, the college IT department is a valuable tech resource.</p>

<h2>What the IT Department Does</h2>

<p>Your college IT department is responsible for the care and upkeep of the college computer network, including security and privacy issues. The IT department provides support to students registering email accounts, helps them get set up on the college computer system and assists with services such as data backup (if the college network offers such services).</p>

<p>Most college IT department websites include FAQs, instructions on how to check grades online and network access details. Many have virtual helpdesks where users can submit requests for assistance. The IT department also offers resources such as articles on patching operating systems, installing antivirus programs and similar computer issues.</p>

<p>If youre looking for computer lab locations and hours of operation, the IT department is the place to start your search. If you have complaints about the network or concerns about the security of information stored on the network, again, ask the IT staff. (Helpful hint: Be polite. IT staff tend to be busy people who get more than their fair share of abuse from upset students and staff. Be nice to them and theyll be nice to you).</p>

<p>The IT department also provides and enforces acceptable use policies detailing how the network can or cannot be used, including activities that violate the Student Code of Ethics.</p>

<p>Its important to read these policies, as certain types of hardware or software may be prohibited. IT policies also ban any computer activities that threaten the networks security or user privacy. Failure to abide by these policies can get students blocked from the network, and possibly face college disciplinary charges.</p>

<h2>What the IT Department Doesnt Do</h2>

<p>College IT departments are busy places, and consider some issues to be the students responsibility. For instance, its your responsibility to ensure your operating system and antivirus program are up-to-date. If you dont have an antivirus program, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/get-help-now/">Staples expert technicians can help</a>, or check with your IT department. They may recommend a product, and some even offer free antiviral software.</p>

<p>Its also your responsibility to ensure that your computer is capable of connecting to the network. In other words, the IT department will help you connect to the network, but will not provide Ethernet cables or 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=modems&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home">modems</a>.</p>

<p>While the IT department provides computer network support to students and staff, it does not provide tech support for hardware or software issues on personal computers. If a lab computer has a hardware problem, the IT department will fix that. If a students personal laptop has the same issue, IT staff wont deal with the problem. Fortunately, students can access a wide range of technical help from other sources, including Staples in-store services, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/view-all-services/">online services </a>and, yes, possibly even a dorm mate who is studying computer science.</p>

<title>Day One: A College Dorm Setup Guide</title>
<description>Settling into dorm life is part of the college experience. Registering with the college computer network is a priority for most students, who need their electronics for study and recreation.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>It's your first day in a college dorm. Your parents have left. Dad cried. You have bags of supplies piled up in a corner. The previous residents left the kind of mess only a bleach-spraying flamethrower can fix, and even though you know your roommates pretty well already through Facebook, you still arent sure if theyre truly human.</p>

<p>None of that has priority, though. You want to get your tech online, whether you brought it with you or just picked up shiny new goodies at the campus computer store. How do you get started?</p>

<h2>Step One: Read Your Dorm Room Information Package</h2>

<p>You probably received a dorm room information package when you moved in. It might be buried under that pile of new books, school supplies and other goodies  dig it out now, because youre going to need it.</p>

<p>Somewhere in that welcome package, youll find instructions for connecting your laptop or computer to the colleges computer network. Each college system is slightly different, but in almost all cases, you must register to access the system. Registration may require using a computer already connected to the system, such as one at the library or a dorm residents already-connected system. Youll need at least some of the following information:</p>

<ul>

<li>Your assigned college email address or username</li>

<li>Your dorm buildings name and your room number</li>

<li>The physical address of your computer</li>

<li>Your computers serial number, usually found on the back or bottom</li>

<li>Your dorms Ethernet port number (if applicable).</li>
</ul>

<p>Your network or physical address is available through your computer. Different operating systems have different methods of retrieving the IP address. Find out how to retrieve this information from your computer before moving into the dorm, and youll save yourself some time. This type of information is typically found in the Network settings menu within the Control Panel (Windows) or System Preferences menu (Mac).</p>

<p>Once you fill out the online registration form, you may have to wait up to 24 hours before you can access the network.</p>

<h2>Wired or Wireless?</h2>

<p>Some colleges offer wireless connectivity, while others favor wired systems for greater security. If you have multiple devices and the dorm only provides an Ethernet jack, a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=wireless+router&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home&amp;amp;autocompletesearchkey=wireless+router">wireless router</a> will be a huge help. Check with your college IT department before installing a router, however  some colleges have restrictions on what equipment can connect to their network, and specific router settings may be required. Others ban wireless local area networks (LAN) (definition of LAN) outright, so before you splurge on high-priced, complex gear, be sure you know the campus tech services ground rules and 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/ask-anything-videos/wireless-security-made-easy.html">set up your wireless security immediately</a>.</p>

<h2>Come Prepared</h2>

<p>Unless you feel you cannot live without a CPU*, laptops are generally preferable in dorm rooms. Laptops are smaller, more portable and can connect to docking stations when you need to work at a desk. Besides, at the end of the school year, youll have to pack up everything and move out, and laptops take up much less space than a CPU or monitor.</p>

<p>
<em>* Design, film, architecture and engineering students: Think twice before jumping at a laptop  larger screens and more computing power may be what you need (dont even go into those who plan to game on the family $$).</em></p>

<p>Pick yourself up an 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=ethernet+cables&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home">Ethernet cable</a> before moving into the dorm. Youll need to plug one into the Ethernet jack if the dorm uses a wired network, and a cable will at least let you get your laptop online until you can pick up a router. Ethernet cables can also come in handy at the campus library or academic halls that might not have the same wireless connectivity youre used to at home.</p>

<p>The first few days of college life are a mix of excitement, nervousness and activity. Follow the colleges rules for setting up your network carefully, and remember that the IT department offers student assistance. The sooner you can get online, the sooner you can Skype home, play a few games for stress relief or kick back with a movie after classes. Oh yeah, and you might want to use your tech for studying as well</p>

<p>Midterms, grades, term papers and finals  school is filled with challenges that can make even the most organized student lose sleep.</p>

<p>But creating more efficiency in your schedule and choosing apps that streamline your work can boost success  and even prevent an all-nighter. Here are some popular apps to make the most of your school time, so theres plenty of time for play, too.</p>

<h2>Evernote</h2>

<p>Forget the piles of paper notebooks that can get lost or trashed. 
<a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> gathers information in a way thats accessible and searchable from anywhere, and lets you throw in any kind of data. You can capture notes from class, Web pages mentioned by a professor, photos of your goofy friends, audio notes to yourself or just about anything that can be downloaded.</p>

<p>This app also allows you to organize the information and then do keyword searches. You can even find text thats stored in handwritten form  try doing that with a notebook filled during a Monday morning class.</p>

<h2>Memonic</h2>

<p>Another great, affordable way to organize, 
<a href="http://www.memonic.com">Memonic</a> keeps notes arranged in a clutter-free Web interface. You can edit notes right from the Web browser, use keyboard shortcuts to be even speedier and customize the look with different backgrounds (easy on the eyes means easier to use, right?).</p>

<p>The Web clipper feature stands out as a way to save Web pages for later reading, without having to bulk up your browsers bookmarks folder. You can even forward emails and attachments to your collection. Think of it as a personal assistant that does everything but your laundry  and if you find an app for that, let us know.</p>

<h2>Google</h2>

<p>Many students love to tap into Google apps for organizing class schedules and keeping track of assignment due dates. 
<a href="http://google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> can issue reminders and present information in a simple interface. If a professor uses the app as well, you can usually view that calendar along with yours. For sharing work among students, sending a draft to the professor or creating a spreadsheet, 
<a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> makes it all easy.</p>

<h2>Dropbox</h2>

<p>Part of staying organized is centralizing all your stuff. 
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> lets you keep your files, end-of-semester reports and essays in one place, and you can access it from any device or computer as long as you have an Internet connection.</p>

<p>For those who have to share computers or fret about losing their data, this app is a great way to store data without having to pay for portable drives or cloud services. Its even got student roots: one of the company founders came up with the idea after repeatedly forgetting his USB flash drive during college.</p>

<h2>Plants vs. Zombies</h2>

<p>No one can study 24/7. So why not fight zombies in your free time? In the quirky 
<a href="http://www.popcap.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/pc">Plants vs. Zombies</a> game, you install plants to stem a zombie attack (apparently, they hate freshly planted Zen gardens the most). Or, you can switch sides and make your own zombie instead.</p>

<p>With such a wealth of note-taking power, schedule organization and document sharing, you can tackle those college tasks with ease. Best of all, these apps are free  leaving you more money for the party fund.</p>

<p>Getting organized can take just a few clicks. With mobile apps that are geared toward student success, its easy to stay on top of assignments, find notes and schedule professor meeting times.</p>

<p>We havent found an app yet for instant pizza delivery or dealing with messy roommates, but theyre probably in development.</p>

<p>In the meantime, check out these six top mobile apps:</p>

<h2>Everstudent</h2>

<p>Lodged inside the popular free app 
<a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>, this easy-to-use app helps you manage your assignments and tasks, creating a killer planner that will keep you on track. Organize assignments by class, add color codes and input other notes like test dates, professor emails and office hours, and schedule reminders.</p>

<h2>Dictionary.com</h2>

<p>When your professor throws out a word like antithetical or disputatious (making you long for the word commencement), youve got it covered. 
<a href="http://www.dictionary.reference.com">Dictionary.com</a> lets you find definitions fast, and even works without an Internet connection once its downloaded.</p>

<p>Want to throw around a few terms yourself? An audio pronunciation guide is provided, too, along with sample sentences and word history. Go ahead, get voluble.</p>

<h2>JiWire Wi-Fi Finder</h2>

<p>Your English Lit paper is due in four hours, but youre off campus (or maybe even out of the country) for the day. But you wont be out of luck: with the handy 
<a href="http://www.jwire.com/iphone">JiWire Wi-Fi Finder</a>, you can lock onto a signal and get online quickly. The app lists nearly half a million free and paid Wi-Fi hotspots in over 144 countries. You can help out other students, too, by sharing a hotspot via email or your Twitter or Facebook accounts.</p>

<h2>Google Goggles</h2>

<p>As part of its mobile search app collection, Google includes 
<a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/goggles">this funky app</a>, which uses image-recognition technology to return relevant search results. Snap a picture of a famous landmark, and the app will let you know what youre looking at.</p>

<p>You can also scan barcodes to get product information, add contacts by taking a photo of a business card or even translate foreign language text by capturing a snippet of it in a picture. Not that youre goofing off during class, but its also excellent for solving Sudoku puzzles.</p>

<h2>Bump</h2>

<p>Sharing notes and contact info is a breeze with the simple app 
<a href="http://www.bu.mp">Bump</a>. The software lets two mobile-device users swap info simply by bumping two phones together. Its ideal for creating a study group and exchanging contact information quickly as you hustle off to your next class. As a bonus, you can also use the app to share photos with friends and family, and move contacts and photos from your device to your computer.</p>

<h2>Mint</h2>

<p>Whether youre a business student whos saving for an entrepreneurial venture, or youre cash-strapped and tired of rooting between couch cushions to find change for coffee, 
<a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint</a> will help you find your way. The financial-management app lets you put all your accounts into one place so you can set a budget and track goals. By the time your first student-loan payment rolls around, youll be way ahead of the game.</p>

<p>Mobile apps like these can be a boon for any organization, so youll spend more time studying (and playing) and less time trying to juggle school and social time. Best of all, theyre free. Better scheduling, more robust study resources and financial management? Now, thats smart.</p>

<p>Keep your network running smoothly with these quick tips for business owners.</p></blockquote>

<p>Running a small or medium-sized business can be a little like playing whack-a-mole: Youre constantly stamping out new problems. One of the most consistent sources of headaches for SBOs is the computer network specifically, what happens when everything grinds to a halt due to a slow or lost Internet connection.</p>

<p>Sure, you may have mastered the art of delegation, but what do you do if the IT guy is on vacation? Or, a far more terrifying thought: What if you dont have one?</p>

<p>In this column, we explore some easy troubleshooting tips that dont require a computer science degree.</p>

<h2>Check the Basics</h2>

<p>Lets start with the cables. Is everything plugged in? Turned on? Ethernet cables have a diabolical tendency to pull out halfway; make sure that each one is audibly clicked into place.</p>

<p>What about the LEDs on the side of your modem or router? Are you getting red lights, flashing greens, or a nice solid green? If your Internet connection is on the blinkliterallythen try resetting the router before you move on to other steps.</p>

<p>Finally, make sure all the other devices connections are active. Turn on the Wi-Fi on every laptop, tablet, and smartphone you want to connect.</p>

<h2>Ping the Network</h2>

<p>Ping is one of those terms that everybody has heard but few really understand. At its simplest, the ping is a networking status check command: one computer sends a tiny packet of data to another computers IP address. If the other computer pings back in a timely manner, the network is up and running as it should.</p>

<p>However, if that ping sails unanswered into the void, or if it returns several seconds late, you have a problem somewhere with switching or configuration. Try pinging every device in your office to ensure the local network is working fine. (For a quick series of tips on 
<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_6825029_ping-lan-network.html">how to ping a LAN</a>, check out this brief article from eHow tech.)</p>

<h2>Running Interference</h2>

<p>Sometimes a networking problem is a matter of degree rather than a simple up-or-down proposition. What if your network is running, but its running slowly? The problem could be 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/ten-essential-tips-for-wireless-network-dominance.html">wireless interference</a>.</p>

<p>Many routers use the 2.4 GHz bandwidth that is shared by other devices such as garage door openers, microwaves, and cordless phones. Move the router away from these gadgets and check for improvement. You may also want to consider changing the channel on your router between 1, 6, and 11 to eliminate interference from nearby hotspots. If all else fails, investing in a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/technology-research-centers/networking/index.html">high-gain antenna</a> could solve these problems for good.</p>

<h2>Get the Password</h2>

<p>Sadly, a great number of small-business networking problems can be attributed to incorrect passwords. One common source of confusion is that wireless networking includes not one, but three separate passwords: one for your ISP, one to get into the routers control panel, and one for devices to get on the network.</p>

<p>Check to make sure everybody has these passwords straight and that proper sign-ons are being used across the board. If youve forgotten your routers password, do a full reset and start over with something you can write down. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/easytech-debunks-the-biggest-wireless-networking-myths.html">Experts recommend a strong 10-digit password</a> of random numbers and letters.</p>

<h2>Protocols</h2>

<p>Another common source of missed connections is bad protocols, specifically setting up devices that dont use compatible wireless signals or security. Wireless networking standards have evolved from 802.11a to 802.11n, passing b and g along the way.</p>

<p>If your laptops or other devices are equipped with older networking cards, or the router is using a slower protocol than the devices, youll likely run into issues with speed and consistency. Check the options on every device on your network and confirm that each component is using the most advanced protocol possible.</p>

<p>Dont worry if you have some ns mixed in with some gs; Wi-Fi is backward compatible, so opting for speed wont shut out your legacy hardware.</p>

<h2>Which Network?</h2>

<p>Do you work in a building with other companies? Do your employees carry their own portable hotspots? Are you located in a loft space above a Starbucks? Its possible the devices on your network are connecting to wireless access points other than your own.</p>

<p>To check out the situation, go into your router settings and change its broadcast ID (SSID) to something clear and memorable. Then make sure everyone is connecting to the home networkand avoiding the siren song of that free Wi-Fi down the hall.</p>

<h2>Check the ISP</h2>

<p>Its possible that after taking all these steps, your network is still stalled. In that case, the problem may lie in the interface between you and your Internet service provider (ISP).</p>

<p>If your firewall settings are blocking access, disable them and check again. If that doesnt resolve the problem, its possible your ISP is suffering an outage. Call and check.</p>

<p>One final possibility: Your ISP is throttling your data, or slowing your connection intentionally to impose invisible bandwidth limitations. Depending on where you live, this is either illegal or massively inconvenient. Either way, its probably time for a new ISP.</p>

<h2>Network Nirvana</h2>

<p>Theres no need to suffer with constant network interruptions. If your networking know-how isnt quite great enough to handle the daily upkeep, you have two options: keep a clever young employee around to help, or get your network installed by a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/">team of professionals</a>.</p>

<p>Once everything is humming along as it should, you can put away the giant mole mallet and go back to running your business in the blissful flow of a ready data stream.</p>

<title>Call Back Later: The Small-Business Office is on Vacation</title>
<description>As a small-business owner, how do you balance a vacation and a small business? Read on for our expert advice.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>As a small-business owner, how do you balance a vacation and a small business? Read on for our expert advice.</p></blockquote>

<p>Heres a quick quiz for small-business owners (SBOs): when you hear the words two week vacation, do you experience longing, dread, or both emotions simultaneously?</p>

<p>If you answered longing, youre probably overdue for a vacation. If you immediately experienced dread, youre probably concerned that the business will collapse without you. And if you experienced both, well, youre a small- business owner.</p>

<p>An 
<a href="http://quickbase.intuit.com/blog/2012/03/26/think-you-have-worklife-balance-compare-to-others-to-find-out/">Intuit small-business survey reports</a> that over two-thirds of small-business owners experience significant stress during vacations. The idea of missing work, disappointing a client, or leaving the business in the hands of a subordinate overwhelms many small-business owners. Without breaks and vacations, however, company owners become even more stressed and less productive. Its an unnecessary pattern, because small-business owners can take vacations with a little planning.</p>

<h2>Keep Clients Informed</h2>

<p>In the age of email, Skype, and texts, business clients get frustrated when they dont receive immediate responses to their messages. You may worry that taking a break from the office will upset your important clients.</p>

<p>The solution is simpleso simple that many SBOs overlook it. Contact your clients and tell them when youll be on vacation. Give them plenty of lead-time so they can make alternate arrangements. The same client who gets grumpy if he waits longer than a day for an email response reacts much more positively if he knows youre on vacation.</p>

<h2>Clearing Your Desk</h2>

<p>Before going on vacation, make sure to finish any projects. Do this, and you can relax on the beach without the shadow of an upcoming deadline blotting out the sun.</p>

<p>Of course, this may mean working some extra hours in the weeks leading up to your vacation, but the payoff is worth the time. You get to relax on your vacation, and your clients know youre responsible and driven enough to go the extra mile to meet their needs.</p>

<h2>Out-of-Office Emails</h2>

<p>Setting up an automated out-of-office email message reminds clients that youre off sunning yourself in paradise, while also reminding them when youll be back in the office soon enough.</p>

<p>If youre concerned about missing important emails, you can check your business correspondence on vacation. Be disciplined, howeverits all too easy to log into your email for a few minutes in the morning only to discover youre still working at sunset. If you absolutely must check work email on vacation, set aside a half-hour a day to do so. Explain in your out-of-office message that you will check in at that time, and that time only.</p>

<h2>Delegating Tasks</h2>

<p>Oh no, the D word! Your small business is your brainchild. You know how it works, you know what needs doing, and you know (hopefully) how to handle any 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/ask-anything-videos/curious-intern-mucks-up-office-security.html">emergencies</a>. Giving up control of that to someone else produces a feeling not unlike giving a sixteen-year old the keys to your new carabject, all-consuming terror.</p>

<p>Your employees, however, are probably quite capable of handling your business in your absence. Designate one trusted staff member as your representative, and leave detailed lists of each employees responsibilities. Often the process is a revelation: You may discover that you could have delegated some tasks to subordinates long ago, whether youre at work or on vacation.</p>

<p>Another option is to arrange with another company owner in your field to cover for each other during vacations. This only works, of course, if you trust each other, as youre leaving your business in the hands of a competitor.</p>

<h2>Easing into a Vacation</h2>

<p>If, like many small-business owners, you dread the idea of leaving the office unattended, you may have to ease yourself into the idea. Start smalltake a Friday afternoon off on a slow workweek and enjoy a long weekend. A little later, take a Thursday and Friday off. See? Four days away from the office (counting the weekend), and the place is still standing.</p>

<p>Its silly, but easing yourself into the idea of vacations can help you prepare for one. Every time you take a mini break, prepare the office as if you were leaving for two weeks. When you get back from a mini break, evaluate how well the office reacted to your absence. Chances are youll find things went just fine. It can be a bit of an ego blow to realize that your employees can function perfectly well without you. Turn that feeling around. Its not that youre irrelevant; its that you trained them so well.</p>

<h2>Checking in or checking out?</h2>

<p>Some small-business owners feel they absolutely must check in with the office regularly during a vacation. Others are happy to keep their cell phones available in case of emergency, and still others think that work has no place at all in a vacation.</p>

<p>Whatever your views, be sure to make them clear to clients and staff before you leave for your vacation. And remember, its what works best for you: If working 30 minutes a day helps you relax for the rest of the vacation, youll probably have a more restful break than if you cut all ties with the office. If, however, you plan on dropping off the grid for two weeks, make sure everyone knows youre about to disappear.</p>

<h2>Vacation Apps</h2>

<p>Many mobile apps designed with the small-business road warrior in mind help you stay connected during your break. Skype allows you to chat with folks back at the office, while Dropbox lets you review files and employee work from anywhere on the planet. You can also use Facebook to reach out to employees or clients, if need be.</p>

<p>You can use mobile apps to work during those portions of the vacation that arent much fun, such as long waits in airport terminals. Then again, you could also pass the time playing Angry Birdsheck, its your vacation.</p>

<title>In Case of Emergency, Please Back Up Your Data</title>
<description>Extreme weather and disasters can destroy a small businesss valuable data. Learn how to keep you data safe in an emergency.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Extreme weather and disasters can destroy a small businesss valuable data. Learn how to keep you data safe in an emergency.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you know why Google and Apple set up their massive data centers in places like inland North Carolina? It's because inland North Carolina, and similar locations, have a relatively low risk of natural disasters (the cheaper real estate prices probably didnt hurt either). Both companies understand that hurricanes, earthquakes, and other disasters could cost them millions (perhaps billions) of dollars in lost revenue if those data centers are damaged.</p>

<p>Of course, Apple and Google have more money than many small nations, so they have the luxury of picking and choosing where they do business. Small- business owners usually cant just pick up and move. If you do business in San Francisco, you have to consider the possibility of earthquakes, up to and including the long-dreaded Big One. Likewise, the southeastern U.S. coastline gets hammered by hurricanes on an annual basis, while tornados make even the Central Plains risky. Come to think of it, inland North Carolina could very well be the only place left to build a massive data center on the planet (we kid, we kid!).</p>

<p>Smaller-scale disasters such as office fires, windstorms, and even sudden power surges can all destroy business equipment and data. Some researchers even express concern that a large-scale solar flare could knock out electronic equipment across the globe. Thieves, computer viruses, and hackers are an ever-present danger to sensitive information.</p>

<h2>Backups Save Businesses</h2>

<p>No matter their location, all small businesses need a disaster plan, and that plan should include backing up business data on a regular basis. How you choose to back up data is up to you: cloud storage, USB flash drives, and external hard drives are all options.</p>

<p>You have plenty of flexibility in how you back up data, but should follow two inviolate rules: regularly update your backups, and store backup data in a remote location. Regular updates limit how much data you lose in a disaster. Remote storage ensures you can access the data if disaster destroys your office. Backups stored in the office are at just as much risk as the original information.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=flash+drives&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home&amp;amp;searchViewTypeGridList=listView">USB flash drives</a>, CDs, and DVDs work well for transporting backups to remote locations, and their size makes them easy to store in security deposit boxes. On the downside, USB drives get lost with astonishing regularity. Attaching the drive to a dongle may help prevent loss.</p>

<p>External hard drives offer more storage than flash drives, and are more difficult to misplace. Transporting the hard drive back and forth between the office and its safe location is time consuming, however, and makes it tempting to procrastinate with backups.</p>

<p>If you absolutely must store backups on site, consider a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=rugged+hard+drive&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home&amp;amp;searchViewTypeGridList=listView">rugged hard drive</a>. Designed with extreme conditions in mind, these drives are crush resistant, chemical resistant, and waterproof for up to three days.</p>

<h2>Cloud Storage</h2>

<p>Your data doesnt care where you store it, whether its in the cloud or on writable CDs in a shoebox at the back of your bedroom closet. For your small businesss protection, however, chose the most secure storage option you can find. For most small businesses, that means back up to the cloud.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/carbonite-online-backup/index.html?cmSearchKeyword=data+storage">Cloud storage</a> offers inexpensive annual subscriptions and encrypted storage. Data-storage centers protect your data against fire, weather extremes, and theft.</p>

<p>Cloud storage services simplify the backup process. External storage devices require manual backups. Cloud storage services support automated, scheduled backups. Many small businesses schedule Friday evenings for automated backups, while data-heavy companies may schedule daily backups.</p>

<title>Assessing Your Small Business Technology Infrastructure</title>
<description>Is your technology ready for business? Learn how to make sure that the tech in your officeyour PCs, network, and mobile devicesis right for the job.</description>

<p>Is your technology ready for business? Learn how to make sure that the tech in your officeyour PCs, network, and mobile devicesis right for the job.</p></blockquote>

<p>Assessing your small-business technology infrastructure may sound like a daunting task, but it doesnt have to be. At the most basic level, youre simply evaluating what you have, what you need, and how to get it.</p>

<p>Hardware is the watchword herespecifically, which machines will best serve your company into the future. If youve ever wondered whether your business is built to scale, or even survive over time, here are some of the best questions to ask.</p>

<h2>How many PCs or servers do you have?</h2>

<p>If its more than four or five, you may want to consider consolidating some computing power away from each desk. Server rooms offer a nice, flexible option: Properly cooled and designed, they provide expandable processing power well into the future. For an even more versatile option, you can try remote-hosted software and servers that avoid the hassles of upgrades, maintenance, or equipment.</p>

<h2>Do you plan on expanding soon, or are you a one-person shop for good?</h2>

<p>If your business is essentially you, you may not need additional infrastructure. But if you expect to add employees and payroll in the future, then its time to think about some company-wide hardware standards.</p>

<p>Look at some reviews of enterprise operating systems, office software, and bulk licensing for the other programs you use. And if your employees will be using their own mobile devices to work, consider putting a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/do-this-now-define-your-mobile-security-policy.html">mobile computing policy</a> on paperyou never know what kids today will be packing when they arrive on Day One.</p>

<h2>What are your networking needs?</h2>

<p>Home networks work fine when youre alone in the garage, but youll need something more robust if your company expands. Take a look at some of the fatter data pipes available, from top-flight cable networks to your own dedicated T1 line. After all, the last thing your growing business needs is to drop orders because your network cant handle the bandwidth from all those transactions. Many ISPs even offer business class packages to help streamline your experience.</p>

<h2>Are you a road warrior or an office drone?</h2>

<p>Either way, youll need the right tools for the job. Mobile business requires mobile hardware, from rugged smartphones and tablets to ultralight notebooks that can run all day on a single charge and slide into a portfolio with ease are perfect for the road warrior.</p>

<p>Consider your data needs as well: portable hotspot devices, which allow you to generate a mobile wireless connection and keep your company online and in the black as you process transactions on the road. And if you stay in the office? Weight and form factor matter less, of course, so you can focus your energy on pure processing power and reliability.</p>

<h2>Stay Ahead</h2>

<p>Infrastructure may bring to mind images of highways and bridges, but in the world of business it simply means the machines you rely on every day. Choose these wisely and free yourself up to focus on what matters most: your product, and the people who use it.</p>

<title>Top Four Computer Recycling and Disposal Tips</title>
<description>Waitdont throw that old computer in the landfill!</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Waitdont throw that old computer in the landfill! Recycling or reusing computers is easy 
<em>and</em> good for the environment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seventy-five percent of all obsolete computing equipment is currently in storage. In other words, its gathering dust in that unused office, shoved under a desk somewhere, or being used as a plant stand in the corner. But good options for disposal and recycling of old computers abound.</p>

<p>The following are EasyTechs top tips for safely getting rid of unused computer equipment. Youll free up storage space while helping our environment stay clean and green.</p>

<h2>Computer Recycling</h2>

<p>Many of the basic components in an old computer can be reused. This includes plastic from keyboards, metal from computer housing, and glass from older monitors. At the same time, toxic substances in computers like lead and cadmium need to be kept out of landfills and groundwater. Since January 2012, Staples has recycled more than five million pounds of electronics.</p>

<p>Fortunately, computer recycling is now an easy option in most communities. Many towns have public drop-off stations for your unused equipment, while computer retailers such as Staples offer 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/easy-on-the-planet/recycling-and-eco-services.html">free recycling</a> as well. These recyclers will ensure electronic equipment and batteries are responsibly reused.</p>

<h2>Computer Reuse</h2>

<p>Recycling your old computers is a great choice when they are broken and beyond repair, but equipment that still works can be sold or donated to charity. Many schools, churches, and other community organizations will be happy to take your computers when your office decides to make an upgrade. In fact, computers that are broken yet repairable are often welcomed by these kinds of institutions. (Be sure to ask before donating equipment that is not in working order.)</p>

<p>Another option, offered by Dell and Goodwill, is called 
<a href="http://reconnectpartnership.com">the Dell Reconnect program</a>. This service is a residential computer-recycling program that offers recyclers the opportunity to drop off old gear at Goodwill locations. This free service is tax deductible and not only are you recycling gear, youre also giving the community an opportunity to use technology they might otherwise be unable to afford.</p>

<p>Selling your outdated computing equipment is another option. Many businesses may be surprised to know that their unwanted computers can be listed on popular classified ad sites and turned into a bit of extra cash. Just because you might not need those old computers doesnt mean someone else might not, and if thats the case there are effective recycling programs out there like 
<a href="http://www.gazelle.com">Gazelle</a> that actually pay you fairly well for your gear when its no longer wanted.</p>

<h2>Computer Upgrades</h2>

<p>We all like brand new thingsnew cars, new houses, new computers. But before you decide on junking your old computer equipment, find out whether component upgrades might be a better option. The addition of more memory or storage, or adding better graphics capability, can give an old computer new life. RAM upgrades might save you money and reduce your impact on the environment.</p>

<p>You might also be able to use some of the components in your old computers with your newer systems. Old hard drives can serve as data storage or backup receptacles. Your old monitor can be hooked up in tandem with a new monitor for extra viewing area (a dual monitor setup often provides small business users with a productivity boost. Want to know how? Its a snap! Just follow these 
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976064">official dual-monitor setup instructions from Microsoft</a>).</p>

<h2>Before You Recycle</h2>

<p>Proper computer disposal means being careful of our environment. It also means being careful with the data those old computers contain. You dont want customer or financial information getting into the wrong hands when you dispose of your computers.</p>

<p>Erasing files from your computer wont be enough to keep a determined data thief from getting at your information. Data-wiping software can make information retrieval more difficult, although even this might not stop a sophisticated crook.</p>

<p>If you are donating or selling old computers and they contain sensitive information, you might consider removing the hard drive first and disposing of it separately. Retailers that offer computer recycling usually ensure that data is effectively destroyed in their disposal process, so this is a good option when privacy is a concern.</p>

<p>Learn how a computer ages over time, and how you can get the best performance out of it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Its easy to be seduced by the promise of a new computer. All those graphics, blazing video, instantaneous load timesits just about as beautiful as technology can get.</p>

<p>After youve made the purchase, you feel like youre holding pure possibility in your hands. Surely, youd think, the many frustrations youve experienced with your aging machine will now be a thing of the past. This computerthis fancy, new computerwill be the one that gets it right, once and for all. Youll never need another.</p>

<p>At least not for a year, anyway. Because thats how long it takes for new computers to begin to show their age. Somewhere around this time, all those shiny parts begin to break down and raise your blood pressure once again.</p>

<p>In this column, we walk you through the full life cycle of a computer, highlighting the various milestones youre likely to encounter along the way. Think of it as a journey from unboxing to unburdening, from setup to letup.</p>

<p>Just one word of advice before we begin: print this article now. Your printers about to croak, too.</p>

<h2>Stage One: Infancy</h2>

<p>At the magical moment of purchase, your computer is perfect. No dust has collected in its vents, no buttons have worn down from use, and every internal component is working precisely as it should.</p>

<p>If computers had no moving parts whatsoever, this is likely how it would remain for 10 years or more. But even solid-state drives require a fan, spinning optical drives, and peripherals that must withstand a daily beating.</p>

<p>So how should you protect yourself starting on day one? Although the chance of failure is smaller today than it will ever be again, theres no such thing as an infallible technology. Invest in a few preventive measures, just in case.</p>

<p>If your manufacturers warranty seems a little thin, consider extending it for a fraction of what you might otherwise spend on out-of-pocket repairs. And dont forget about data backup, a smart choice whether your machine is a day or a decade old. Check out cloud backup services like 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/carbonite-online-backup/index.html">Carbonite</a>, 
<a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>.</p>

<h2>Stage Two: Prime of Life</h2>

<p>Say what you will about middle age; for computers, it can be an era of peaceful productivity. Yes, your tower or laptop may have lost a step or two, but what is gone in CPU cycles has been gained in familiarity. You now know your machines quirks and habits, and have grown to trust it implicitly. Shortcuts and customizations have kept the magic going all this time. Your computer is a part of you, and you wouldnt dream of giving it upyet.</p>

<p>But under the hood, ominous changes are afoot. Your computers moving parts are now settling, maturing, and beginning to break down. After a year, the chance of a catastrophic failure jumps to between two and three percenthardly a nightmare scenario, but much higher than it was.</p>

<p>You can protect yourself by keeping all of the fans and vents clean and by performing regular spring cleaning, such as removing unused software and 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/young-again-making-your-old-pc-perform-like-new/rekindling-the-flame-returning-your-fourth-year-laptop-to-its-first-year-level.html">defragmenting the drive</a>. If commonly used applications are taking longer than ever to open, it may be time to consider 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/easytech-explains-lets-talk-memory-4/easytech-explains-lets-talk-memory-4.html">installing more RAM</a>.</p>

<h2>Stage Three: The Twilight Years</h2>

<p>And now, we ease gently into the sunset of your computers productive life cycle. After two to four years, new problems will begin to appear both inside and out. Spinning drives, cooling fans, and laptop batteries no longer work the way they once did. Your favorite old software may be slowing to a crawl, and new releases barely stand a chance.</p>

<p>Whats worse, your computers innards are teeming with pathogens. Malware, bloatware, and unwanted gibberish are slowly filling the drive, forcing your computer to work harder to save and retrieve new data. One day, a terrifying software glitch drives home the point that your chance of catastrophic failure is rising by the day. The time has almost come.</p>

<p>But you dont have to go down without a fight. Even older computers can be repaired in many ways. If youve been practicing good data backup, you can always swap out the hard drive for something bigger and cheaper. Plenty of good software options are available to help rid your computer of unwanted software.</p>

<p>Plus, physical cleaning can actually make a significant difference. Blast your vents and innards with compressed air, and lubricate the moving parts for a smoother spin. When all else fails, you can even attempt a clean install, by which you wipe the drive back to factory settings and reinstall your operating system from scratch.</p>

<h2>The Circle of Life</h2>

<p>The big question as your computer approaches its twilight years is comfort versus expense: at what point is it more practical to just buy a new computer instead of pouring resources into an old one?</p>

<p>Ask yourself what you really need that machine to do, and how much you would pay to have one that does all those things a bit faster. Consider the time and effort it takes to do shopping, research, and data migration. And then steel yourself for what is to come.</p>

<p>Just dont get too attached to the latest toy as you walk out of the store. Because some daynot today, but some dayits going to break, too. Its the circle of life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EasyTech shares five quick tips for getting the maximum from your laptop battery.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your laptop battery lets you work on the fly, but do you know how to squeeze the most out of it? Here are five tips for conserving battery power on your machine.</p>

<h2>1. Using an AC connection? Don't double dip.</h2>

<p>Even when youre plugged in, your laptops processes tax your battery. A simple solution is to pop the battery out and keep it handy when you know youll be working from an outlet for long stretches of time. Also, use that AC time (instead of precious battery power) to charge your phone, upload photos and update your mp3 player.</p>

<h2>2. Make your system more efficient.</h2>

<p>Learn how to 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/maintenance/battery.aspx#fbid=-s9U7ItdkSO">optimize power settings</a> and keep operations running smoothly by making certain steps routine:
 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/four-tips-to-make-your-pc-faster-than-ever.html">Defrag your hard drive</a> often.
 Remove external devices and USB plugins when theyre not in use.
 Disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, which use power in their constant search for connections.
 Dim your screen.
 Disable Flash and your screensaver if you don't need them.
 Close unused programs instead of running them in the background.</p>

<h2>3. Try a power management program.</h2>

<p>Programs like 
<a href="http://www.reviversoft.com/battery-optimizer/download/">Battery Optimizer</a> use diagnostic tools to calculate how much power youll save by turning off unnecessary features. They automate your settings for you and even give you real-time graphics showing how much power you have left and how many more battery recharges are in your future. 
<a href="http://www.1e.com/it-efficiency/software/nightwatchman-enterprise-pc-power-management/">NightWatchman</a>is another popular option.</p>

<h2>4. Keep it cool.</h2>

<p>Heat is your batterys natural enemy. Make sure your fans are working and keep the vents dust free with an occasional blast from a can of compressed air. Running games and videos can really raise your machines temperature. Be sure its resting on a hard surface, where it gets better ventilation than when sinking into a sofa or your lap.</p>

<h2>5. Add more RAM.</h2>

<p>Bumping up your laptops memory is an inexpensive fix that not only helps your hard drive, but also saves battery power. The reason? When your machine runs out of RAM, it uses virtual memory instead of the hard drive to run applications  which takes a toll on battery life. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/easytech-explains-lets-talk-memory-4/easytech-explains-lets-talk-memory-4.html">Checking to be sure you have optimal RAM</a> is simple. And if you do add RAM, you'll see the benefit to your battery power right away.</p>

<p>The most surprising thing about these tools is how easy they are to implement. Try them out now, and youll save yourself the stress of scanning for that outlet at the airport or coffee shop.</p>

<title>Back to School: Keep in Touch with the Latest Tech</title>
<description>Technology keeps you connected to your kids after they leave for college, no matter the distance. Avoid communications overkill and learn to use tools like social media to keep in touch (and to resist the urge to text your student every day).</description>

<p>Technology keeps you connected to your kids after they leave for college, no matter the distance. Avoid communications overkill and learn to use tools like social media to keep in touch
<strong> </strong>(and to
<strong> </strong>resist the urge to text your student every day).</p></blockquote>

<p>Remember when you left home for college? Communication between you and your parents, by necessity, dropped to a once-a-week long-distance phone call.</p>

<p>What a difference a generation makes. Todays tech allows parents and college kids to communicate whenever they want. Video conferencing, texting, and social media allow you to keep in touch whether your child goes to college at home or abroad.</p>

<h2>Cell Phones and Texting</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/mobile-phones/index.html?cmSearchKeyword=cell+phones">Cell phones</a> make it possible to call your children anywhere, at any time. Some kids take full advantage of this, making quick calls home between classes, sending pictures of the campus taken with their phone camera, and firing off texts (hopefully not in class).</p>

<p>Parents need to use cell phones with care: it can be tempting to phone college kids once a day. Remember that your child will be busy with clubs, friends, social activities, and studying, so they might not appreciate unexpected phone calls. Talk to your child about convenient times to make phone calls.</p>

<p>On the other hand, sending a cute picture of the family pet or texting a funny story about the neighborhood can occur at any time, as the student has the option of waiting to view the message.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>Chatting on Skype and Instant Messaging</h2>

<p>Instant messaging is another communication optionexpect your typing skills to improve while chatting online (you might want to learn some chat abbreviations for easier communication).</p>

<p>Nothing, however, matches talking face-to-face with your college kid. Make sure your kids laptop or computer has a webcam, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/walkthrough-galleries/an-eyeball-friendly-look-at-pc-peripheral-installs.html">add a webcam</a> to your own computer, and sign up for a free account with an easy-to-use video conferencing service such as 
<a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/">Skype</a>.</p>

<h2>Social Media: Friending Your Kids</h2>

<p>Chances are good that your child has a Facebook page, a Google+ profile, or a Twitter account. Social media offers you the option of chatting, sharing pictures, and playing games with distant family members.</p>

<p>You can stay in touch with students through social media, but ask your child before you send that Friend request. Some kids use social media exclusively for communication with friends, and may not want to worry about what dad will think every time they post something. (Think back to your own early adulthood: would you have wanted your parents listening in on conversations with friends?)</p>

<p>One solution is to ask your child to change their privacy settings so you dont see every post, and use Facebook to send private messages. While your son might appreciate a heart-felt I miss you note, he probably doesnt want his friends to see it.</p>

<h2>Email Options</h2>

<p>Todays kids think of email as a quaint and archaic method of communication that the old folks use, preferring instead to communicate with each other by text and instant messaging. That doesnt, however, mean that you should ignore email as a method of communication.</p>

<p>Emails allow you to send longer, more detailed messages than texts, and offer more privacy than instant messaging. You can even use email as a type of electronic care package and buy online gift certificates to send to your college student.</p>

<h2>Online Games</h2>

<p>How tech savvy are you? Online games offer an opportunity to reach out to college kids, whether youre playing a game of virtual chess or facing them across the battlefield in a fantasy game. Combining online gaming with a Skype call can become the online equivalent of gathering around the table for a game of Scrabble.</p>

<h2>The Old-Fashioned Care Package</h2>

<p>Despite all the electronic options for communication, dont neglect the time-honored care package. A package of homemade cookies or local snacks during exam week comes as a pleasant surprise, and helps combat the stress of college life.</p>

<title>Balancing the Home Office and the Family Computer</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Working from a home PC exposes your business to a security threat graver than the worlds most ruthless hackersyour family. Thats why our tech experts have outlined these best practices to help protect your work from play on the family PC.</p></blockquote>

<p>A home business conjures images of a small, cozy workspace with a computer dedicated solely for business use. Family members do not touch the computer, understanding that the success of the business rides, in no small part, on the machine.</p>

<p>Ah, the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/meet-todays-efficient-home-officesmall-business.html">ideal home office</a>. So wonderful, so productive, and for many home business owners, sounattainable. Tough budgeting decisions often mean a business computer doubles as the family computer, which reduces the security of business information. Fortunately, a few simple precautions allow you to strike a balance between work and play.</p>

<h2>Work and PlayIn That Order</h2>

<p>First, and perhaps most importantly, every member of the family needs to understand that work takes precedence over play where the computer is concerned. When youre working, no one has any rights to the computer at all. After business activities, homework has priority, with entertainment coming in a distant third.</p>

<p>Explain to kids (and partners) that the success of your business directly affects family finances. The more productive you are, the more money comes in (along with the tempting possibility of a second computer in the future).</p>

<h2>Keep Accounts Separate</h2>

<p>All family members should have their own user profile, with their own user name and password. If you use Windows, you can find User Account settings in the Control Panel.</p>

<p>Separate accounts provide several advantages. Consider the desktop. Customizing the desktop is one of the first things most people do with their computer. Logging in to your business computer to find the teenager rearranged your icons and changed your wallpaper irritates you and reduces your productivity. Separate user profiles also keep your documents separate from those of other family members, so you can keep your business files organized.</p>

<p>If youre using Windows, make sure that your assign yourself administrator privileges and all other users have standard profile accounts. Standard accounts can install and remove programs, but cannot make system-wide changes that affect all users. As the only administrator, you have complete control over the computer.</p>

<h2>Control Downloads</h2>

<p>Unsafe downloads can introduce spyware and viruses into your computer. Family members need to understand that downloads constitute a potential business threat.</p>

<p>You may decide to completely prohibit downloads, but thats exactly the type of rule that children seem hardwired to ignore. A less stringent option allows family members to download material once you give it the okay. Point out that this doesnt just protect you; it also protects the computer, and by extension, family members computer use.</p>

<p>If you already use an antivirus program such as Norton or McAfee, check the program settings for parental controls or Internet blocking features. You can set these to prevent users from accessing suspicious or malicious sites. (EasyTech offers 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/view-all-services/">Peace of Mind</a> services that can help you set up your antivirus programs.)</p>

<h2>Update and Patch Frequently</h2>

<p>Updating antivirus programs and installing operating-system security patches protects any computer, but is especially important for a computer that combines vital business information with family use. Schedule regular update checks for both your operating system and virus protection program.</p>

<h2>Dont Back Down on Backups</h2>

<p>If your business relies on a single computer, regular backups are essential. Information loss comes in many forms. A virus might delete vital files. Your hard drive might suddenly die. The two-year-old might pour a glass of milk through the CPUs ventilation screens. In any of these cases, if you dont have a backup, your business screeches to a sudden, and possibly permanent, halt.</p>

<p>You can upload information into the cloud, back up vital files on USB drives, or use an 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/cat_CL160403">external hard drive</a>. Just make sure you back up regularly. Taking a few minutes to back up every Friday afternoon could save your business.</p>

<p>The low battery warning on your laptop can create a level of aggravation normally reserved for parking tickets and failed Glee DVR recording sessions. Batteries must die, of course, but these simple tips will help extend their life and your sanity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our laptops, smartphones, and tablets have set us free. They make doing business from the road simple and convenient. Or at least theyre supposed to. A computing device whose battery wont last a single day takes a lot of the mobile out of mobile computing.</p>

<p>But there are ways to extend your battery life. Doing so will not only improve your mobile computing experience, youll also reduce your impact on the environment. Extending battery life is central to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-earth-friendly-business-the-easytech-guide-to-going-green-with-technology.html">green-computing</a> best practices.</p>

<h2>5 Tips for Better Battery Life</h2>

<p>If noon rolls around and you find yourself already charging your smartphone or laptop, youre likely in need of battery-life management. Cut down on battery consumption using these five green-computing tips.</p>

<p> Dim your screen. The screen on your mobile device is the single largest draw on battery power. Most people know they can dim their laptop screen but you may not be aware this is possible on your tablet and smartphone too. Unless your vision requires the brightest setting, dim your screen and you might add an hour to battery life.</p>

<p> Turn off that app. Apps are cool. They let us keep tabs on the weather in Antarctica and automatically update us on what our friends are doing on Facebook. They also use a lot of battery power, and running several apps in the backgroundthat is, switching to a new application without shutting down the previous onecan take its toll on your smartphone. Turn off apps you arent using and check in to Facebook manually.</p>

<p> Turn off Wi-Fi. Many tablets and most laptops carry Wi-Fi capacity for web access. Such tools are great for staying in touch with the home office, but consider turning them off when you dont need them to save battery power. You may consider turning off data access on your smartphone too except, when checking email or using the Internet.</p>

<p> Keep It Cool. Your mobile device works better when its cool, and so does its battery. Heat can reduce a batterys lifespan and even destroy it. Keep your laptop vents clean and your tablet out of the sun. Never leave a mobile device in the car during summer months. Store batteries in a cool, dry place.</p>

<p> Know thy Battery: Mobile computing devices generally use one of two types of batteries: NiMH/NiCd (nickel-metal hydride/nickel cadmium) and lithium ion. The latter are gaining in popularity since lithium-ion batteries carry greater charges, last longer between charges, and can be charged more often before replacement. They are thus the greener choice as well. Knowing which battery your mobile device uses is important since they have different charging requirements. The NiMH/NiCd batteries should be allowed to discharge completely before recharging. Allowing your lithium-ion batteries to discharge completely, however, can ruin them.</p>

<h2>Automated Battery Life Management</h2>

<p>If all of this activityturning apps and Wi-Fi off and onseems like work, you may be a candidate for automated battery management. These tools automatically detect when your smartphone needs a Wi-Fi connection and switches it on. When Wi-Fi isnt available or unneeded, battery power is saved. Various apps can be set to turn off and on as well. Tools built into your phone can be found in the Settings menu, while third-party apps are available too. Search Battery Management in your devices App Store.</p>

<p>Automated or not, battery management will give you better control of your mobile computing experience. Youll also be practicing green computing, for which the Earth will thank you.</p>

<p>Utilizing mobile increases productivity and flexibility. Late nights at the office can now be spent on the couch in those tattered sweats from the dorm days. EasyTech has provided the information you need for a safe and easy transition for your business.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lets face it: Small-business owners arent always the most avid early adopters of new technology. Its easy to get comfortable using the technology you already know. But sometimes that technology finds its way into your company whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>Case in point: mobile computing devices such as tablets and smartphones, which are 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/rise-of-the-mobile-computing-machines.html">spreading like wildfire</a> through the business world. Resistance is almost certainly futile, so the best thing you can do is embrace these devices and craft some smart policies governing their usage.</p>

<h2>Think Compatibility</h2>

<p>Mobile computing works best when all the devices on your network play nice. One way to ensure compatibility is to mandate that all your employees carry the same phoneor at least the same operating systemon their phone. Alas, this approach all but guarantees youll be on the hook for purchasing those devices yourselfnot a great option for many SBOs.</p>

<p>One good alternative is to choose company-wide mobile software (apps) that will be used for all storage and collaboration. Take a look at some widely loved platforms like 
<a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, 
<a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>, 
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, 
<a href="http://www.box.com">Box</a>, and 
<a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> for seamless cross-compatible productivity.</p>

<h2>Think Security</h2>

<p>Your top priority when it comes to mobile computing is security: keeping your companys correspondence and data away from prying eyes. To lock down your precious IP, make sure all of your companys mobile devices are password- or passkey-protected.</p>

<p>Invest in mobile antivirus software from the likes of Symantec or McAfee, and consider encrypting your company data whenever it travels beyond the walls of your company. These simple steps can repel most hacking attacks, letting you sleep soundly at night without suffering nightmares of a lost smartphone. (And, dont forget to 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/do-this-now-define-your-mobile-security-policy.html">define your mobile security policy</a>.)</p>

<h2>Think Caution</h2>

<p>Not every mobile computing device policy is about hardware or software. Sometimes the biggest threats come from so-called wetware, which is to say the three or so pounds of tissue between your employees ears.</p>

<p>Cognitive errors and poor judgment create ample opportunities for 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/new-malware-threats-take-shape-in-2012-3.html">malware</a> to get into your companys network. Direct your employees to avoid the most common mistakes on their mobile devices: clicking suspicious links, visiting unsavory websites, and responding to phishing attacks with credulous honesty.</p>

<h2>Think Ahead</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid mobile threats is to codify these steps into a comprehensive mobile policy, and to update it often. So-called bring your own device (BYOD) policies are rapidly becoming the norm these days as new employees arrive fully married to their phones and tablets.</p>

<p>By preparing some best practices for compatibility, security, and employee habits, you can avoid the most costly mobile mishaps and keep your business free of bottlenecks. And who knows? You might even find all those tiny mobile devices actually make your company bigger.</p>

<p>All businesses are susceptible to computer threats like hackers and viruses. Making matters worse is the great deal of misinformation floating around regarding computer security. Our EasyTech associates have cleared up some common misconceptions.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Internet attracts urban legends and myths the way car-door handles in ghost stories attract bloody hooks. Computer security isnt immune from this trend, and many security facts are, at best, inaccurate. Some of these myths are recent developments, while others have been around for years. So gather around the virtual campfire, kidsits time to tell (and refute) some scary stories.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>1. The Antivirus Industry Creates Viruses</h2>

<p>Lets deal with a completely loopy, but oddly pervasive, computer security myth first: the idea that the antivirus companies develop and release computer viruses to maintain sales. This myth is especially popular among the type of people who treat 
<em>The X-Files</em> as a documentary and refer to the general populace as sheeple during forum discussions.</p>

<p>The myth assumes that the entire antivirus industry is engaged in a highly secretive and encompassing conspiracy to defraud computer users. By the same logic, firefighters are arsonists and farmers engineered hunger so theyd have a market for their crops.</p>

<p>While its true a variety of malware called ransomware infects computers and then sells a solution to the problem, these rogue programs are not affiliated with legitimate 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=antivirus&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home&amp;amp;searchViewTypeGridList=listView">antivirus programs</a>.</p>

<h2>2. The Internet is My Main Security Threat</h2>

<p>A security policy that only considers Internet-based threats is woefully incomplete. Yes, hackers can breach your network security. Yes, malware can infect your network through unsafe websites. However, the biggest risks to your security work for you.</p>

<p>Many security breaches originate with employees. A small number of employees are simply dishonest. Disgruntled ex-employees may walk out of the office with USBs full of information, or use still-valid passwords to access your database.</p>

<p>More often, however, human error causes security breaches. An employee loses a laptop, for instance, or incorrectly disposes of printed information. Social engineering attacks understand that a friendly or authoritative phone call can breach security much faster than a complicated computer hack.</p>

<p>Dont neglect online protection, but never underestimate the human element when you consider network security.</p>

<h2>3. Macs are Safer than Windows PCs</h2>

<p>For years, Apple users held up the relative lack of malware on Macs as evidence that the Apple operating system had fewer security flaws than Windows operating systems.</p>

<p>Actually, Mac users were safer because they represented a relatively small percentage of all computer users. Malware writers prefer to target the largest possible audience. As so many people use Windows, the hackers focused their attention on Windows and ignored Apple.</p>

<p>People now use Apple devices in sufficient numbers to attract malware. In 2012, the Flashback Trojan affected 600,000 Macs. Using a Mac does not render you immune to viral attacks.</p>

<h2>4. Windows is Insecure</h2>

<p>Directly related to the above myth, this one takes the view that Windows must lack security because so many malware programs use Windows vulnerabilities to infect machines.</p>

<p>Microsoft patches and security updates actually do a very good job of keeping Windows secureas long as the user installs the updates. Many successful malware programs rely on security vulnerabilities that Windows patched months if not years ago, because people neglect to update their operating systems.</p>

<h2>5. Hackers Only Target the Big Players</h2>

<p>Some small businesses take false comfort in their size. The assumption is that hackers and data thieves only target big companies, major financial institutions, and government agencies.</p>

<p>Hacking into a major credit card companys databases may represent a major triumph for hackers, but such targets have significant security and are difficult to breach. On the other hand, while small-business data offers less financial gain, obtaining it presents considerably less difficulty and risk.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: A hacking attack on a large company requires the planning and execution seen in a major armed bank heist. Breaching a small businesss security is more on par with shoplifting. The fact that one crime offers more rewards does not mean criminals ignore the lesser offense.</p>

<h2>6. If I Dont Download Anything, Im Safe from Malware</h2>

<p>Never believe this statement. Too often people believe that if they dont download anything from the Internet and only visit trusted sites, theyll keep 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/state-of-security-address-todays-pc-malware-and-spyware-landscape.html">malware</a> off their computer.</p>

<p>The myth leads to an important question: what exactly do we mean by a trusted site? Do we mean a site that we use frequently without any apparent problems, a site with a well-established reputation or a website that antivirus programs declare safe?</p>

<p>All of those definitions could describe a trusted site, and all could prove to be false in a second. A website can contain malicious code and viruses that infect your computer, whether you download anything or not. Hackers can insert malicious code into sites that would normally be perfectly safe.</p>

<p>While many people assiduously avoid downloading anything from websites, theyre quick to open email attachments, particularly if the attachment comes from an email address they trust. Malware often spreads by piggybacking on email attachments that appear to originate from legitimate sources.</p>

<h2>7. You Can Get a Virus just by Visiting Facebook.</h2>

<p>The most honest answer to this question is maybe, though youre unlikely to infect a computer by logging into Facebook, and reading your friends posts.</p>

<p>However, following links in those posts could expose you to malware, especially if malware compromised your friends account. Be especially suspicious of any link that seems at odds with a friend's character. (A link to a YouTube fight video, for instance, would be unusual to find in a post by a friend who deplores violence.)</p>

<p>Facebook also supports a vast array of games, surveys, and other third-party applications. The safety of such applications varies widely. Avoid Facebook third-party apps if youre accessing the website from work, and think carefully before accepting an apps terms of use if youre using a personal computer.</p>

<p>Todays computer security myths all have one thing in commonthey can lull you into a false sense of security. Keep your PC free from viruses by always employing a critical eye and common sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rampant smartphone adoption means landlines are an easy expense cut for businesses. But working from your personal phone adds new risks. (Have you ever sent a text/email to the wrong person?) Our EasyTech associates have identified these important factors to be considered for mobile security.</p></blockquote>

<p>Times were, folks liked to keep their business and personal lives apartthe office was an office, the home was a home. Today, these lines can get a bit blurred. The advent of mobile communicationsmartphones, tablets, laptops, and the rise of telecommutinghas turned the whole world into one giant work environment.</p>

<p>Such technological developments are certainly a boon to business productivity, but do they come at a cost? Here, well look at the upside, and downside, of keeping your business and personal phone lines separate.</p>

<h2>Business Communication in the New Millennium</h2>

<p>Before making the decision to pull the plug on your company phone and do everything, business and personal, from your smartphone, we should take a look at how businesses communicate in the 21
<sup>st</sup> century. Inventions like Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Skype, and videoconferencing have revolutionized the way we talk. Todays business phone is a lot more than just a handset and dial.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>VoIP. </strong>VoIP is a simple concept with a complicated name. Plainly put, VoIP lets you talk through the Internet rather than through the phone lines. With this technology, you can attach your landline to your computer or use the computer itself to make calls. Likewise, your recipients can be computer, mobile phone, or landline users. The advantage is that VoIP calls can be made to almost anyone anywhere, and are much cheaper than standard calls. Many are free, even overseas.
<strong></strong></li>

<li>
<strong>Skype. </strong>Skype is a proprietary VoIP application that has become very popular in recent years. The software is free to download, and calls made to other Skype users are free as well. Calls to mobile phones and landlines cost only a few cents a minute. With the recent addition of videoconferencing capability, Skype is a handy tool for the modern business. 
<strong></strong></li>

<li>
<strong>Videoconferencing. </strong>With the cost of travel rising precipitously in recent years, the prospect of face-to-face videoconferencing has excited many businesses. Only a few years ago though, this prospect was marred by technological limitations by which video signals were regularly lost or scrambled and picture quality was poor. Recent advances in the carrying capacity of broadband Internet, however, have improved videoconferencing a great deal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Skype and other developers offer low-priced, high-quality video communications to anyone with a computer and a webcam.
<strong> </strong>With Skype, up to 10 people can videoconference at once.
<strong> </strong></p>

<h2>So Whats the Downside?</h2>

<p>Given that todays businesses have these many tools at their disposalallowing for inexpensive, quality communicationswhats wrong with keeping your business and personal phones separate? Why are many people ditching the business line and doing everything through their smartphone?</p>

<p>Its really just a matter of personal preference. For some, the advantage of using one phone for all calls seems simpler and more streamlined. Others find that a dedicated business line with VoIP capabilities lets them keep better track of company matters. It may be easier, for example, to track business expenses that way.</p>

<p>Whichever way you go, staying in touch with customers, partners, and fellow employees is easier than ever.</p>

<title>Windows Phone Security Tips and Tools</title>

<blockquote>
<p>We assume you threw out the instruction manual that came with your Windows phone. Youre not the first. No need to fret EasyTechs got you covered. Heres what you need to keep the private data on your Windows phone, well, private.</p></blockquote>

<p>Microsoft has worked hard to address the security gaps that have long plagued its PC platforms. Now, the company is trying to improve security on its Windows Phonebefore it becomes a widespread concern.</p>

<p>If you have a Windows Phone, be sure to follow Microsofts advicealong with some extra precautionsto stay safe. The following are our top tools, tips, and tactics for doing just that.</p>

<h2>Antivirus Protection: Maintain a Bug-free Phone</h2>

<p>Enabling frequent updates to your phone is key to guarding against viruses. Microsoft is already scoping out the biggest threats to Windowsdont screw up by failing to install the patches and updates they offer.</p>

<p>A note about apps: Its true they need Microsofts approval (and electronic signature) to enter the marketplace, but you still must exercise caution when downloading. Take particular note of the permissions youre allowing, or use 
<a href="http://mylookout.com">Lookout Mobile Securitys </a>Premium version to see a summary of the permissions youve already granted.</p>

<p>Lookout is one of several viable options for expanding antivirus protection beyond your phones basics. 
<a href="http://symantec.com">Symantec</a> and 
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/184739/android_app_alert_mobile_defense_hits_the_market.html">Mobile Defense</a> also offer good software for consumers as well as SMBs.</p>

<h2>Antitheft Tools: Keep Your Phone out of the Wrong Hands</h2>

<p>Microsoft gives you the option of password-protecting your phone with a PIN. Do it. And read up on choosing effective passwords. Using your birthday or 1-2-3-4 wont cut it.</p>

<p>Another must: activate Find my phone. This feature not only helps you find your phone if its snatched, but also lets you remotely lock it and wipe it clean of data so thieves can't access the goods.</p>

<p>Lookout again leads a respectable field of contenders that offer cutting-edge mobile management protection for SMBs. Other sound programs come from 
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/213762/notify_technology_unveils_ondemand_mobile_device_management.html">NotifyMDM</a>, 
<a href="http://www.symantec.com/mobile-device-security">Symantec</a>, and 
<a href="http://zenprise.com">Zenprise</a>.</p>

<h2>Backup Tools: Simplify Storage for a Better Backup System</h2>

<p>Microsoft responded well to early criticism about its clunky backup systems. Now you can simply sync your phone with your 
<a href="http://home.live.com">Windows Live</a> account and keep everything in the cloud. Some homebrew types, however, prefer the 
<a href="http://www.wpxbox.com/windows-phone-sms-backup-app-can-now-backup-facebook-live-chat-messages/">SMS Backup</a> app for their documents and data.</p>

<p>More and more, SMBs are looking to the bigger providers of 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/carbonite-online-backup/">cloud services</a> to back up their networks. If thats the approach youre taking, be sure your system is set up to back up your Windows Phone, too.</p>

<h2>Encryption Software: Make Sensitive Data Safe</h2>

<p>Microsoft has already made it possible to encrypt data on Windows Phones. Theyll even 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh487164%28v=vs.92%29.aspx">walk you through</a> the fairly straightforward process for doing so. But the company 
<a href="http://www.wpxbox.com/windows-phone-sms-backup-app-can-now-backup-facebook-live-chat-messages/">made headlines</a> recently when it partnered with Good Technology to develop high-end encryption tools for handling large amounts of sensitive data thats good news for businesses looking for tighter security.</p>

<p>While these suggestions go a long way toward keeping your Windows Phone secure, business owners should remember that a single slip-up can have major consequences. Make sure you dont forget about mobile devices when crafting your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/do-this-now-define-your-mobile-security-policy.html">companys security policy</a>.</p>

<title>Top 4 Small-Office Productivity Apps</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it seems like theres an app for everything (Karaoke on the go? Mobile burrito location? Very real). At EasyTech, weve gone in a more valuable direction: the best apps for small-business productivity.</p></blockquote>

<p>The EasyTech staff loves productivity apps. Lengthy water-cooler arguments break out over the best and most productive apps, which is a little counterintuitive, as app debates can last for hours around here. At the risk of sparking yet another two-hour water-cooler argument, here are a few apps that can turn your small business into a productivity powerhouse.</p>

<h2>Voice Recognition Software</h2>

<p>Voice recognition software translates dictation into text. If, like certain EasyTech writers, youre a three-fingered typist, voice recognition software takes the tediousness out of composing emails and documents. You simply talk, and the software does the typing for you.</p>

<p>In a rare moment of consensus, EasyTech staff all praised the accuracy of 
<a href="http://http://www.staples.com/office/supplies/StaplesSearch?searchkey=nuances+dragon&amp;amp;storeId=10001&amp;amp;catalogId=10051&amp;amp;langId=-1&amp;amp;fromUrl=home">Nuances Dragon Naturally Speaking</a> software. Dragon does an amazing job of accurately recognizing human speech. The program transcribes speech almost three times faster than typing. Add a wireless headset and you can dictate without being tied to your office chair.</p>

<h2>Drop in on Dropbox</h2>

<p>Youve probably heard of 
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, but knowing about the cloud storage system and experiencing it are entirely different matters. Dropbox installs a folder on your desktop. Any files added to the folder are automatically backed up to the cloud. You can give other Dropbox users permission to access and modify documents in your Dropbox, making the app a useful collaboration tool.</p>

<p>A free Dropbox account comes with 2 GB of storage. Users can also pay $10 to $20 monthly subscription fees for 50 to 100 GB of secure storage space.</p>

<h2>Accounting Software</h2>

<p>For many home/small-business owners, accounting is a necessary evil. You have to track earnings, bill clients, and process payments, but your real talents probably lay in other areas.</p>

<p>Accounting software such as 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/technology-research-centers/software/quickbooks.html?cmSearchKeyword=quickbooks">QuickBooks</a> recognizes that not all business owners are accountants, and it crunches the numbers for you using intuitive, easy-to-read spreadsheets, and accounting templates. The less time you spend balancing the books, the more time you have left for business.</p>

<h2>Small, Time-Saving Apps</h2>

<p>Many of the apps used by EasyTech staff are small pieces of software designed to make office life easier and reduce the time spent performing mundane tasks. Note-taking apps rank high in popularity, especially if the app can synchronize over multiple devices and includes a search feature. We like 
<a href="www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>, which works on most devices.</p>

<p>Password managers also made the list, despite being dismissed by one staff member with an annoyingly good memory. A good password manager stores all your passwords and usernames, protected by a single, highly secure password. The better password managers can fill in personal information on forms and generate random, high-security passwords as needed.</p>

<p>With the widespread use of instant messaging, many people find themselves juggling multiple IM accounts. Multichat apps such as 
<a href="http://www.pidgin.im">Pidgin</a> act as a central hub for instant messengers. Just enter your login information for AIM, Google Talk, and other IMs into the app, and the software lets you chat on different systems from a single window.</p>

<p>To-do trackers range from simple virtual sticky notes to highly sophisticated task-management software. Picking task-manager software requires an understanding of how you work. If you carefully plot out every minute of your day, an app with calendar, reminder, and alert functions may fit your needs, such as Get it Done or HiTask. If, however, you take a less structured view of your workday, a simple to-do list app, like Clear, should keep you on track. And that, essentially, is the definition of a productivity app: Any software that helps you focus on work and reduces the time you spend on routine tasks.</p>

<title>Modern Mobile Security with Old-School Thinking </title>

<p>We have some bad news for your mobile device: Hackers, spies and thieves are eyeing it as their next target. And because your phones and tablets are key to operating your business, this is bad news for your business, too.</p>

<p>Now for the good news: thieves may have found a new target, but theyre generally using the same old strategies. Everything youve learned about protecting your PC still applies in the mobile realm. As The New York Times put it, The most practical rule for protecting yourself is to start thinking of the smartphone as a PC.</p>

<p>Heres how that translates into some common-sense ways to protect your phone.</p>

<h2>Set Up Your Devices for Maximum Security</h2>

<p>Just as you would with your PC, you should take full advantage of your mobile devices built-in security system.</p>

<ul>

<li>Resist the urge to disable your devices passcode locking system. The same goes for other security settings on your phone or tablet and the programs you use it for. Passwords and pop-up blockers might feel inconvenient in the moment, but theyre a lot less trouble than 
<a title="Hackers and malware" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/the-modern-malware-threat-2/the-modern-malware-threat.html" target="_blank">a hacker or Trojan horse.</a></li>

<li>Enable your mobile browsers privacy and security settings, just as you would with your PC. Then update the devices operating system regularly to get the security patches that protect against new threats.</li>

<li>Finally, think about how your employees are using their phones and tablets at work. If you have multiple users handling sensitive data, consider signing up for a mobile management/security service through the cloud.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Avoid Setting Yourself Up for Security Breaches</h2>

<p>Most hacking occurs when the victim launches a bad program or activates a suspect email. Clearly, hackers are counting on you to slip up.</p>

<ul>

<li>Do not respond to texts or open emails from unknown senders. In particular, be on guard for fraudulent messages that claim to be from your provider and ask you to supply personal information, authorize access to your account, or change your settings.</li>

<li>Take care when visiting unfamiliar websites and downloading programs and apps. Avoid free knockoff versions of popular games or any apps you dont truly need.</li>

<li>Apply the same security guidelines youve adopted for your employees PCs to their phones and tablets. Then make sure they follow these guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that we keep our phones closeby in our pockets or purses can offer a false sense of security. But think of that smartphone as the key to your companys front door and take these simple steps today. While these tips already should be second nature when dealing with your company PCs, (have you 
<a title="mobile security policy" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/do-this-now-define-your-mobile-security-policy.html" target="_blank">defined your mobile security policy</a> yet?), theyre just as critical when it comes to your mobile devices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Read about some of the most embarrassing security goofs  and learn how to avoid a similar fate.</p></blockquote>

<p>So you thought the world was going to end when you lost that company smartphone at the bar after work on Friday night? Feel better: When it comes to security breaches, there are horror stories that make yours look enviable.</p>

<p>After youve done a remote wipe of that smartphone, learn about some of the worst gaffes from recent years along with tips for avoiding a similar fate.</p>

<h2>ESTsoft</h2>

<p>In July 2011, attackers managed to get malware onto the update servers at ESTsoft, a South Korean application development company. Every site that used the firms apps was affected, and in a chain reaction, those machines also spread the malware.</p>

<p>As a result, the personal information of about 35 million South Koreans was exposed, which represents a majority of the countrys population. The breach was so severe that one international newspaper called it a hackocalypse.</p>

<p>
<em>Avoidance tip:</em> Even if your companys networks dont directly link to so many people, you should still be cautious about what goes out past the firewall. Regularly examine security logs that are issued from the system. These logs, along with automatic security controls, represent the first line of defense. If youre using Windows, look for multiple Logon Failure errors (also known as 529 events), since those could indicate someone is trying to hack the system.</p>

<h2>PlayStation Network</h2>

<p>Gamers met hackers in an ugly standoff in April 2011, when an attack on PlayStation Network took the service offline for 44 days. The company spent $170 million to restart and win back customer trust. In the meantime, 77 million accounts were exposed, including users credit card information.</p>

<p>The attack was done by Lulz Security (sometimes abbreviated as LulzSec), a hacker group that claims responsibility for other high-profile takedowns including a CIA website crash. The group believes its fostering more security by drawing attention to insecure systems and showing people the dangers of password reuse.</p>

<p>
<em>Avoidance tip:</em> Unless you run a government agency or a major technology firm, LulzSec isnt likely to come after you. However, their message about password protection shouldnt be ignored, either.</p>

<p>Password reuse is a very common security problem, because people tend to choose the same username/password combination for multiple devices and websites.</p>

<h2>RSA Security</h2>

<p>You might think a security firm would be immune to large-scale breaches, and thats probably what RSA Security thought, too. But in March 2011, the companys reputation took a major hit when attackers found a way into their networks and exposed 40 million employee records.</p>

<p>The hackers used spear phishing to launch their attacks, employing sophisticated email fraud to get unauthorized access to data. About a year later, RSAs president noted the breach cost the company $66 million in reparations and left RSA scrambling to regain customer trust.</p>

<p>
<em>Avoidance tip:</em> Spear phishing has been a regular occurrence ever since companies began introducing their employees to email. In order to prevent these types of problems, be sure to do a regular training with employees about security threats. Be sure to emphasize this message: Dont download anything from someone you dont know, even if it seems safe.</p>

<p>If a virus has gotten into the system through inadvertent download, the system will usually run slower or start issuing more error messages. For more information, check out our video on virus detection: 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/ask-anything-videos/curious-intern-mucks-up-office-security.html">Curious Intern Mucks Up Office PC Security.</a></p>

<h2>Monster.com</h2>

<p>Since this one happened in 2007, its considered an oldie in Internet time. However, it still holds valuable lessons for today. Monster.com took a hit when hackers obtained legitimate keys to the system, most likely by guessing passwords that belonged to recruiters.</p>

<p>Although it affected 1.3 million job seekers, the breach wouldnt have been notable if it hadnt been for Monsters delay in announcing the issue. While the company waited several days to tell users, the hackers were sending out scam emails to users and phishing for personal financial data. Monster received more criticism for their hesitation to admit the breach than for the breach itself.</p>

<p>
<em>Avoidance tip:</em> When a security issue crops up, inform affected users immediately. As the situation with ESTsoft demonstrates, a breach can quickly become a chain reaction that affects multiple sites and numerous users. It's better to suffer from temporary user disappointment than to lose customer and employee trust long-term.</p>

<h2>Gawker Media</h2>

<p>Gawker Media got slammed in December 2010, when hackers exposed the email addresses and passwords of about 1.3 million blog commenters. As if that werent bad enough, the attackers also nabbed the source code for Gawkers content management system, which meant they could publish whatever they wanted on the Gawker family of sites.</p>

<p>A group called Gnosis claimed responsibility, noting theyd done the attack because Gawker founder Nick Denton had told hackers to bring it on.</p>

<p>
<em>Avoidance tip</em>: Dont challenge hackers to attack your system. Its just not a good idea.</p>

<p>In general, no human-designed system is 100 percent secure, and any company can suffer from security breaches. The companies mentioned here all had strong controls in place and still got socked.</p>

<p>To avoid their fate, the best you can do is implement multiple levels of security, conduct regular antivirus and intrusion-detection checks and make sure you have that smartphone the next time you're leaving happy hour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Road warriors carry their offices with them, using a wide range of portable devices to connect with the home office and enhance presentations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once upon a time, sending an employee on a road trip meant cutting all contact with the office outside of phone calls. Delivering presentations meant transporting cumbersome posters, slides, and other materials. Negotiations with a potential business partner were limited by the information the employee had on hand. The business road warriors effectiveness was severely limited.</p>

<p>Not so today. Mobile devices allow a new generation of road warriors instant access to the home office, no matter where they may roam. The modern road warrior works at the airport, in hotel rooms, and in coffee shops. The office remains a central location for data and information, but your employees no longer need to be physically present.</p>

<h2>Gadgets and Gizmos</h2>

<p>The road warrior travels with a small arsenal of electronics. Notebooks, once the weapon of choice for on-the-road work, now face stiff competition from smaller, more easily transportable tablets. 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/is-todays-biggest-security-threat-hiding-in-your-pocket-2.html">Smartphones</a> have become so commonplace they hardly count as road warrior equipment any more, although a true veteran of the road would just as soon leave home without pants than without his phone.</p>

<p>Backing up the powerful tablet/smartphone combination are a host of electronic peripherals designed to make the road warriors life easier and more productive. Here are a few popular choices our tech associates couldnt live without:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Portable mouse</strong>: Touch screens are wonderful and notebook touchpads are functional, but sometimes you need the feel of a good-old-fashioned mouse. A small travel mouse with a USB receiver lets you move your cursor without taking up much room in your carry-on luggage.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Noise-Canceling Headphones</strong>: coffee shops, airports, and airplanes (especially airplanes) are loud, distracting environments. Noise-canceling headphones allow you to stay focused on your work, or simply chill out with some tunes without the constant whine of the airplane engine (or the five-year-old in the seat behind you).</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Pocket Projectors</strong>: while tablets are great for one-on-one presentations, pocket projectors allow you to make presentations to a full boardroom. Most miniprojectors have long-lasting batteries, hold several GB of data, offer Wi-Fi capabilities, and yes, fit in your pocket.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Portable Battery Packs: </strong>Power outlets are like police, taxis, and jelly-filled doughnuts  they're never around when you need them. Universal battery packs contain enough power to run a laptop for several hours. Some models include USB ports to charge small devices, and most weigh in at under a pound.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Mini-scanners: </strong>small enough to slip into a wallet, a mini-scanner lets you scan and organize the many business cards and expense receipts you collect on a road trip. Plus, theres a certain flair that comes with pulling a scanner out of your pocket that says, Yeah, I'm a real road warrior.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Smart Pens: </strong>for those meetings when you dont need a laptop, smart pens allow you to take notes and make audio recordings. Smart-pen software can create PDFs of your notes and translate handwriting into typed text.
<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Security on the Road</h2>

<p>Road warriors, and the companies they work for, have to consider security on the road. Laptops, tablets, and smartphones attract thieves, both for the physical device and the information stored within it. Wireless networks allow for on-the-go access, but theyre also vulnerable to hackers.</p>

<p>The canny road warrior takes precautions with mobile devices. Thanks to cloud computing, travelers dont need to store sensitive data directly on electronic devices; instead, they travel with as little as possible on their hard drives and download important files at their destination.</p>

<p>Despite all precautions, sometimes devices containing sensitive information do go missing. Tracking services can help recover stolen laptops and other devices, and even allow for remote device wiping (think of it as a kill switch for errant electronics).</p>

<p>If youre using Wi-Fi at an airport or other public venue, make sure you connect to the right Wi-Fi. Hackers sometimes set up fake Wi-Fi networks and record everything that passes through the network. The names of these fake networks usually look similar to the legitimate network, so check all connection names carefully.</p>

<h2>Working with a Mobile Workforce</h2>

<p>A traveling, telecommuting workforce brings many advantages to businesses. Road warriors can greatly increase a businesss range while remaining productive team members. The company that hires telecommuters needs less office space and saves on utility costs. Telecommuters and road warriors usually provide their own computers and portable devices, which saves the company equipment costs.</p>

<p>A remote workforce requires some special considerations and company policies. Employers may find it difficult, although not impossible, to track remote employee work hours. As a rule, productivity is deemed more important than regular hours with both road warriors and telecommuters. If the job gets done, and gets done well, it doesnt really matter if the employee prefers to work odd hours.</p>

<p>Employers should develop clear, specific mobile-security policies for their road warriors. Without a well-thought-out security plan, multiple portable devices connecting to the office network through public Wi-Fi connections is an IT nightmare just waiting to happen. A stolen laptop filled with sensitive business and client information could spell disaster for a small company.</p>

<p>Road warriors are, largely, an independent-minded bunch, but they should still have to conform when it comes to company security policies. At the very least, your company needs to insist that all portable devices used by road warriors support remote data wipes and strong security passwords.</p>

<p>Employers should maintain a list of all devices a road warrior uses to connect to the home network. When an employee leaves the company, access to the network needs to be revoked immediately. A disgruntled ex-employee with access to your data systems can wreck havoc on your network. Beat them to the punch: define your 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/do-this-now-define-your-mobile-security-policy.html">small-business mobile-security policy today</a>.</p>

<h2>Road Warrior Revolution</h2>

<p>Mobile devices may cause some headaches in the IT department, but the road warrior brings too many advantages to ignore. The ability to instantly communicate with the home office, access files from cloud storage, and deliver high-quality multimedia presentations to remote clients make road warriors a powerful business force. Long may they roam.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Passwords remain one of the best ways to secure accounts and computers. Unfortunately, many people make terrible password choices.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<em>Update on 1/16/13: A new list of the worst password choices is out! Read our article on the 
<a title="worst passwords 2012" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-most-unsafe-passwords-of-2012-look-like-the-ones-from-2011.html-2011.html">top 10 worst computer passwords in 2012</a> to find out what they are (and don't use them!).</em></p>

<p>Lets be brutally, painfully honest: Americans dont do a very good job when it comes to creating security passwords. Dont try to deny it  the facts prevent any argument on this matter. Our nations most common password is password1, and has been for years.</p>

<h2>Terrible, Terrible Computer Passwords</h2>

<p>Sophisticated password-cracking software programs run possible password combinations through multiple dictionaries, different languages, and even Wikipedia in the time it takes you to finish a cup of coffee. Before it hits the dictionary, however, any half-decent password cracker or 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/new-malware-threats-take-shape-in-2012-3.html">invasive malware</a> program runs through a list of commonly used passwords. And guess what? That list remains embarrassingly consistent.</p>

<p>Every year computer watchdogs publish Worst Passwords of the Year lists, and every year the same sad, overused passwords crop up. Popular choices include:</p>

<ul>

<li>password</li>

<li>qwerty</li>

<li>abc123</li>

<li>letmein</li>

<li>Iloveyou</li>

<li>Passw0rd</li>

<li>111111</li>

<li>123123</li>

<li>123456</li>

<li>654321</li>

<li>1234567</li>

<li>12345678</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use any of these passwords, dont waste time defending your actions. Dont hang your head in shame. Get to your account right now and change the password to something -- anything  that isnt on this list. Well still be here when you get back.</p>

<h2>Nu3b3r5 and Pa55w0rd5</h2>

<p>Popular wisdom recommends strengthening a password by adding numbers to it. While it's true a mix of letters and numbers provides greater security than letters alone, how we add numbers often defeats the purpose.</p>

<p>Look at the subheading for this section. Did you have any trouble reading it? Probably not, and neither would password-cracking software. People substitute numbers for letters in a predictable fashion: I and l become 1, S becomes 5, E turns into 3, and of course, o becomes 0. Children's activity books contain more complicated puzzle codes.</p>

<p>The practice of substituting numbers for letters in a password is so common that many password-cracking tools hunt for numerical alterations before they even start a dictionary check.</p>

<p>People sometimes add their birth year to the end of a password. On the surface, this seems reasonable: Youve added numbers to your password, and youre unlikely to forget your date of birth.</p>

<p>Trouble is, you havent added any real security. Once cracking software realizes that the first two digits are 19, it becomes obvious the last four spaces of your password are a year. Including any personal information in a password only increases your vulnerability to identity theft.</p>

<h2>Building a Better Computer Password</h2>

<p>Adding numbers to a password does increase security, as long as the numbers appear random. Adding symbols, uppercase letters, spaces, and grammar also strengthens passwords.</p>

<p>Your password should make sense to you, but appear random to others. One option is to start with a favorite song or movie quote. For instance, take this line from 
<em>America</em>: My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty. Of thee I sing.</p>

<p>Take the first letter from each word in the line and you have mctotslolotis. By itself, thats a strong password: its over 12 characters long, easy to remember if you know the song, and apparently random. To make it stronger, substitute some numbers, symbols, and uppercase letters. You might wind up with something like: mCt0t^s1O1^0tis.</p>

<p>Over time, a password cracker could still decipher this apparent gibberish, but like many criminals, hackers and 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-last-antivirus-advice-column-youll-ever-need.html">software viruses</a> prefer soft targets. With so many 12345 and qwerty passwords out there, why spend time hacking a complex password?</p>

<h2>Password Management Systems</h2>

<p>Ideally, you need a separate password for every online account. In practice, few of us possess the memory to remember more than a couple of complex passwords. Encrypted password management software remembers your passwords for you. Just make sure that you choose a reputable, well-written program.</p>

<title>Panic Button: Find My Stolen Laptop!</title>

<blockquote>
<p>The information on a stolen laptop can cripple a company and leave clients open to identity theft. Here's how to keep your data secure and, hopefully, get your laptop back.</p></blockquote>

<p>The phone call comes in the middle of the night. Your employee is frantic. One of your company laptops, chock-full of business secrets, was stolen at the airport.</p>

<p>If your companys 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/do-this-now-define-your-mobile-security-policy.html">security policies</a> dont cover mobile devices, youre in serious trouble, especially if you run a smaller shop. Large, well-funded companies can absorb the damage caused by a data breach. In comparison, a small company may not survive the havoc of a serious information breach. So how do you prevent data breaches and recover your stolen devices?</p>

<h2>Prevention and Paranoia</h2>

<p>When it comes to laptop safety, a little paranoia goes a long way. Laptop theft can occur in any setting, but it is especially common in busy public places such as airports, coffee shops, and college campuses.</p>

<p>It may be tempting to leave your laptop on a table or by your luggage for a few seconds while you order another coffee or check flight departures, but it only takes a few seconds for your laptop to go missing. Take it everywhere with you in public, up to and including the washroom.</p>

<h2>Password Policies</h2>

<p>You can replace a laptop. The information it contains, however, is often invaluable, so a strong mobile security policy needs to minimize data loss.</p>

<p>All laptops should be password protected. A strong login password doesnt provide impenetrable security  sophisticated hackers can use tools to bypass the password altogetherbut it at least slows the thief down.</p>

<p>A BIOS, or boot password, provides more efficient security. Boot passwords allow only three password attempts, after which the thief has to restart the computer for three more tries.</p>

<p>Thieves can circumvent a BIOS password by physically removing part of the motherboard (which sometimes wipes BIOS information) or shorting out the system to reset the BIOS. Both options involve physically opening the computer and poking at its insides with a screwdriver. This requires time and skill the thief may not possess, and if youre lucky, could also result in a nasty electric shock. (He stole your laptop. Let him fry his fingers.)</p>

<p>Another simple option is to restrict the amount of sensitive information on the hard drive. With 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/cloud-services-advanced/checklist-the-types-of-business-services-that-work-well-within-the-cloud.html">cloud storage services</a> readily available, you can travel with the bare minimum of data on your laptop and simply download any files you need to work with. Just make sure your employees know not to use automatic login settings for your cloud account.</p>

<h2>Laptop Recovery Tools</h2>

<p>Some antitheft devices for laptops include motion sensors. If the sensors determine the laptop is out of a predetermined work zone, the device prevents unauthorized users from booting up the laptop. Such devices also have the option of a loud alarm, drawing attention to the thief.</p>

<p>Tracking programs assist in laptop recovery and come with reasonable subscription rates. The laptop sends a location signal to the tracking company every time the device connects to the Internet. The laptop signal includes IP addresses, phone numbers used to connect to the Internet, service providers, and even GPS coordinates. The tracking company then turns the information over to the police. Some tracking systems also allow remote data removal.</p>

<p>A thief could wipe a hard drive to remove tracking software. Embedding a tracking device directly into a laptops motherboard eliminates the thiefs ability to simply delete security software.</p>

<h2>Basic Recovery Strategies</h2>

<p>With all the high-tech laptop solutions available today, you might neglect some effective, but down-to-earth, strategies. Record the serial numbers, model, and make of all company laptops and mobile devices. This gives you a way to confirm ownership, and gives the police much more to go on than, My laptop went missing  its black with a silver trim.</p>

<p>Laptop-recovery companies sometimes offer engraved plates that you affix to the laptop. The plate includes an identification number and an 800 number. If an honest soul finds your laptop, he or she can call the number and provide the recovery company with the identification code.</p>

<title>Microsoft's New Tablet Surfaces In Two Forms</title>
<description>Microsoft entered the tablet market by announcing the Surface tablet. Built directly by Microsoft and running Windows 8, will the Surface be able to go screen-to-screen against the iPad?</description>

<![CDATA[
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft entered the tablet market by announcing the Surface tablet. Built directly by Microsoft and running Windows 8, will the Surface be able to go screen-to-screen against the iPad?</p></blockquote>

<p>On June 18, 2012, Microsoft revealed it would be making its own tablet, the Surface. Actually, the company announced two tablets, the Surface RT, which should launch alongside Windows 8 this fall, and a beefed-up version called Surface Pro that will hit the market a few months after that.</p>

<p>The announcement didnt exactly floor industry analysts, many of whom expressed doubt about Microsoft's ability to compete with Apple's established iPad but it did raise a few eyebrows. Microsoft traditionally collaborates with hardware companies such as Dell and Lenovo; Microsoft provides the operating system, and the hardware firm makes the actual device. While hardware partners are, apparently, still going to produce Windows 8 tablets, with the Surface, Microsoft announced its intention to compete directly in the tablet market.</p>

<p>From a consumer point of view, there's plenty to like in the Surface's features, but will the new tablet be able to carve itself a niche in a crowded tablet market?</p>

<h2>Surface Stats</h2>

<p>It must be admitted: Both the Surface RT and Surface Pro are well-designed little tablets with some intriguing features. The case is made of rigid, durable magnesium, and the 10.6-inch screen is designed for widescreen movie viewing.</p>

<p>The back of the Surface includes a built-in kickstand for desktop use, but the real selling point may be the front cover. Attached by magnetic clasps, the cover folds down to reveal a keyboard. Typing on touchscreens has always been difficult. By including a kickstand and keyboard, Microsoft suggests that Surface is a tablet that can finally act as a productive business tool.</p>

<p>Two possible keyboard covers are offered. One is a multi-touch keyboard and track pad, while the other is a thin keyboard with real keys. For touch typists, the lack of a touchpad is a small price to pay for real, tactile keys.</p>

<p>The Surface also includes two USB ports, a feature that is not included on the industry-leading iPad. The RT USB ports are 2.0, while the Pro's ports are 3.0. Connecting your tablet to a USB storage device, portable mouse, or printer will be as easy as plugging them into the Surface, presuming the device is compatible with the Surface RT's ARM processor. The tablet wont support some older "legacy" devices, raising the possibility that Microsoft plans a line of ARM-compatible products.</p>

<h2>RT or Pro?</h2>

<p>The Surface RT seems to be designed with the consumer in mind: a battery-sipping ARM processor powers Windows RT, and Microsoft Office comes preinstalled. Word, PowerPoint, Excel and OneNote are included with the Windows RT operating system,. The tablet includes 32 to 64 GB of internal memory.</p>

<p>Despite these strengths, Surface RT tablets won't support all legacy printers, scanners, and other devices, so the RT model isnt as business-friendly as Surface Pro.</p>

<p>The Surface Pro, in contrast, runs on an Intel processor, supports both Windows 8 and legacy applications, and offers 63 to 128 GB of memory. In terms of power and capabilities, the Surface Pro resembles an ultrathin laptop more than a tablet. For business use, the Pro is fully compatible with existing Windows systems, which may please IT departments dealing with the chaos of Bring Your Own Device policies.</p>

<h2>Price Considerations</h2>

<p>The Surface looks like a handy little tablet, and the built-in keyboard and kickstand certainly address the problem of touchscreen typing. This does, indeed, look like a tablet that could be used for work as well as play. The question, of course, is will consumers buy the new device?</p>

<p>To answer that question, we really need to know what type of price Microsoft plans for their new tablets. During the launch presentation, company executives wouldnt commit to a definite price, saying only that the Surface's price would be competitive.</p>

<p>This raises a fairly obvious question: competitive to what? The surface RT could be priced similarly to the iPad, which runs between $400 to $700, depending on features. The Surface Pro functions more like an ultrabook, which are generally priced $800 and up.</p>

<p>Will people be willing to pay the same price for the unproven Surface that they currently pay for the well-established (and well-loved) iPad? Or does "competitive pricing" refer to the much cheaper Android tablets, which average in cost around $300? That seems too low a price for the Surface's features.</p>

<p>The answer may lie somewhere in the middle: more expensive than the Android, but offering enough savings to tempt users away from the iPad. Only Microsoft knows, and they're not saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Windows RT stands out among the different versions of Windows 8. Designed specifically for tablets and mobile devices, RT has the industry buzzing with excitement.</p></blockquote>

<p>Microsoft announced in May 2012 that users would be able to choose from three distinct versions of Windows 8. This development was hardly unexpected: The company usually releases multiple versions of its operating systems.</p>

<p>The first two versions follow Microsofts usual logic: Windows 8 is the basic version of the operating system, and the one most desktop computers are likely to use. Windows 8 Pro offers some advanced features for IT departments and computer enthusiasts to explore. Again, no real change from previous iterations of Windows.</p>

<p>The third choice, Windows RT, is unlike anything Windows has previously offered. Designed specifically for tablet and mobile devices running on ARM processors, Windows RT isnt available as an upgrade. Instead, the operating system comes preinstalled on mobile devices. This in itself is a major departure for Microsoft. New versions of Windows, including Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro, have always been upgrades of the preceding operating system. Windows RT is something entirely new and exciting.</p>

<h2>The First Real Windows for Tablets</h2>

<p>Desktop editions of Windows 8 have two separate interfaces: the Start Screen, where you can access Metro apps, and the traditional Desktop, which you use to run Microsoft Office and other pre-Windows 8 software. Windows RT dispenses with this cumbersome setup by only using the Metro Start Screen. However, heres the game changer: RT comes bundled with Microsoft Office. Microsoft has always sold Office separately from its operating systems, and still does so with Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro. Not so with RT.</p>

<p>This shift, coupled with only selling RT as a preinstalled device on new tablets, reflects the larger mobile-market focus on integration and bundled packages. Preinstalling RT and Office on new tablets provides out-of-the-box functionality and translates directly into savings for the consumer, both because you wont need to purchase Microsoft Office and RT-based tablets need attractive pricing to compete with the iPad and other established tablets.</p>

<p>Microsoft designed RT to provide the maximum possible battery life for tablets. In addition to the obvious advantage of more on-screen time before needing to recharge, extended battery life also encourages lighter, thinner tablet designs.</p>

<h2>IT and Windows RT</h2>

<p>IT departments have a love-hate relationship with mobile devices. On the one hand, the versatility of portable devices cannot be denied. On the other hand, companies prefer to centrally manage their devices and IT departments need to be able to use a standard set of network access controls. The mish-mash of portable devices currently in use makes IT staff tear their hair out in frustration. Windows RT, like other versions of Windows, can be centrally managed, which makes RT devices much more attractive to IT departments.</p>

<p>If you're a consumer, that may not seem like a big deal, but it actually has a significant impact on your devices security. Microsofts primary audience for the past few years has been businesses and IT departments. Because of this focus, Microsoft developed a robust response to security issues that their competitors lack, to the point where security expert Eugene Kaspersky estimates Apples security capabilities are up to a decade behind Microsofts.</p>

<p>Windows RT represents Microsofts determination to carve out a space in the lucrative tablet market. Early indications suggest that the RT is going to be a game changer on multiple levels.</p>

<p>Todays businesses wont get far with dial-up Internet and a couple of old computers. Learn what you need to do business in the new millennium.</p></blockquote>

<p>Setting up a small business is a time-consuming task, even if its a labor of love. With so much to do, you want to focus on your product or service, not on the kinds of computing tools youll need. Still, the modern company cant do much without the latest technology.</p>

<p>Here, to your rescue, is this handy guide. Use it to outfit your business with the technology and software you require to do business in the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/is-living-in-the-cloud-right-for-your-small-business.html">new millennium</a>.</p>

<h2>The Home Office</h2>

<p>Most businesses have a home base, whether its a central office used by you and your employees or a room in your home set up to run a one-person operation. Either way, a few basic tools are required:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Your computer(s). </strong>The computer station is the basic unit of productivity in most modern businesses, should you employ one person or 20. The rise in popularity of laptops has prompted some businesses to give each employee a laptop they can use both in the office and out. However, theres much to be said for the comfort and ease of use of large monitors and full keyboards. Consider a mix of mobile and stationary computers for your office setup. If you go with a more mobile route, be sure to

<strong></strong></li>

<li>
<strong>Your network.</strong> Youll want to tie your computer stations together into a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/extending-your-wireless-potential.html">network</a>, so everybody can communicate and have access to the necessary data. Smaller businesses might get away with a high-speed Internet connection and a router that gives you wireless connections and email options, but companies with lots of data or more employees will probably need a server or should investigate 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/what-is-nas-network-attached-storage.html">network attached storage (NAS)</a>. 
<strong></strong></li>

<li>
<strong>Your server.</strong> The server in a business acts as a central hub where your company website is housed, as well as the critical data needed to run your business. All communications among employees and between your business and your customers flow through the server. The server also lets employees on the road stay in touch and have access to data.
<strong></strong></li>

<li>
<strong>Your software.</strong> In addition to the software necessary for business tasks like word processing and accounting, youll need applications that will keep your network safe. Antivirus packages for computer stations are a must-have, as are firewalls and permissions software that guard entrance to your server. Not everyone needs the same access to your server as you, and these tools will allow you to specify who gets in and who doesnt. (

</ul>

<h2>Going Mobile</h2>

<p>More and more, companies are doing business away from the home office as employees travel and work from home. A few tools have made such mobility easier than ever.</p>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">Using your own device in the office is now a widely accepted practice, but are you keeping the network protected?</span></p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">Most of us understand the premise behind BYOB. It's a party thing. But what about BYOD?</span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;"> </span></p>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">Here's a hint: It has nothing to do with booze and everything to do with all the personal mobile devices your small workforce is bringing into the office. Shorthand for bring your own devices, the term is fast becoming standard for discussions about security policies and consumer technology.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">Those are discussions worth having, too. Because office workers use their devices to access multiple networks when theyre off the clock, they could be introducing security threats to your workplace. Here are some ways to make sure your company data is safe, even in a BYOD environment. </span></p>

<h2>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">Develop a Mobile Security Disaster Plan</span></h2>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">In a recent study from router firm Juniper Networks, device users had a wide array of opinions about security responsibility. Some thought the service provider should be held accountable for security, while others pointed to the device manufacturer or software security provider.</span>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;"> </span></p>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">Take a moment to ask yourself: If a security issue crops up in an employee-owned device, who would be held responsible? Create a disaster plan that includes tech-support numbers and other contacts so you can get the situation resolved quickly.</span></p>

<h2>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">Write Up a Mobile Security Policy </span></h2>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">Even in a small office with just a few employees, a well-stated security policy can be crucial for clarifying BYOD rules. </span></p>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">These policies usually state that all data on the device must be encrypted, applications that would compromise network security cant be installed and devices must be configured with strong and frequently changed passwords. Security requirements might include:</span></p>

<ul>

<li>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: small;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: xx-small;">      </span></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">Company permission to remotely wipe the device if its lost or stolen, or if the employee leaves the company</span></li>

<li>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: small;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: xx-small;">      </span></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">Audits of the device to make sure its in compliance with security protocols</span></li>

<li>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: small;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: xx-small;">      </span></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">Bans on specific applications that have been known to contain security risks</span></li>

<li>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: small;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: xx-small;">      </span></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">Prohibition of corporate data storage on the device, or access to cloud services where company data resides</span></li>

<li>
<span style="color: black; font-family: Symbol; font-size: small;">
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: xx-small;">      </span></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">Clearly communicate to employees that they are prohibited from storing their passwords and login IDs on their mobile devices. As we know from experience, the biggest security threat to a small business is often hiding in peoples pockets.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">Segment the Network</span></h2>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">Some companies boost protection by splitting up the enterprise network and creating an access area thats only for devices. This limits employees chances of putting the company network at risk because they stay out of areas with sensitive data. The tactic works especially well if the user only needs Internet access and doesnt have to tap into company information. </span></p>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">If employees do need to dive into business data or applications, you can set up a virtual private network that operates within the BYOD network space. This strategy is handy for reducing the chance of introducing viruses to the network as well.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">For a handy infographic of current virus threats and definitions, </span>

<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;"> </span></p>

<p>
<span style="color: black; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; font-size: small;">If your workplace is becoming a BYOD environment, take the time to employ these simple tactics. Itll be well worth the effort to lock down and prevent data thieves from getting into your network (for additional security policy advice, read our article on </span>

<title>Processors 101: Understanding ARM and Windows RT</title>

<blockquote>
<p>With the announcement of Microsoft's Windows RT tablet, ARM processors are very much in the news. What exactly is an ARM processor, and why is it important?</p></blockquote>

<p>With Windows RT set to launch in September, coupled with the Surface tablet Microsoft announced in June, ARM processors have become a hot topic.</p>

<p>Surface tablets, come in two forms: Surface RT (the RT stands for Run Time) will use an Nvidia ARM processor, while the slightly larger but more powerful Surface Pro will run on an Intel's third-generation Core i5 CPU..</p>

<p>None of this, of course, answers two very basic questions users are asking: What the heck is an ARM processor and why should I care?</p>

<h2>Understanding ARM Processors</h2>

<p>ARM processors have a history that dates back to the 1980s, when Acorn Computers designed the original architecture. Acorn since developed into ARM Holdings, which licenses the processor to manufacturers. ARM stands for 
<strong>A</strong>dvanced
<strong> R</strong>ISC (reduced instruction set computer) 
<strong>M</strong>achine, which again tells the average person absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>All you really need to know is that an ARM processor is small, relatively cheap to produce and has a low power usage. These three attributes make ARM processors well suited to mobile devices. If you own a smartphone, portable game console, netbook or MP3 player, chances are it runs on an ARM processor.</p>

<p>When used in tablets, ARM processors provide longer battery life because they use less power. ARM processors also produce less heat than larger Intel processors, so the tablet casing can be thinner. And while they are not as fast as Intel PC or notebook processors, ARM processors still provide reasonable speed, especially when it comes to mobile computing tasks.</p>

<h2>ARM, Intel Core and Legacy Application Compatibility</h2>

<p>The ARM processor does have some disadvantages compared to an Intel processor. Avoiding a long, complicated, and unbelievably boring explanation, ARM processors are not compatible with applications designed for programs written with Intel's x86 architecture. That includes all versions of Windows before Windows RT.</p>

<p>In other words, if you own a large library of pre-Windows 8 applications, such as games, image-editing software packages with cameras and camcorders, and drivers for older printers and other electronic devices, dont expect to run them on Surface RT Microsoft had to make some significant tweaks just to Windows and Office to make RT compatible with ARM processors.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that the Surface tablets are standalone products like ereaders. The tablets will be compatible with any portable device that runs on an ARM processor, so you'll be able to connect it to business card scanners, cell phones and similar devices. Newer model wireless printers and peripherals should be ARM-compatible, not because of Surface, but simply because of the prevalence of ARM-powered portable devices now available.</p>

<p>This explains why Microsoft decided to develop two versions of the Surface tablet. If you're looking for a light tablet with long battery life, and you dont mind starting your app collection from scratch, look to the 9.3 mm, 23.85 ounce Surface RT. Running off Windows RT, the Surface RT will run all apps found in the Windows Store, which will replace legacy applications. You'll be able to do any task you use legacy apps for, you'll just be using applications designed for Windows RT and the ARM processor.</p>

<p>If, however, you want laptop-levels of power, connectivity to legacy devices, and a processor capable of running legacy apps, the 13.5 mm, 31.85 ounce Surface Pro may be more appropriate for your needs.</p>

<p>While some critics have suggested Microsoft needlessly complicates the Surface tablets by offering two versions, the company may be looking to kill two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>The Surface RT tablet can compete with other ARM-based mobile devices and that giant of the tablet industry, the iPad. These devices are best suited for web-surfing, movie-watching, games and other types of content viewing, although the Surface RT's integrated keyboard gives the tablet an edge over the iPad for word processing and email composition</p>

<p>The Surface Pro, with its legacy app support and larger memory, is more of a productivity tablet, designed to compete with ultrabooks and the laptop market. It offers more power and can connect to existing office equipment while retaining the portability of a tablet.</p>

<p>This isn't a new strategy for Microsoft, which has long made a practice of offering different versions of Windows to consumers and the business world. What is new is Microsoft's decision to compete with its hardware partners by producing its own product using both ARM and x86. This reflects the computer industry's increasing awareness that consumers and businesses use different hardware to consume different content.</p>

<p>People want hardware that provides them with what they need, when they need it. What's powering the device is, for most people, a secondary consideration.</p>

<title>A Look at the Verizon 2012 Data Breach Report </title>
<description>Cybercriminals are more active than ever, especially the hacktivists. Will LulzSec target you?</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Cybercriminals are more active than ever, especially the hacktivists. Will LulzSec target you?</p></blockquote>

<p>No bones about it  2011 was a year of ominous Internet troubles. Over that period, a whopping 174 million Web-based records were compromised or left open to theft by 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/what-is-keylogging.html">cybercriminals</a>.</p>

<p>Last year was also dominated by talk of hacktivist groups like Anonymous and LulzSec that caused widespread mayhem by illegally accessing the servers of corporations and organizations to steal information. Last year, 100 million people were affected by these groups, whose aims are often as shadowy and frightening as the people behind them.</p>

<p>Clearly, the hactivists have the capability to put us all at risk, and not even the FBI is immune to their threats. But are Anonymous and LulzSec the biggest danger to Internet security? According to the comprehensive 
<em>
<a href="http://www.verizonbusiness.com/about/events/2012dbir/index.xml">Verizon 2012 Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, </em>perhaps not.</p>

<h2>Tracking Computing Threats</h2>

<p>Each year since 2004, the Verizon RISK team has gotten together with the international law-enforcement community to asses trends in cybercrime. These folks count the number of records breached each year, determine who is behind the breaches, and provide recommendations as to how they can be stopped.</p>

<p>The big story from Verizon this year was the rise of hacktivists. These groups  who have hacked into organizations like Sony Pictures, the Recording Industry Association of America, and the FBI  are often motivated by political dissatisfaction, stealing records as a way of voicing dissent. Sometimes though, their only aim appears to be getting their lulz, or having a bit of fun (lulz is related to the Internet saying LOL, or laughing out loud).</p>

<p>In 2011, in terms of the number of records stolen, these groups took the cake, thieving more than twice that of other hackers. However, when counting the total number of cases of data theft, organized criminals out for financial gain committed 86 percent of all crimes. In other words, the hacktivist movement stole a lot but in a limited number of actions.</p>

<h2>As Always, Money Makes It Happen</h2>

<p>What the Verizon report tells us is that in the vast majority of data breaches, plain old greed is the principal motivating factor. Ninety-six percent of all breaches were done to steal information the criminals could use to line their pockets. Credit card information and sensitive personal data were the targets of these folks.</p>

<p>The other point the report makes clear is that criminals almost always target the most vulnerable  those businesses whose Internet security, or lack thereof, makes them easy pickings. It isnt surprising then that the Verizon report states small businesses and those without dedicated IT teams constitute the largest group of victims.</p>

<p>In contrast, since hactivists want attention for their misdeeds, they target large groups, using their expertise to break into sophisticated systems as a point of pride. Also, since money isnt their primary aim, theyre likely to steal noncritical data  names and email addresses  just to make their point.</p>

<h2>Stopping Computer Data Breaches</h2>

<p>Most cybercriminals want money, but they dont want to get caught. This simple algorithm explains why the bad guys go for the soft targets  businesses that make it easy for the hackers to steal from them.</p>

<p>The good news is that by putting into practice a few 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/my-pc-is-a-fortress-four-steps-you-can-take-to-assess-and-secure-your-office-pc.html">computer security measures</a>, most businesses can discourage criminal activity. Ninety-seven percent of all breaches last year could have been prevented through simple or intermediate controls.</p>

<p>Yes, breaches can be stopped. Be prepared. Dont give the data thieves their lulz.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Need to resize or remove an app from the Windows 8 Start screen? Here's how to do it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Youre unlikely to use every app that comes preinstalled with Windows 8.  Some app tiles are twice as large as others, which is great if its an app you use all the time, but large app tiles also eat up space on the screen.</p>

<p>If you want to shrink a large app tile down to size, right-click the tile and select Small from the option list. This cuts the tile down to normal size. On the other hand, if you don't want to see the app on the Start screen at all, select Unpin from Start. The app is still available if you need it, but no longer displayed on the Start screen.</p>

<p>Or, if you just want to get rid of an app, right-click its tile and select Uninstall.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft rewrites the book with Windows 8, changing many of the features users expect in an operating system. Here are a few tips to help you find your way through the new interface.</p></blockquote>

<p>The thunder you hear in the distance is the rapidly approaching Windows 8 launch date, slated for October 26. The new Windows operating system marks a real departure from Microsofts old Desktop format, focusing instead on completely new, touch-friendly Windows 8 applications, which are smartphone-like apps that provide specific information and functions.</p>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<p>The apps are the most obvious new feature of Windows 8, and reflect Microsofts decision to create an operating system for touch-screen tablets, smartphones, PCs and laptops. On a tablet, youll open, close and move apps with finger swipes. PC and laptop users can still navigate with a keyboard and mouse.</p>

<p>Windows 8 is loaded with new security features, including a picture-based log-in. The user draws a prearranged group of dots over an image to log in. Regular log-ins with passwords are, of course, still supported. The new operating system also comes with a complete antivirus program built into Windows Security Essentials, a move designed to make it easier to keep your machines virus-free.</p>

<h2>Mastering Windows 8 Apps</h2>

<p>These tile-based, touch-friendly apps are at the core of Windows 8, and youll need to learn how to use them. Here are a few pointers:</p>

<ul>

<li>Apps run full-screen, but you can view two side-by-side by dragging an active app to one side of the screen. The app now displays as a sidebar and you can open a second app.</li>

<li>If you want to close an app, hover the mouse pointer over the left side of the screen. A Charm menu will appear with a list of open apps. Right-click the app you want and select 
<strong>Close</strong>.</li>

<li>You can organize apps into groups by dragging any app to an empty space on the Start screen. This creates a new group and you can drag and drop app tiles into the group.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Know When to Use the Desktop</h2>

<p>These new apps offer all kinds of functionality, but sometimes you still need to access the traditional Desktop. Programs such as the Microsoft Office suite run on the Desktop, and youll find a Desktop link in the Metro app tiles.</p>

<p>Windows 8 also comes with two versions of Internet Explorer. Click the IE Metro app and you get a browser that runs entirely on HTML5 and doesnt support Flash or website plug-ins. This version of IE conserves battery life and offers greater security. Flash has seen its fair share of security exploits and energy consumption issues in the recent past and many large companies, like Microsoft and Apple Inc., are no longer including the software as part of their default OS offering. If you need a browser that supports plug-ins, open Internet Explorer through the Desktop.</p>

<h2>Discover the Hidden Tools</h2>

<p>Microsoft keeps the Start screen uncluttered by hiding option buttons and tools in Charm menus, which only appear when you hover the mouse pointer over them. This has led some people to incorrectly assume that Windows 8 doesnt come with a Power Off option.</p>

<p>Here's a quick breakdown of the Start screens hidden functions:</p>

<ul>

<li>The Charm menu on the right side of the screen includes 
<strong>Search</strong>, 
<strong>Start</strong>, 
<strong>Share</strong>, 
<strong>Device</strong> and 
<strong>Settings</strong> options. The 
<strong>Shut Down </strong>option is in 
<strong>Settings</strong> under 
<strong>Power</strong>.</li>

<li>The left-hand Charm lists all active apps.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Cyberespionage has been an unpleasant fact for decades. Could the virtual tools of high-tech international espionage one day target your home business?</p></blockquote>

<p>In May 2012, Russian-based antivirus company Kaspersky Lab discovered a malware program they dubbed Flame. Designed for attacks using a complex system of modular components, Flame primarily targets business computers and government organizations in Middle Eastern nations, most notably Iran, Hungary, Lebanon and Palestine. The geographic location of Flame-infected computers, coupled with the sophisticated nature of the malware, suggests that Flame is the work of a nation-state engaging in cyberespionage and possible cybersabotage.</p>

<p>A number of features within the 
<a title="EasyTech Explains Computer Malware" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/easytech-explains-the-nasty-viruses-threatening-pcs-today.html">malware</a> code suggest that Flame's creators carefully controlled the spread of the program, but small businesses should still take note. Could similar programs lurk in your network, quietly stealing your data?</p>

<h2>Multi-Pronged Attack Modules</h2>

<p>Flame enters Windows OS networks through infected USB thumb drives, shared printer spool vulnerabilities and network shares. The initial point of infection remains a mystery, although the primary suspects are spear-phishing emails targeting unknown Windows vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Initial infections only install Flame's main component programming. The malware's controllers then add modules to the main component to customize the malware attack. Thus far, researchers have identified 20 separate modules.</p>

<p>Among other abilities, Flame can record audio conversations, take screenshots, log keyboard activity and snoop network traffic. Attackers can gather information about nearby discoverable 
<a title="Computer Malware threats in 2012" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/new-malware-threats-take-shape-in-2012-3.html">mobile Bluetooth devices</a> while also making infected computers Bluetooth discoverable.</p>

<h2>Running Silent and Evading Detection</h2>

<p>Flame evaded detection by multiple antiviral programs for at least two years, with some experts suggesting the program may have been in the wild since 2007. The malware creators clearly had stealth in mind.</p>

<p>In addition, Flame attackers can disable the malware's ability to spread, and included cleanup features capable of erasing all traces of Flame from an infected computer. Most malware includes some cleanup functionality to cover evidence left during installation, but Flame can completely remove itself.</p>

<h2>Are You at Risk of a Flame Malware attack?</h2>

<p>Producing a program capable of hiding as effectively as Flame requires more resources than most hackers could access. Flame is a multi-million dollar project, another sign that the malware originates with a nation-state or a state-contracted company.</p>

<p>Unless you deal with sensitive government information, chances are you're safe from Flame or similar cyberespionage programs. Major antivirus programs can now identify and neutralize Flame.</p>

<p>The real danger to small businesses lies in the lessons hackers can learn from cyberespionage in general. An increase in stealthy malware capable of covering its own tracks is possible. Such malware could revolutionize corporate espionage or identity theft. While mostly a theoretical threat at present, the possibility of widespread cyberterrorism attacks on a nation's business environment must also be considered.</p>

<h2>Protecting Yourself against New Viruses</h2>

<p>An up-to-date 
<a title="Staples antivirus" href="http://www.staples.com/Antivirus-Internet-Security/cat_CL140492">antivirus program</a> remains an important aspect of network security, as does a regular schedule of updating and patching operating systems and other software. While effective against known viruses, however, these precautions are less effective against as-yet undiscovered threats.</p>

<p>Antivirus software is primarily reactive: Companies develop protection to new viruses as they emerge. That protects you against future attacks, but offers no security if you're one of the first victims of a previously unknown program.</p>

<p>Monitoring IT network data helps identify threats that operate under the antiviral industry's radar. Abnormal network activity may indicate a possible intrusion, and should be isolated as soon as possible. Monitoring data in this way requires a proactive, intensive approach to network security. A small business may need 
<a title="Talk to an EasyTech" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/talk-to-an-easytech/">expert IT services</a> to set up such as system. The extra effort could help avoid a targeted attack on vital business information.</p>

<p>No need to try fancy tricks for getting a faster connection  just try this quick tip.</p></blockquote>

<p>The days of putting foil on TV antennas may have passed, but lets face it: sometimes we yearn for the simplicity of that strategy. Fortunately, when it comes to wireless signals, theres no need to break out the food wrap.</p>

<p>Boosting a wireless signal can be as easy as changing the channel (and nope, not on the TV). Every router has 11 wireless channels, and most people use the default setting. But if your connection seems slower than it should be, playing around with channel options could be a route to better speed.</p>

<p>Specifics on channel-changing depend on the router manufacturer. Fortunately, many manufacturers have put helpful, step-by-step information online. For example, 
<a href="http://en-us-support.belkin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1567/kw/change%20ssid/session/L3RpbWUvMTM0NTE1MDUyNy9zaWQveHNPZ3ZTM2w%3D">Belkin offers this guide</a> for users who want to find a less crowded channel.</p>

<p>This strategy can be especially helpful if youve noticed your connection slows down during peak times  if youre home, those times could be early evenings and weekends. Thats an indication that a channel is busy because of multiple wireless networks. In that case, simply hop onto a different channel.</p>

<p>Sluggish, tired and lackluster: Do these words come to mind when you think of your wireless connection? If they do, its time to change the vocabulary.</p>

<p>A number of strategies can be beneficial for increasing wireless speed. Sometimes, however, all it takes is a simple one: moving your router.</p>

<p>Household appliances, office equipment and other wireless devices can all emit signals that interfere with a wireless router. Even a neighbor could be the source of trouble, if that person has a router thats close to yours.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Feeling sluggish? There is a number of reasons why a network connection can slow down. Here are some tips on getting speedy again.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your Internet service provider (ISP) may 
<em>offer</em> 20 Mbps of network zip. But the harsh truth is that consumers rarely receive exactly what they pay for when it comes to connection speed.</p>

<p>Nothing malicious is going on  its just the nature of connectivity. Plenty of factors can lead to temporary slowdowns, sluggish performance and even network downtime. Fortunately, you can count on proven strategies for boosting speed easily and quickly.</p>

<h2>Hitting the Slow Lane</h2>

<p>Connection speed can vary quite a bit, depending on the ISP. For example, if your ISP relies on a cable line, speed can be affected by the quality of the cable or how many users are sharing the connection. Slowdowns can also crop up due to problems with an ISPs fiber network.</p>

<p>The problem could be on your end, though. One of the most common causes of poor Internet speed is 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/easytech-exam-how-infected-computers-behave.html">spyware or virus infection</a>, which can make a PC seem sluggish in general. Other reasons might include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Faulty hardware that connects your PC to the wall</li>

<li>An older network interface card</li>

<li>A browser memory cache that hasnt been cleared in awhile</li>
</ul>

<p>Speed can even be affected if you have an open wireless network and others are hopping onto the connection.</p>

<h2>Speed Up Now</h2>

<p>Although some issues might be out of your control, there are also ways to switch to the fast lane.</p>

<p>First, contact your ISP and double-check what connection speed is supposed to be coming to your house or office. Then, do a 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/get-to-know-the-online-pc-speed-tests.html">quick test on a speed site</a> to determine if theres a discrepancy. If you find one, try these strategies to see if you can break the bottleneck:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Review the settings on your broadband router.</strong> Many times, an improperly configured router will cause performance issues. Make sure your routers settings are in line with the manufacturers recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Do an antivirus checkup.</strong> Worms, spyware, adware and viruses can significantly slow down a connection, often by running in the background without your knowledge. Clean out the bugs by doing frequent security scans.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Reduce the number of applications that run automatically.</strong> Any type of app that regularly uses the network to check email, to run peer-to-peer software or even to find the latest stock prices or sports scores can affect performance if used in conjunction with other apps.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Examine the network equipment.</strong> Cables, wires, modems and routers are just like any other type of product: they age and eventually fail. Test your equipment by rearranging cables and wires to see if it makes a difference. Sometimes, even reversing the cable that runs from a router to a modem can have an effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>After each tactic, run another online speed test  theyre quick and free, after all  to see if you might be getting closer to the high-speed connection that your ISP promises.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our experts help identify some effective ways for making your small-business network perform like an enterprise-class setup.</p></blockquote>

<p>Maybe you think enterprise-class network clout also comes with a corporation-sized bill, but dont worry: there are plenty of ways to make your network more efficient and speedy without spending a dime.</p>

<p>Better yet, these measures require only minimal IT savvy. All you need is a bit of technical know-how along with some time to change settings and play around with configurations. After all, you should be spending your days fueling your small business, not spinning your wheels on technology setups.</p>

<p>Heres a look at some common network issues and how to overcome them to make your network hum.</p>

<h2>Stay on Top of System Upgrades</h2>

<p>Software compatibility issues can slow down a business network or even bring it to a halt. However, theres a simple, no-cost way to prevent most of these problems: Don't ignore the upgrade notices.</p>

<p>Every system and program includes auto-upgrade tools that can detect potential security holes, compatibility problems and poor performance. These tools can also draw new code from the manufacturer to make your system efficient again.</p>

<p>
<em>Tactics:
</em></p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Upgrade when possible. </strong>Some employees or business owners might be too busy to follow up on upgrade notices. When the upgrades begin piling up, they will take longer to download. In the meantime, you could be at risk for viruses and spotty network speeds. Educate employees on the importance of doing updates, and dont skimp on them yourself.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Patch it up. </strong>If you're not sure what updates are available, and youre a Windows Server user, download Microsofts Windows Server Update Services patch management tool. Its free to licensed customers and helps you manage your updates and hotfixes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Get Virus-Resistant</h2>

<p>Nothing slows down a network faster than a virus. Fortunately, plenty of antivirus tools are available  some of which are even free.</p>

<p>
<em>Tactics:
</em></p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Look for extensive protection</strong>. This includes blocking malware in real time and updating automatically. At the very least, consider doing a virus scan so you can get an idea of whats on your network. Usually, youll find at least some adware (software that sends out ads, usually in the form of pop-ups). While adware is often harmless, it can still hurt network speed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Do your research. </strong>Some hackers love to create legitimate-looking antivirus tools that give them access to a users system. When youre comparing free tools, be sure to do extensive research on a company before downloading anything. Go with a familiar name if possible  most of the top security companies offer free security scan tools.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Act quickly if infected. </strong>If youre experiencing significant reduction in network connection speed, you may have already gotten socked by a virus. In that case, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/the-self-diagnosis-primer-2/tips-what-to-do-the-moment-after-expected-pc-virus-exposure.html">check out this article</a> on what to do in the moment after a suspected virus exposure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reduce Interference</h2>

<p>With wireless network equipment, interference can cause uneven connections and poor signal quality. Usually, in a small business or a home, people think its the Internet service provider having some type of issue. But more often, its a router problem  and one that may be easily fixed.</p>

<p>
<em>Tactics:
</em></p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Move your router. </strong>Surprisingly, even home appliances may affect a router's performance. But most often, the interference comes from other sources like cordless phones, baby monitors and wireless equipment from a nearby home or office. Try changing the location of the router to see if it speeds up network performance.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Change the routers channel. </strong>Interference can happen because too many devices are trying to operate on the same frequency. It's like multiple radio stations all attempting to play music over the same radio waves  theyll all have tunes come through, but the result is a mess.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Replace the routers antenna. </strong>While this strategy isnt free, there are many affordable options  especially compared with the cost of buying a new router. If the antenna is removable, you can upgrade to a high-gain version that focuses the wireless in just one direction. Most standard antennas are omnidirectional, which means that if a router is next to a wall, part of the signal is being wasted. A high-gain version will allow you to target the signal more effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prevent User-Created Bottlenecks</h2>

<p>When seeing bandwidth issues on the network, most people think of virus infection, but normal, legitimate user behavior can also bring a network to a crawl.</p>

<p>
<em>Tactics:
</em></p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Adhere to savvy email practices. </strong>If employees reply to emails that have files attached, and those replies contain the attachments, it wont be long before the conversational threads become a source for concern. Basically, every reply will be creating a duplicate file, and all of those will have to sit on your network. Ask employees to put files on a shared drive rather than emailing them as attachments.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Save wisely.</strong> Similar to multiple file creation on email, saving large files like PowerPoint presentations or videos can become a network issue if theyre duplicated and saved in several versions. This challenge has led many companies to begin storing their applications and data on a cloud-based solution to keep their local networks clear. Another option, which costs nothing, is simply to encourage better practices.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Do regular cleanup. </strong>Unless theres a compelling business reason, saving thousands of emails every year isnt necessary. Make it a practice to keep only those that are relevant to a certain project or service, and dont retain any follow-up emails of the got it, thanks! variety.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these low-tech, low-cost strategies will go a long way toward keeping your network cleaner, safer and more efficient. And who wouldnt feel like humming a happy tune with a faster and stronger network?</p>

<p>Avoid the common pitfalls of wireless network setup with these great tips.</p></blockquote>

<p>Setting up a wireless network shouldnt have to take more than an hour or two. The key is to avoid the most common pitfalls by committing a few good tips to memory. Or better yet, why not print them out?</p>

<p>Here are 10 essential tips to protect your sanity while setting up a wireless network worthy of your busy home office or small business.</p>

<h2>Tip #1: Wireless Router Location Counts</h2>

<p>Many people assume a wireless router can send its signals anywhere with ease. The truth is, walls and dense materials can kill a wireless signal in its tracks, leaving users without coverage in their own homes. One of the simplest ways to avoid this problem is to pick a good location for your router. Choose a spot close to the areas where you will most often need a signal  and far from obstacles and solid objects that might slow down all those bits and bytes.</p>

<h2>Tip #2: Reduce Wireless Interference</h2>

<p>Not everything that interferes with a wireless signal is made of brick or metal; radio signals from other devices can spoil the job just as well. Many of the electronics in our homes and offices operate on the same frequency as most wireless routers: 2.4 GHz. If your router is near a wireless phone, a microwave or even a garage-door transmitter, consider a change of locale. You may also want to try changing the wireless channel on your router by going directly into the control panel on your computer and switching between channels 1, 6 and 11. Often one signal will be better than another, and you can lock it in.</p>

<h2>Tip #3: Boost Your Wireless Signal</h2>

<p>Wireless signals typically operate at a fairly low power level, but there are plenty of ways to address this problem. For instance, you can swap the antenna out for a high-gain version from manufacturers like Linksys or Cisco. If your laptop is using a wireless card to connect, you can try an external USB dongle instead. Or, if your home or office is just too big for the router to handle, you can always add a wireless repeater to catch and boost that signal to other parts of the building.</p>

<h2>Tip #4: Secure the Wireless Network</h2>

<p>One of the most common concerns about wireless networks is security, and rightly so. Without good security protocols and an excellent password, your network may be vulnerable to hacking attacks. When setting up your wireless network, make sure to select WPA/WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) security. Change the default password to repel outside attacks, and set your wireless password to something extremely difficult to guess: a minimum of 10 digits, both numbers and letters, chosen at random.</p>

<h2>Tip #5: Share the Printer</h2>

<p>One of the great advantages of a small network is that you can print from anywhere. Desktops, laptops, tablets and even smartphones can send files to a networked printer, provided you have it set up for shared access. Right-click the printer icon on your computer and check for a tab devoted to sharing. This single step can make your printer visible across the network.</p>

<h2>Tip #6: Share Your Files</h2>

<p>Windows 7 machines also allow you to set up one computer as a network drive, which means any other computer on the network can share, save and open files to and from this drive. Setting your Homegroup PC is as easy as turning on this function in the control panel. Go to 
<strong>Start &amp;gt; Control Panel &amp;gt; Network</strong> and 
<strong>Internet &amp;gt; Homegroup</strong>. Then, select what youd like to share and what kind of access you want to grant other devices.</p>

<h2>Tip #7: Update Computer Software</h2>

<p>What if you have everything set up just the way you like it, but still arent getting the speeds you want? There are a few ways to increase your speed without spending hundreds of dollars. The first and easiest is to check all your software for any available upgrades. PC drivers are frequently updated to speed up communications, and router manufacturers regularly release firmware upgrades to enhance the network as well. Check for both of these before you move on to other steps.</p>

<h2>Tip #8: Try One Manufacturer Family</h2>

<p>Strange but true: several computer experts have confirmed that many routers work best with network adapters that come from the same manufacturer. Whether you have a cable modem or a DSL adapter, consider keeping all your equipment in the family by investing in a router with the same logo on the front.</p>

<h2>Tip #9: Upgrade the Wi-Fi</h2>

<p>These days, it's all about N  802.11n, specifically. This protocol is the fastest wireless network yet, more than twice as fast as its predecessor, 802.11g. If you own a router capable of 802.11n, by all means switch it on, and make sure your various laptops and connected devices can handle the same speeds. (If they cant, dont worry  802.11n is backwards-compatible to cover older antennas.)</p>

<h2>Tip #10: Get a New Wireless Router</h2>

<p>If all else fails and you still need better speeds and greater power, it may finally be time to invest in a whole new router. Stick with the big names in this area (e.g., Linksys and Cisco) to ensure that you get industry-standard support and upgrades. Look for 802.11n if you don't already have it. Be sure to check for user-friendly features if you consider yourself anything less than an intermediate computer wonk. Visit our

<p>Network attached storage (NAS) can make your files more secure and help you share them faster.</p></blockquote>

<p>Networks are a great way to get computers and mobile devices talking, but they may not always be the fastest way to share files. Network attached storage (NAS) provides a solution.</p>

<p>Most networked files live on servers that are required to do everything at once  process emails, host applications and manage any number of platforms. When you try streaming or downloading a file from one of these overburdened servers, you might find yourself wondering if it wouldnt be faster to just walk over with a thumb drive.</p>

<p>A NAS is a shared volume that everyone on the network can use for uploading and downloading files. NAS systems run no software other than a lightweight file-management system. Theres no traditional operating system, no authentication software, no graphics and no interactive features. Your NAS is dedicated to storage and backup, period. As a result, it wont get bogged down in the details of, you know, being a computer.</p>

<h2>Types of NAS</h2>

<p>Because network attached storage is concerned with file management alone, several configurations offer different features. Various RAID (redundant array of inexpensive/independent disks) versions can add speed to your setup. Youll generally get a bigger bang for your buck by opting for faster processors and a greater number of internal drives.</p>

<p>Some intermediate/advanced users may also prefer NAS devices with plenty of extra ports and a more sophisticated, Web-based interface.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Network Attached Storage</h2>

<p>If all this sounds a bit technical, take heart: the advantages of NAS become clear once you set one up. Offices and small businesses that share a great number of large files will see a quantum leap in upload and download speeds  no small advantage when media files are your lifeblood.</p>

<p>NAS is also easy to upgrade, saving you the time and expense of buying new servers every time you require extra storage. And of course, digital backup is a widely adopted practice nowadays, and network attached storage is one of the best ways to keep everything safe and secure.</p>

<h2>File Freedom</h2>

<p>The laws of nature dictate that specialization is the key to survival, and network attached storage is a good example of this.

<p>From firewalls to password protection, here are some quick and easy tips to make your wireless network secure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wireless networks can be easy pickings for data thieves. Without proper protections in place, these miscreants can get into your network and search through its data as if youd left the door to your house wide open.</p>

<p>Bolt it all down with a strong security strategy. As with physical security controls, applying a number of tactics together tends to work best for thwarting thieves.</p>

<p>No security plan is completely bulletproof, but here are some top tips for making your wireless network as strong and secure as possible.</p>

<p>
<strong>Change default passwords and user names</strong>. To help users set up their new wireless routers, manufacturers include a temporary user name and password that can be entered on the manufacturer website for registration. Change these settings as soon as you use them, because theyre well known to data thieves.</p>

<p>
<strong>Turn on encryption</strong>. All wireless network equipment supports some type of encryption technology, which is used to scramble messages sent over the network. Several encryption options are available, but make sure you choose the most advanced type of security. During setup, your router will likely ask you what you want, and we recommend WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II) since its the strongest. (
<a title="Wireless security made easy" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/ask-anything-videos/wireless-security-made-easy.html">Check out this handy video on wireless security</a> for additional tips.)</p>

<p>
<strong>Disable auto-connect to open networks</strong>. Most computers have a setting allowing you to connect to an available network without notifying you first. This can be useful for travel, when a laptop or other device can hop onto a public Wi-Fi spot quickly. However, it poses a security risk when done at home or in an office. Change the setting on your device to keep it from straying.</p>

<p>
<strong>Enable firewalls on the router and computers</strong>. Todays routers have built-in firewall capacity, which users have the option to disable. Be sure to confirm that your firewall is turned on and operating properly. For added security, consider installing firewall software on every computer that connects to the wireless network. This will provide an additional layer of protection, and also keep the computers data safe when using a public Wi-Fi network.</p>

<p>With these safeguards, you can be assured that your wireless network will be stronger and better protected from snoops and thieves.</p>

<p>Streamline your home networking setup with these useful tips.</p></blockquote>

<p>Setting up a home network is the kind of simple task that can take hours off your day and years off your life.</p>

<p>Despite many improvements in the technologies that enable home networking, getting a network up and running requires a some knowledge and some effort. Read on for a quick rundown of the vocab and tips you can use to get started with home networking.</p>

<h2>Start with the Network Router</h2>

<p>A high-end, easy-to-use 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/Wireless-Routers-Computer-Accessories/cat_CL165748">router</a> is probably the most important investment you can make. Essential factors like the speed of your connection and the elegance of your interface depend upon this purchase.</p>

<p>The wireless protocol of choice today is 802.11n, which has evolved from the same Wi-Fi signals we used way, way back in the 2000s. 802.11n is faster and less prone to interference than older models, and does a better job managing multiple tasks within the same data stream. Stick with a major name, such as Cisco or Netgear, to ensure that you receive good support and plenty of updates. (And check out our article, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/extending-your-wireless-potential.html">Extending Your Wireless Potential</a>.)
<strong>
</strong></p>

<h2>Now, Dig In</h2>

<p>Routers are typically accessed through a primary computer on your network, appearing as a Web page that opens in your browser. Follow the routers instructions to access these controls, and then get busy making three fast changes: password, SSID and security.</p>

<p>All routers come with factory-standard passwords that are widely known and easy to guess. Job one is to undo this friendly feature by assigning a much more difficult password right away.</p>

<p>The same thing applies to your routers network name, also known as its Service Set Identifier, or 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/what-is-an-ssid.html">SSID</a>. Change this to something thats harder to guess. Lastly, the security settings should be locked down to keep hackers out. Go with Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA/WPA2) encryption on your home network, and pick a tough password.</p>

<h2>Start Sharing</h2>

<p>One great advantage to home networking is common file access: any laptop or mobile device with the proper credentials can access other computers and the files they own.</p>

<p>The easiest way to create a common hub for files is through the Homegroup setting within the Windows 7 control panel (
<strong>Start &amp;gt; Control Panel &amp;gt; Network and Internet &amp;gt; Homegroup</strong>). Here, youll find several controls to let various computers share and edit files.</p>

<p>Printers can be easily networked as well, by checking the 
<strong>Properties</strong> tab under any printer icon. If you see a section devoted to sharing, you can set this up as a common printing device for the whole network.</p>

<p>Like people, computing devices become more powerful in tandem. Get your network up and running today, and youll surely be pleased at how well your office runs.</p>

<title>Do This Now: Define Your Mobile Security Policy</title>
<description>Individual employees tend to use their personal mobile devices for business use, resulting in a potential security nightmare. If you dont have a mobile security policy in place, you need one ASAP.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Individual employees tend to use their personal mobile devices for business use, resulting in a potential security nightmare. If you dont have a mobile security policy in place, you need one ASAP.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mobile devices bring new challenges to workplace security. The wide range of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices makes it difficult to create an all-encompassing security policy  but not impossible.</p>

<p>You have two possible solutions for mobile security. One is to hire mobile device management (MDM) services to produce a standard mobile platform, an expensive proposition.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/get-to-know-byod-mobile-computing-security.html">Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)</a> systems save businesses money: Employees purchase their own devices and use them for business purposes. With Android, Apple and, eventually, Windows RT devices all working on one system, a BYOD system needs a carefully worded security policy to protect data.</p>

<h2>KISS the BYOD, but Don't Kiss it Goodbye</h2>

<p>KISS stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid, and that tried-and-true saying applies to most employee policies. Darrin Reynolds, vice president of information security at New York City-based Diversified Agency Services, suggests 
<a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/2240148521/BYOD-security-policy-not-MDM-at-heart-of-smartphone-security">writing mobile policies in crayon</a>. Hes joking, of course, but beneath the humor is a firm belief that simple, clear instructions are best when it comes to BYOD policies.</p>

<p>Reynolds suggests five basic BYOD rules. Every mobile device used to send, receive or store corporate data must meet the following conditions:</p>

<ul>

<li>The device allows you to have a Personal Identification Number.</li>

<li>The device supports code locks.</li>

<li>The device has an automatic lockout feature.</li>

<li>The device supports encryption.</li>

<li>The device supports remote data wipes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reynoldss suggestions are simple, easy to understand and enforceable  employees must prove that their device supports these requirements before it is allowed access to the network.</p>

<p>Reynolds cautions that employees should always report lost or stolen devices to the IT department before calling carriers to terminate services. Once services are terminated, the company loses all opportunity to remotely wipe data.</p>

<h2>Apps and BYOD Mobile Security</h2>

<p>Device theft is probably the single most serious challenge faced by mobile security, but dont underestimate unsafe applications. Almost all 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/new-malware-threats-take-shape-in-2012-3.html">malware</a> found on smartphones and tablets come from Trojans  malware hidden inside harmless-looking applications.</p>

<p>To protect against malware, employees should only use vetted applications from safe sources such as the Apple store. Security policies should make it clear what types of application are acceptable, which are unsafe, and how to tell the difference. Emphasize that IT departments and help desks are available to assist users in selecting safe apps.</p>

<h2>Update, Update and Update Some More</h2>

<p>If all mobile devices ran on centrally managed software, IT departments could control updates and security-patch installation. In a BYOD system, the responsibility for updating devices falls squarely on the employee.</p>

<p>Installing updates and patches protects your device and your data, and as such it is as important for private devices as it is for corporate devices. Employees should learn how to accept updates as part of their mobile security training.</p>

<h2>Define Acceptable Mobile Computing Use</h2>

<p>If an employee uses a personal device for corporate purposes, he or she needs to accept some restrictions on acceptable use. In addition to explaining how the user may use the device, the security policy needs to clearly state any banned activities. After all, the mobile is an extension of your office, so usage should comply with your broader Internet policies.</p>

<p>A security policy for mobile devices doesnt need to be complicated: indeed, to be successful the policy should be as simple and transparent as possible. Regular discussions of the policy and calls for employee suggestions help keep security issues fresh in users minds. Treat employees as participants in the process. After all, no one wants to be the individual who accidentally causes a data breach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Myths about wireless networking continue to spread despite ample evidence to the contrary. Staples tech experts can give you the true story.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many savvy computer users follow a common set of rules about wireless network use. Sadly, many of these rules are based on common misconceptions that may do more harm than good.</p>

<p>Heres a snapshot of some things you may 
<em>think</em> you know about Wi-Fi that are, in fact, dead wrong.</p>

<h2>WEP Encryption: Not Secure Enough</h2>

<p>Many people still believe theres a difference between an open network and a network secured with Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption.</p>

<p>Although a WEP-secured network cant be accessed instantaneously, this archaic protocol can be cracked quite easily. Free and simple software is available all over the Web to accomplish the task, and even a child with a laptop can sniff out your password in just seconds. The solution: Avoid WEP at all costs.</p>

<h2>Is WPA/WPA2 the Answer?</h2>

<p>Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) encryption is the best weve got right now for most wireless networks. However, just like any password system, this protocol is vulnerable to so-called dictionary attacks, which involve using brute-force methods to guess all the likely and even unlikely words a user might choose. Sound like a lot of work? It isnt. These programs complete hundreds of thousands of queries in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>The solution: Pick a random alphanumeric password at least 10 characters long. No birthdays, no movies. Only by reaching a certain level of unguessable complexity can you can reliably repel brute-force attacks.</p>

<h2>Should You Hide Your SSID?</h2>

<p>Several security analysts have pointed out the fallacy of this 
<a title="What is SSID" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/what-is-an-ssid.html" target="_blank">SSID</a> myth, which claims the safest thing you can do for your router name is to hide it from view.</p>

<p>Not only will simple software discover your hidden hotspot, but bigger problems are associated with what this feature makes your laptop do: It broadcasts your Wi-Fi configuration settings everywhere it goes. It doesnt take much resourcefulness for a hacker to record this information and use it to compromise your home system.</p>

<h2>The Rules of Public Wi-Fi</h2>

<p>Two myths surrounding public networks continue to persist despite having been debunked dozens of times. The first is that a pay network is safer than a freely available one. As it turns out, what you pay or do not pay has nothing to do with the safety of a network.</p>

<p>The second myth is that plugging your laptop into a hotel Ethernet connection is safer than using its Wi-Fi. Again: nope. The network itself is the key. If its secure, youre fine, but if its vulnerable to attack, then adding a wire in the middle wont help anyone at all.</p>

<p>What should you do with this information? Always opt for WPA security, stick with networks that require complex and random passwords and stay away from anything that says WEP on the cover. Taking just a few simple precautions can mean the difference between losing your data and enjoying the pleasure of working untethered wherever you go.</p>

<title>Windows 8 Preview Article Test</title>

<p>Windows 8 is no joke, especially at Microsoft, where the world's largest software company is preparing to upend its relatively new Windows 7 offering later this year. EasyTech has an exclusive. Lucky us? Lucky you.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Microsoft first let slip word that their next operating system, ingeniously called Windows 8 (Windows 7 is 
<em>so</em> 2011), the announcement came complete with a somewhat controversial caveat: This would be a very touch-friendly operating system.</p>

<p>More than just Microsoft's Keeping Up with the Jones's moment (Jones meaning Apple Inc., in this case), this business-altering upgrade could carry Microsoft into the future (where touch appears to be king), or represent the software's giant's biggest misstep since an all-but-forgotten operating system named Windows Vista.</p>

<p>Where do we begin? Well, how about the technology du jour, apps? Everyone's got a play in the app space, it seems, and Microsoft 8 will be no exception. This space is an increasingly important one. Those who know apps succeed (Apple), and those who do not often struggle to survive (RIM, BlackBerry).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="http://interactive/tech-services/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/windows-touchscreen-long.png">
<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2491" title="windows-touchscreen-long" src="http://interactive/tech-services/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/windows-touchscreen-long.png" alt="" width="637" height="99" /></a></p>

<h2>Windows 8 Just Wants to be Touched</h2>

<p>So why the controversy? Simple. Millions of people around the world rely on the Windows software ecosystem to get work done. None of those apps, thanks to the pitifully unsuccessful Windows tablet market, have what you'd consider to be an interface made for fingers. Gestures within Microsoft Excel, for instance, are impossibly tied to the humble mouse cursor.</p>

<p>And yet, here we are, on the verge of one of the most significant OS overhauls in Microsoft's long history. In the following video, graciously provided by our partners at Microsoft, we get an early glimpse at what we can hope to expect from this upgrade:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="http://interactive/tech-services/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/win8-video-player.png">
<img class=" wp-image-2487 aligncenter" title="win8-video-player" src="http://interactive/tech-services/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/win8-video-player.png" alt="" width="597" height="364" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see (and soon touch!), Windows 8 boasts a radically different user interface than any Windows software that's come before it. Those big, colorful tiles just beg to be touched, and every major app or service you'd need or regularly associate with the Windows brand is right there with its own tile. The interface is called metro (little M) and it's definitely the most talked about and obsessed over feature that Windows 8 has to offer. But this is Windows. It's more than just a pretty face, right? Of course. There's so much more.</p>

<h2>Windows 8 App Ecosystem</h2>

<p>No operating system in this day and age would be complete without a hat tip to the growing "app" movement, and Windows 8 will be no  exception. Already developers are clamoring to set up camp within Windows 8's app ecosystem, which they obviously hope will become the cash machine that Apple currently enjoys with its industry-leading App Store.</p>

<p>From solar farms to employee gardens, heres a look at some U.S. technology companies that have undertaken impressive green initiatives.</p></blockquote>

<p>The United States is rife with green-focused technology companies  from mom-and-pop start-ups that use wind power to huge tech firms that harness solar power for their data centers.</p>

<p>Although you might not aspire to get off the grid, a glimpse into these companies might inspire you to pursue a few more green-computing strategies.</p>

<p>Heres a whos-who guide to the greenest tech companies in the nation.</p>

<h2>Google</h2>

<p>This Mountain View, California-based technology company isnt just about providing better search results. Theres such a major focus on environmentally friendly measures that the company has a name for its internal movement: Google Green. Some of its latest eco moves:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Data centers</strong> that are some of the most efficient in the world: Googles centers use only about half of what traditional data centers consume, saving the company billions of dollars in energy costs since its founding.</li>

<li>
<strong>Green power from wind:</strong> Google purchases clean energy from wind-farm owners, giving them the funding they need to expand their operations.</li>

<li>
<strong>On-campus green initiatives:</strong> The company relies on its employees to make suggestions and start campaigns for reducing Googles environmental impact. As a result, theres an extensive bike-to-work program, solar panels on the roofs and electric charging stations in the parking lot.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Panasonic</h2>

<p>Based in Secaucus, New Jersey, Panasonic has been interested in green initiatives for decades and even established a pollution survey committee in 1970. In 2006 the company created full-time positions for environmental specialists. Some of its latest eco moves include:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Environmentally friendly design:</strong> The engineers at Panasonic create products that are energy-efficient, use lead-free soldering and keep plastic resins to a minimum. Recent examples include projectors with automatic power-save features, tapeless video production tools and energy-efficient mobile computers.</li>

<li>
<strong>Consumer campaigns:</strong> The company launched a conservation program for its customers, promoting the reduction of carbon emissions through use of energy-saving products.</li>

<li>
<strong>Green manufacturing:</strong> Panasonic has worked to eliminate heavy metals from its production, including lead, mercury, cadmium and other environmental toxins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verizon</h2>

<p>Many communications companies work to reduce their environmental impact, but New York-based Verizon is determined to go above and beyond with its green initiatives. The company has been active in helping raise awareness of sustainable business practices and aims to be an environmental leader in the industry. Some of its latest eco moves:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Promotion of electric vehicles:</strong> The company recently partnered with VIA Motors to develop plug-in electric vehicles that could be used in Verizons fleet. Already, Verizon maintains a large fleet of alternative-energy vehicles, including hybrid vans and trucks.</li>

<li>
<strong>Announcement of ambitious goals:</strong> In March 2012, as part of the companys broad sustainability efforts, Verizon announced it would cut its carbon intensity in half by 2020. The term refers to the amount of energy needed to move data across Verizons network.</li>

<li>
<strong>Rallies for recycling electronics:</strong> Many companies have had success with recycling days for electronics, since these items can be difficult for consumers and employees to discard on their own. During its 2011 rallies, Verizon collected more than 358,000 pounds of e-waste and recycled the items, keeping the electronics out of landfills.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hewlett-Packard</h2>

<p>Based in Palo Alto, California, HP has been at the forefront of technology innovation in the United States since its founding in 1939. The company focuses strongly on sustainability, for its customers as well as its own business. Some of its latest eco moves:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Employee gardens:</strong> With urban farming and organic produce gaining more momentum, many companies are seeing the benefit of employee gardens. During its 25 years of running an employee garden program, HP has found employees are less stressed and eat more vegetables, and the companys land is put to better use.</li>

<li>
<strong>Reducing the effect of business travel:</strong> In an effort to minimize greenhouse-gas emissions caused by travel, HP helps employees choose low-carbon forms of transportation when traveling on business. When employees book a trip, theyre given information about the emissions associated with their journey and provided with multiple options (including teleconferencing, reducing the need for travel altogether).</li>

<li>
<strong>Renewable energy initiatives:</strong> HP looks for ways to participate in green energy programs worldwide. This has led to offices in Mexico using solar water-heaters in kitchens and bathrooms, solar-power systems in Israel and wind-power usage in Ireland. In the United States, the company has a rooftop solar-power system that fuels the large HP Labs research facility.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SAS</h2>

<p>Software firm SAS is so committed to environmental initiatives that its corporate website sports a photo of a lamb nibbling grass at the companys solar-energy farm. The Cary, North Carolina-based company focuses on a range of programs, from water conservation to biodiversity protection. Some of its latest eco moves:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Waste management:</strong> The company monitors its waste stream and offers numerous office recycling programs, even for items like scrap metal and shipping pallets.</li>

<li>
<strong>Eco education:</strong> To boost environmental awareness, SAS sponsors tours of its solar farms, plans companywide Earth Day activities and hosts an online green site to give employees more information about initiatives and events.</li>

<li>
<strong>Green sourcing and procurement:</strong> SAS makes extensive use of green products, such as environmentally friendly cleaning supplies and low-emissions paints for its campus buildings. It also works to eliminate unnecessary purchases and extend the life cycle of its existing assets and furniture.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Company Name Here</h2>

<p>Although many companies on this list are global brands with thousands of employees, you dont need to be in the Fortune 500 to implement some major green initiatives. See our article on 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/10-simple-steps-toward-an-effective-green-small-business.html">

<p>Mobile devices can create serious security risks for small and medium-sized businesses. Avoid the pitfalls with these tips.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mobile business computing is here to stay  or go, as the case may be. Todays small and medium-sized businesses rely more than ever on a growing slate of mobile devices whose security profiles can vary widely. Keep your companys trade secrets and sensitive data secure with these quick tips.</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Set passwords and auto-lock.</strong> All major smartphones permit password and passkey protection. Enable this feature on every device in your network, and be sure to turn on auto-lock for some extra peace of mind.</p>

<p>
<strong>2. Disable auto-complete.</strong> Many phone and tablet browsers offer this feature, which fills in names and passwords to streamline your browsing experience. Disable auto-complete to prevent unwanted visitors from breezing past essential log-in screens.</p>

<p>
<strong>3. Encrypt your data.</strong> Plenty of good software is available to encode sensitive documents with one touch. Have your workforce do this as a matter of habit, and you can prevent most cases of data theft.</p>

<p>
<strong>4. Invest in antivirus software.</strong> Its a myth that smartphones and tablets dont get viruses or other malware. In fact, todays mobile devices represent the fastest-growing frontier in hacking. Foil the bad guys with a strong antivirus app, and then keep it up to date.</p>

<p>
<strong>5. Add remote wipe and location tools.</strong> Many mobile operating systems offer apps that are designed expressly to foil thieves. These include features such as live GPS reporting, and pictures. Most will also let you perform a remote wipe, which instructs the device to destroy all its data.</p>

<p>
<strong>6. Back up your mobile devices often.</strong> This simple habit can make the remote wipe option far less painful.</p>

<p>
<strong>7. Go thin with your devices.</strong> Many businesses prefer to keep important documents in the cloud  not stored locally on their devices. Fewer saved docs mean less risk.</p>

<p>
<strong>8. Watch what you download.</strong> Encourage best practices among your employees, and consider creating a whitelist of acceptable apps to help keep infected software off your network.</p>

<p>
<strong>9. Dictate which devices are permitted at all.</strong> Your IT consultant can direct you to some of the safest phones, tablets and laptops on the market. Buy in bulk.</p>

<p>
<strong>10. Stay out of bad wireless neighborhoods.</strong> Wi-Fi flows freely all around us, but many of these networks are filled with bad actors bent on stealing your companys data. Stick with hot spots you know and always opt for a secure connection.</p>

<p>Your mobile workforce can be the engine of your future success. Like any good machine, though, it must be tuned and maintained to avoid a costly breakdown.</p>

<p>Getting a new company launched involves plenty of technology purchases. Make sure youre getting your business off to a green start.</p></blockquote>

<p>Entrepreneurs must juggle countless issues when growing a business, from brand-building to hiring to office rentals.</p>

<p>Although it can be challenging to add one more component into the mix, focusing on green computing and other green strategies from the start can create a solid foundation for your business. It could even make you a little money in the long run (see our article, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/forget-saving-lets-make-money-with-green-computing.html">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Forget Saving, Lets 
<em>Make</em> Money with Green Computing</span></a>).</p>

<p>Lets look at the essentials that any new business or one-person shop should evaluate to save some cash while reducing energy needs.</p>

<h2>Comparison Shopping</h2>

<p>Choosing a primary business computer is a large part of any small businesss green-computing strategy. Many experts have noted that laptops are kinder to the environment because they use less power, especially if you dont plan to attach an external monitor. However, quite a few desktops have earned high marks for energy efficiency.</p>

<p>To start searching for your green computer, check out the 
<a href="http://www.epeat.net/">Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool</a> (EPEAT). Developed by the Green Electronics Council, this free, easy-to-use online tool helps you compare desktops, laptops and monitors based on environmental factors. EPEAT ranks items like displays, desktop computers and tablet notebooks by giving them a score of bronze, silver or gold. Think of it as the Olympics of green computing.</p>

<h2>Features to Consider</h2>

<p>The EPEAT employs a point system based on a number of positive criteria. Even if you skip using EPEAT and go shopping on your own, these particular factors are good to consider when comparing computers:</p>

<p>
<strong>Project longevity/lifecycle:</strong> This is a big one when outfitting your office. The longer a computer is designed to live, the more environmentally friendly its considered to be (less in the tech landfill, in other words). But a longer life cycle is a big boost for your bottom line, too. If you dont have to replace your laptop every couple of years, you save money over time.</p>

<p>When determining how long a computer might last, consider the availability of replacement parts, how easily it can be upgraded with common tools and whether theres an extended warranty or service agreement. Also, factor some regular upkeep into your budget  much like your car, a computer benefits from a bit of 
<a title="maintenance" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/four-tips-to-make-your-pc-faster-than-ever.html">maintenance</a> to keep it running strong.</p>

<p>
<strong>Energy conservation:</strong> Nearly every computer maker boasts energy-usage stats, but inspect the numbers carefully and do some comparison-shopping. A great resource for these types of figures is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)s Energy Star program. The Energy Star seal makes it easy to assess which desktops and laptops are the most energy-efficient. The Energy Star site also offers a download for an Excel document that helps you calculate office-equipment energy costs.</p>

<p>
<strong>Design for end of life:</strong> During the excitement of computer purchasing, no one wants to think about what will happen when the machine needs to be discarded or recycled. But considering these end-of-life issues is important for understanding the regulations and tactics you may need to follow a few years from now.</p>

<p>Some computers are more easily rehabbed than others, which means you can donate them to nonprofit organizations or schools. This could involve a potential tax break for you, and fresh equipment for them.</p>

<h2>Other Technology Needs</h2>

<p>In addition to your workhorse computer, your office will most likely be stocked with numerous peripherals that can make a difference to your green-computing profile. Here are some tips on picking eco-friendly choices to round out your tech setup (for equipment like printers, copiers, monitors and servers):</p>

<ul>

<li>Much like your computer selections, consider all the factors that go into a purchasing decision for other equipment, particularly yearly estimated energy costs, product lifecycle expectancy and recycling opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Look for an Energy Star rating for each piece of equipment. To gain top marks from Energy Star, a manufacturer has to prove a product will contribute to significant energy savings and deliver high performance. This makes it easy to identify equipment that will offer savings on energy bills without sacrificing productivity.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Make sure equipment has practical power-management functions, such as sleep mode or low-power settings.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Create a spreadsheet to track energy-usage costs, which will help you tweak future management or purchasing strategies. Having a plan for green computing is crucial to keeping you on the path of energy efficiency (for more insight on planning, see our article, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/the-biggest-mistakes-every-business-makes-when-going-green.html">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Biggest Mistakes Every Business Makes When Going Green</span></a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Green Settings</h2>

<p>Once youve done all the evaluation and purchasing for your green-computing components, make sure they stay as energy-efficient as possible by employing some strong power-management policies:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Use power strips with surge protectors.</strong> This will keep your equipment safer during electrical storms and allow you to turn off multiple pieces of equipment quickly.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Disable screen savers.</strong> In general, screen savers dont save energy, even though it seems like the computer might be in sleep mode. In fact, some graphics-intensive screen savers can cause the computer to use as much as twice the amount of energy it uses during normal operation, and even prevents it from flipping into sleep mode.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Evaluate your power-management settings.</strong> The EPA recommends setting computers to enter system standby (or hibernate) after 30 to 60 minutes of inactivity. But some people choose to save even more energy by setting these thresholds even lower.</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting a business or outfitting a one-person shop can be an exciting opportunity to make some fresh technology decisions. When evaluating what to purchase, keep a little more green in your pocket by taking the time to compare green-computing options.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mobile computing comes with some serious security risks. Limit the exposure of your small business with these simple steps.</p></blockquote>

<p>The world of small business is on the move  literally. Gone are the days when you could operate a corner store and rely on nothing more complex than location, location, location to drive business.</p>

<p>Today, your company most likely travels with you via laptop, tablet and phone, which raises an interesting question: How can you lock up the store when your store encircles the globe and extends into the cloud?</p>

<p>Good news: plenty of costly corporate mistakes have paved the way for some best practices in mobile security. Follow these simple steps to limit your companys mobile risk in a matter of hours.</p>

<h2>Secure Passwords to Go</h2>

<p>It seems simple, but a staggering number of mobile devices are still not password-protected. Plenty of software exists to secure every class of device, from iOS to Android to BlackBerry. Many of these let you choose between passwords, pass codes, image keys and even facial recognition. When deployed in tandem with auto-lock, this basic step can save your company untold headaches.</p>

<h2>Encryption Counts</h2>

<p>Theres an even better way to hide the sensitive data on your mobile device: encrypt it. Plenty of cheap software is available to encode your documents and spreadsheets into undecipherable gibberish, ensuring that they cant be cracked without an appropriate key. Install this software onto every device in your company, and remind your employees frequently.</p>

<h2>Mobile Antivirus Software</h2>

<p>Phones were once considered the final frontier of malware-free computing, but today that era merely seems quaint. Viruses, worms and other baddies have crawled into the mobile space, infecting every major operating system out there. The solution: download a lightweight, mobile antivirus program that offers regular scans, and checks all of your downloads. Youll be glad you did.</p>

<h2>This Device Will Self-Destruct in 10</h2>

<p>Theres one more way to secure a mobile device that has fallen into the wrong hands: the remote wipe. You might call this the nuclear option  a command you send from another computer that tells your device to essentially destroy itself. Everything gets erased: documents, apps, messages. If youve adopted a good backup solution, you should have copies ready elsewhere, leaving your would-be digital assailant without anything of substance.</p>

<p>Some more advanced protocols are worth your research as well, including virtual private networks (VPNs) and digital certificates. But the vast majority of SMB hacks are unsophisticated enough that these simple steps will foil them. Just remember to keep your software updated and your workforce informed, both about your policies and about any threats that may emerge.</p>

<p>A little caution is all it takes to keep your business mobile and secure.</p>

<p>There are many easy strategies for making an office greener, but few companies take the time to make such tweaks. Here are some tips for standing out and getting green.</p></blockquote>

<p>When thinking about a greener office, do you envision a fresh coat of moss-colored paint, and then calling it done?</p>

<p>For small-business owners who already have too many items on the to-do list, researching and employing green strategies can seem like schedule overload. But its easy to boost energy efficiency, sustainability and environmental awareness without spending much time  or even much money.</p>

<p>Here are 10 quick tips for making changes:</p>

<ol start="1">

<li>
<strong>Stake the vampires.</strong> Take a look at the energy-saver settings on all electronics, and make sure theyre set to power down or off at the end of the day and on weekends. Many offices suffer higher electricity bills from vampire devices that drain lots of energy when not in use.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">

<li>
<strong>Check the lights.</strong> Use motion-sensor lights on areas that are less busy or only used occasionally. This could involve installing lights on certain rows in a warehouse, for example, or in conference rooms.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">

<li>
<strong>Go organic.</strong> Use fair-trade, shade-grown or organic coffee in the shared coffee pot. Youll reduce employees exposure to pesticides and herbicides, and help protect rain forests, too.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">

<li>
<strong>Replace disposable cups with washable mugs. </strong>This is a popular measure in many offices because it reduces waste. According to 
<em>National Geographic</em>, if an office of 15 people replaced three disposable cups per day with reusable mugs, theyd save about 11,000 paper cups from the landfill each year.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">

<li>
<strong>Aim for a paperless office.</strong> Although this can be challenging, setting the goal is important  and gives you targets for best practices. For example, you could state that as of the fourth quarter of this year, all contracts will be sent through email (and electronically signed, if possible).</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">

<li>
<strong>Adjust the temperature.</strong> In many offices, the air conditioning is set so high in the summer that employees wear sweaters at work. Setting the temp just a few degrees warmer during the summer months will be more comfortable and save you hundreds of dollars in energy bills.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="7">

<li>
<strong>Share a ride. </strong>Offer discounted bus passes and incentives for carpooling and bike riding. Not only will this help every employee have a lighter carbon footprint, but it will also show employees you care, which increases morale.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="8">

<li>
<strong>Buy Energy Star-rated light bulbs, fixtures and appliances.</strong> These use far less energy than conventional options. Even better, use more natural lighting whenever possible  its free!</li>
</ol>

<ol start="9">

<li>
<strong>Use power strips for computers, printers and other peripherals.</strong> This way, multiple devices can be turned off at once, and employees can be reminded to just hit one button at the end of the day (especially on Fridays).</li>
</ol>

<ol start="10">

<li>
<strong>Get employees involved.</strong> You dont need to do all the work yourself  employees are often excited to be part of a green movement and eager to share their ideas.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, many businesses find that going green is a strategy best achieved in slow, steady stages. Making greenness an ongoing priority will keep you from feeling overwhelmed and can even help your bottom line (see our article, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/forget-saving-lets-make-money-with-green-computing.html">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Forget Saving, Lets 
<em>Make</em> Money with Green Computing</span></a>). A coat of green paint doesnt hurt, either  as long as its the low-VOC kind, of course.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Small-business owners are far more likely to commit a security error. Avoid the most common mistakes with these tips.</p></blockquote>

<p>For a small-business owner, its tempting to do things the scrappy way  your own IT, your own Web design, even your own security.</p>

<p>Alas, this final area is where many small businesses drop the ball, forgoing the basics of cyber-security and thus placing their livelihoods in danger. Below is a review of the most common security mistakes that small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) commit on a regular basis. Dont follow suit!</p>

<h2>The Network Effect</h2>

<p>Most small businesses cannot afford industry-standard networks from the likes of Sun or Cisco, so many business owners build their networks off the shelf. Consumer routers are a common fixture, but these come with a built-in risk: It only takes a hacker minutes to look up a list of default passwords, tunnel into your router and take over every computer and file your business owns. So change your router passwords, activate the strongest wireless protection available and check for unauthorized computers on your network.</p>

<h2>When Storm Clouds Gather</h2>

<p>
<a title="Cloud computing" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/embrace-the-cloud-or-get-out-of-the-way-2.html">Cloud computing</a> is all the rage these days, with major corporations and SMBs leaping with both feet into the world of remotely hosted solutions. Be aware, however, that not all cloud computing is created equal. Stick with major vendors such as 
<a title="Carbonite" href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/carbonite-online-backup/">Carbonite</a>, 
<a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> and 
<a href="http://www.box.com">Box</a>. The better encryption and stronger security measures are worth those few extra pennies a month.</p>

<h2>Orphaned Laptops or Smartphones</h2>

<p>One of the most common security risks in small business is the forgotten laptop or smartphone. Absent password protection and good onboard security, these misplaced devices are little more than standing-open doors to your network. The answer: Secure every machine that has access to sensitive information, and dont be afraid to enforce severe measures about which devices are allowed on the network in the first place.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Fouls</h2>

<p>Of course, not all errors may be yours; another big source of security breaches is third-party partners. Many SMBs rely on a loosely affiliated network of vendors, such as hosting services, merchant accounts, fulfillment centers and billing companies. Any one of these could become the index case for a viral pandemic that knocks out your servers. Stick with companies you know and trust, and be sure to inquire pointedly about how they plan to protect your data.</p>

<h2>The Click of Death</h2>

<p>Finally we arrive at a familiar security lapse, the same one that strikes individuals around the world: the dumb click. For instance, clicking on attachments in spam e-mails or visiting infected websites from company machines. Vigilant training and repetition are the keys to limiting your risk. You may also consider installing some firewall software to keep your employees out of the Web's worst neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The good news is that many security lapses are easily preventable. Take these tips, and you can work without fear! Consult an

<title>It Isn't Easy Being Green</title>
<description>When going with green computing solutions, know about upfront costs and challenges before you begin  and prevent headaches later on.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>When going with green computing solutions, know about upfront costs and challenges before you begin  and prevent headaches later on.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kermit the Frog had it right when he sang about the challenges of being green.</p>

<p>Although he might not have had green computing in mind, the sentiment still applies: when it comes to going green, there can be pain points alongside the benefits. (For an overview of the topic, see our article, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/what-is-green-computing.html">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Is Green Computing?</span></a>)</p>

<p>Many small businesses get good return on income after installing new equipment and systems, but before that return come costs. Heres what you should keep in mind as you transition to a greener future, so you can anticipate the challenges and zoom right to the advantages.</p>

<h2>Upfront Green Computing Purchases</h2>

<p>The most visible part of any green-computing strategy is updating equipment like laptops and printers. Energy-saving computers and peripherals come in endless varieties but, of course, arent free.</p>

<p>But because these machines are more efficient, they tend to last longer than previous models, so your investment dollars can be stretched. Other equipment that might need replacement includes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Desktop computers</li>

<li>Scanners</li>

<li>Monitors</li>

<li>Copiers</li>

<li>Servers</li>

<li>Routers</li>

<li>Software</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, you should take a look at every piece of equipment in your organization and consider whether it needs replacement, even down to the networked printers and photocopier.</p>

<h2>Hidden Costs</h2>

<p>Equipment like environmentally friendly laptops and more earth-friendly peripherals are expected, but what about consultants hours or PC upgrades? Often, a green-computing strategy will have less-expected costs like these, and you should make sure your business doesnt get blindsided.</p>

<p>When creating a green-computing plan, factor in all kinds of expenses, not just hardware purchases. Heres a sampling of potential costs in your move toward being green:</p>

<ul>

<li>Monthly service costs for cloud computing</li>

<li>Consultant time for technology implementation, service or long-range planning</li>

<li>Upgrades to network hardware or software</li>

<li>Time spent on strategic planning, research, talking to vendors and IT tasks such as power management</li>

<li>Staff training</li>

<li>Disposal of older PCs and other hardware</li>

<li>Server-virtualization expense, which may involve lots of IT time and hardware upgrades</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider all these and other possible variables.</p>

<p>For example, when considering a move to server virtualization, look at the costs of new servers. However, also keep in mind that you may need consulting time, IT support, downtime for company servers, different cooling in the server room, disposal of the older servers and upgrades to the network (which itself could involve software tweaks, capacity planning and network testing).</p>

<p>Fortunately, these types of changes layer on top of each other to create greater efficiency and lesser costs down the line. For instance, a server virtualization may reduce the need for purchasing servers more extensively within the next few years, giving you quick return on income for shifting to green computing.</p>

<h2>Beware the Green-Computing Time Bandits</h2>

<p>Of these costs, the most unexpected tends to be the time spent developing a green-computing strategy and making sure it gets implemented. When creating a plan, anticipate how much time each task will take, so that you can be realistic about timing.</p>

<p>For example, staff training may take an hour of actual meeting time. But then there are the seven hours needed to 
<em>prepare</em> for the training by doing research, creating a presentation, providing handouts, talking with IT about issues to address and even picking up the donuts and muffins.</p>

<p>That means an entire workday of your time will be spent in preparing and conducting a staff training session about green computing. Being cognizant of that type of time commitment will help you plan your schedule better, and give you a clearer perspective about what each step of the process involves. (For more ideas about what goes into green-computing planning, see our article, 
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Biggest Mistakes Every Business Makes When Going Green</span>.)</p>

<h2>Ample Benefits to Be Realized</h2>

<p>Costs, expenses and time commitments sometimes it might seem like green computing wouldnt be worth all the effort, but keep a larger goal in mind as you make the transition to a greener office.</p>

<p>Not only do green-computing moves benefit the environment and create a more sustainable future for all of us, they also provide ample advantages for businesses of every size. (For a look at money-boosting strategies, see our article, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/forget-saving-lets-make-money-with-green-computing.html">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Forget Saving, Let's Make Money with Green Computing</span>.</a>)</p>

<p>Heres a glimpse at some other top benefits:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Significant energy savings,</strong>  thanks to more efficient hardware and better power-conservation tactics, as well as disconnection of ghost machines that are hooked up to the network but are no longer used.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Strong branding and goodwill toward the company.</strong> Customers appreciate firms that take steps to be more environmentally aware, and potential employees view those types of companies more favorably. Furthermore, if you plan to add green computing to your HR and PR communications, adding it now could have a positive effect on attempts to highlight your business as a greener brand.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Better network connections.</strong> Energy Star-qualified computers are designed to maintain a connection while in low-power or sleep mode, which means greater use of low-power modes without loss of system capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>More efficient cooling</strong> for in-house data-center rooms.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Reduced need</strong> for larger data centers within the organization, leading to less IT time, fewer equipment costs and better upgrade cycles.</li>
</ul>

<p>The kindness to the Earth cant be underestimated, either. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that if all computers in the United States met Energy Star requirements, savings in energy costs would total about $1.8 billion per year. Also, greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced to an amount equivalent to taking two million vehicles off the road.</p>

<p>Kermit may have despaired of the difficulty of being green, but he also noted that green can be cool and friendly: I am green and itll do fine, its beautiful, he sang. Taking the same perspective with green computing can help you do your part for more sustainability, not to mention profitability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Going green can save a business time and money, but mistakes are easy to make if you dont have a plan. We identify the top challenges and explain how to do it right.</p></blockquote>

<p>Everyone makes mistakes, but some are more preventable than others.</p>

<p>Green computing can help small businesses save time, money and sanity, while conserving energy and efficiency. Some businesses, however, jump into the strategy without a plan, simply for the sake of going green. And that can lead to big mistakes.</p>

<p>Avoid those pitfalls. Heres a look at some of the biggest mistakes businesses make  and how to sidestep them.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Starting without a plan.</strong> Like any technology implementation, green computing makes the most sense with a comprehensive plan that's developed before any purchasing or implementation. Look at problem areas first, and go from there. For example, if energy usage is a big concern, examine small and large steps that will help, like putting automatic power-down settings in place on weekends.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Trying to do too much, too fast.</strong> Green computing encompasses a wide range of strategies, from power management for printers to usage of cloud computing (for an overview, see our article, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/what-is-green-computing.html">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Is Green Computing</span>?</a>). Attempting to implement green computing across an entire organization too quickly and too extensively can create hiccups in every area of the enterprise.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Failing to create a tiered implementation system.</strong> As part of the overall strategy, you should prioritize the steps you plan to take. For instance:</li>
</ul>

<ol>

<ol>

<li>Address paper-waste issues.</li>

<li>Institute energy-efficiency practices.</li>

<li>Reduce the number of desktop computers.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<p>Setting a time frame for these types of green-computing goals is helpful for determining return on income as well.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Not thinking about the cloud.</strong> Virtualization and cloud computing are considered green-computing strategies because they increase energy efficiency through shared computing power. For example, if 50 companies use the same data center rather than 50 separate data centers, theyll help reduce overall electricity, cooling and water usage.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Ignoring the impact of e-waste.</strong> Part of green computing is recognizing the impact of computers and peripherals on the waste stream. While moving to more energy-efficient laptops is important, its equally crucial to consider how the older machines are disposed of or recycled. The 
<a title="EPA" href="http://epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> has a resource page that details regulations and standards, and answers questions about donation and recycling of used electronics. Link to Staples free recycling page.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Seeing green computing as an expense or a pain.</strong> Although creating a green-computing plan takes time and some upgrades might mean upfront costs, green-computing strategies can greatly benefit your business. Some companies even make money through this practice (see our article, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/forget-saving-lets-make-money-with-green-computing.html">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Forget Saving, Lets 
<em>Make</em> Money with Green Computing</span></a>). Rather than viewing the changes as more items for your already lengthy to-do list, see them as tactics with long-term advantages that benefit the environment, your business and your bottom line.</li>
</ul>

<p>By sidestepping mistakes like these, going green will be much more efficient and much less painful for your business.</p>

<p>Turbo-charge that old PC with these essential tips and tools.</p></blockquote>

<p>A moment arises in the life of every PC when obsolescence beckons. Little tasks that once were completed in the blink of an eye now seem to grind on long enough for an actual snooze. The programs you use every day become slower and slower, and the machine becomes crankier and crankier.Your computer is just getting old, you say. Its the circle of life. Or is it? In fact, many people dont realize that PC machinery does not necessarily degrade over time. Your hard drive and other hardware are probably humming along just fine. Whats changed is that fragmented programs, unused applications and unwanted code are probably gumming up the works.</p>

<p>Its time for some spring cleaning. Heres how to do it.</p>

<h2>Kill Unused Applications</h2>

<p>Step one is to stop the several dozen unused programs that are running in the background of your PC right now. Hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete and scan the list for anything that looks unimportant. Close these one by one and check for a performance bump.</p>

<p>For a longer-lasting fix, head over to the Control Panel and check your master list of installed software. Chances are, youll discover several programs with no discernible purpose. These may have installed alongside the software you actually use; feel free to kill them with impunity. (Go to Start &amp;gt; Control Panel &amp;gt; Programs &amp;gt; Programs and Features &amp;gt; Uninstall a Program.)</p>

<h2>Exterminate the Bugs</h2>

<p>Viruses and malware may be part of the problem as well, especially for older PCs, which have not always been protected by a good antivirus program. These wont show up through conventional channels, so some dedicated software will be required to ferret them out. Download a few good virus-scanning applications and run them all.</p>

<h2>Beware Overextension</h2>

<p>Browsers come with their own unique source of ballast: extensions. These little add-ons work in tandem with your browser, offering special functions such as photo-zooming and ad-blocking. Once they start to pile up, however, extensions can slow your favorite websites under the burden of all that extra processing. The solution? Disable or uninstall your extensions one by one until you locate the culprit (or culprits).</p>

<h2>Make Your PC Whole</h2>

<p>Fragmentation can affect everything your PC does as well. As your data is saved over time, it gets slotted all over the hard drive. Soon your programs have to work increasingly hard to cull the bits they need from the bytes they dont. Defragmentation is the answer. Go to 
<strong>Windows Button &amp;gt; Accessories &amp;gt; System Tools &amp;gt; Disk Defragmenter</strong> and run a scan. This could take a while. Consider coffee.</p>

<p>Good luck with your spring cleaning. We're sure youll find it well worth the effort!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Windows 8 contains some neat little tricks to help users navigate the operating system, but you have to find them first. The Staples EasyTech team goes looking for hidden treasure in Windows 8.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the launch of 
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview">Microsoft's Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a>, the EasyTech staff leaped at the chance to explore the new operating system, returning with all manner of secret treasures, useful shortcuts and, in one suspicious case, a bad sunburn and a flower lei. Here are a few of our favorite Windows 8 secrets.</p>

<h2>Get Off the Beaten Path with Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Windows 8 represents a serious attempt on the part of Microsoft to break into the touch-screen tablet market. This doesnt mean, however, that mouse and keyboard users have been left out in the cold. Windows 8 includes a number of keyboard shortcuts that makes navigating from the Start screen and switching applications quick and easy.</p>

<p>Pressing the 
<strong>Windows</strong> button by itself jumps you between the Start screen and the last app you used. Other favorites at EasyTech HQ include:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Windows button + D:</strong> opens the Desktop.</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows + E:</strong> opens Explorer</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows +F:</strong> opens File Search</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows + I:</strong> launches Settings</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows + Q:</strong> opens App Search</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows + Tab:</strong> Cycle through open apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft has improved the old screenshot shortcut. Pressing 
<strong>Windows + PrtScr</strong> doesnt add the screen shot to Clipboard anymore. Instead, the shortcut saves the screenshot directly to the 
<strong>My Pictures</strong> file under the name Screenshot.png.</p>

<h2>Multiple Monitor Machinations</h2>

<p>Users increasingly work with two monitors, and Windows 8 acknowledges this. Pressing 
<strong>Windows + PgUp</strong> moves your currently selected app to the left-hand monitor, while 
<strong>Windows + PgDn</strong> shoots the app over to the right-hand monitor.</p>

<h2>Organizing App Groups</h2>

<p>Organizing Metro apps into groups turns out to be easy and intuitive. Choose one of the apps you want to include in the new group and drag the tile to an empty area of the Start screen. A new app group automatically starts. Move apps into the new group by continuing to drag them there.</p>

<p>To name the new group, click the small icon in the bottom right of the screen. The Metro tiles will shrink to thumbnails. Right-click the new group and a 
<strong>Name Group</strong> icon pops up. Click this icon and type in the new groups name.</p>

<h2>You Get What You Type</h2>

<p>Here's a quick time-saver if you want to access a program in Windows 8 without hunting through all the Start screen app tiles. Just type in the name of the program you want. You dont need to click on the screen or open a search box, just start typing with the mouse pointer anywhere on the screen and Windows 8 finds the program for you. Its a nice little time-saver when you need to open little-used programs.</p>

<h2>Scheduling Computer Maintenance</h2>

<p>Windows 8 helpfully automates system maintenance tasks, such as software updates, viral scans and similar diagnostics. Unfortunately, the default time for these important housecleaning tasks is set to 3:00 a.m. Thats fine if your hardware allows the system to wake up the computer, but pretty much useless if your system lacks that ability.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you can quickly change these settings by launching the 
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, selecting 
<strong>System and Security</strong> and clicking on 
<strong>Action Center</strong>. Once the 
<strong>Action Center </strong>opens, click on 
<strong>Maintenance</strong>. Now you can choose a more convenient time for maintenance under the 
<strong>Start Maintenance</strong> option.</p>

<h2>Sneaky Syncing</h2>

<p>Windows 8 can synchronize settings on multiple devices, so your tablet, Windows Phone and PC can share the same Windows Live account. The operating system will share Contacts, calendar events and other information among your devices.</p>

<p>Handy though this is, some information may be too sensitive for synchronizing. You can customize the syncing operation by pressing 
<strong>Windows + I</strong> and clicking 
<strong>More PC Settings</strong>. Click on 
<strong>Sync Your Settings</strong> and you get a list of 12 possible items that you can omit from synchronization. Some of these items are highly sensitive, such as website passwords. Others, such as background screens, are unlikely to attract the attention of identity thieves, but handy if you like to customize devices individually.</p>

<p>If you dont want to synchronize your devices, choose 
<strong>Local Account </strong>instead of 
<strong>Microsoft Account </strong>when you set up your account. You can switch between Local Account and Microsoft Account at any time by opening the 
<strong>PC Settings </strong>and selecting 
<strong>Users</strong>.</p>

<h2>Finding Your Recycle Bin</h2>

<p>Windows 8 lists open applications in its left-hand navigation pane (just move the mouse pointer to the left side of the screen to open the pane). The navigation pane is designed with simplicity in mind: You won't see any links to your 
<strong>Control Panel</strong> or 
<strong>Recycle Bin</strong> here. If you like quick access to your folders, click 
<strong>View</strong> on the pane and then click 
<strong>Options</strong>. Now you can select 
<strong>Show All Folders</strong>.</p>

<h2>Refresh and Wipe</h2>

<p>While Windows 8 runs quite well, circumstance may force you to restore the system. The new 
<strong>Recovery</strong> option in the 
<strong>Control Panel</strong> gives you three different options for restoring your system. 
<strong>System Restore</strong> works pretty much the same way it always has, restoring your settings to the last System Restore point.</p>

<p>The 
<strong>Refresh Your PC</strong> option completely reinstalls Windows 8 while keeping your existing files intact. And when the time comes to replace your PC, the 
<strong>Reset Your PC</strong> button completely wipes your files before reinstalling Windows. (Pro tip: Beware confusing these two buttons.)</p>

<h2>Pruning Your Startup Menu</h2>

<p>Startup Creep afflicts many a Windows user. Many programs insist on helpfully adding themselves to your Startup menu during installation, so they open automatically when you boot up the computer. Auto-start programs are like leeches, sucking up your systems resources. Depending on the software, you may not even realize a program is opening every time you boot up.</p>

<p>Windows 8 has added a Startup tab to a redesigned 
<strong>Task Manager</strong>. The 
<strong>Startup</strong> link lists all programs that open during Startup. You can check off any programs you dont want running and then click the 
<strong>Disable</strong> button.</p>

<title>What Is a Network SSID?</title>

<p>If you dont know what an SSID is, or why you should even care, no problem! Well demystify SSID, and its related terms like BSSID.</p></blockquote>

<p>If youve ever set up a wireless network, no doubt youve come across the term SSID. You likely realize an SSID is something important, but you might not know why.</p>

<h2>Your Wi-Fi Network Name</h2>

<p>Each Wi-Fi network needs a name. This name lets all of the wireless devices in your network communicate with one another through a wireless access point, the hotspot where your device connects to the system.</p>

<p>The SSID, or Service Set Identifier, is that name, a string of 32 characters often translated into a word or phrase for the sake of convenience. Each device in your network needs to share that name to stay connected. Your wireless access point broadcasts the SSID, your laptop picks it up and bingo, youre on board.</p>

<h2>So What about a BSSID? (Or, for That Matter, ESSID?)</h2>

<p>The BSSID, or Basic SSID, is another string of characters that defines your basic network structure  one wireless access point and one or more Wi-Fi devices. This more basic name is taken to the next level of complexity to create your SSID, which allows for more multifaceted networking.</p>

<p>If you want more than one wireless access point, you can use an ESSID, or Extended Service Set Identifier. You should realize, though, that these terms are often used interchangeably, with SSID commonly used to describe all three situations.</p>

<h2>Why Your SSID Is Important</h2>

<p>The world is full of wireless networks, and in any given area there may be a dozen that overlap. Your SSID makes sure your wireless devices are connected to your network.</p>

<p>Which brings us to choosing your SSID. Often, your SSID will be pre-set by the manufacturer of your network infrastructure. Thus, your SSID might be 
<em>linksys-g </em>or something similar. Trouble may arise, however, if a neighboring business is using the same name.</p>

<p>In such a case, you may want to choose your own SSID to prevent network overlap, one that perhaps reflects your company name or type of business.</p>

<h2>Network Security and Your SSID</h2>

<p>Creating a unique SSID for your business will help avoid accidental overlap with neighboring networks. This can add a small degree of security to your network, but you shouldnt rely on your SSID to keep you safe.</p>

<p>Even if your SSID is a secret, and even if you prevent your system from publicly broadcasting your SSID, hackers can use software to sniff out your network name and compromise your system. Critical information can thus fall into the wrong hands.</p>

<p>For better security, your business should implement network encryption capability, although even this might not keep out a determined hacker.</p>

<h2>Using Multiple SSIDs</h2>

<p>Another option for beefing up security is to use several SSIDs, a capability supported by much of the latest networking infrastructure. As such, you can use one SSID for open networking, in which the general public can access non-sensitive areas of your system, and another for internal processing of critical data. The appropriate level of security can thus be applied to each access point.</p>

<title>Extending Your Wireless Network Potential</title>
<description>Weak wireless signals are a real pain and interfere with running your business. But dont fret; there are effective and easy ways to expand your wireless potential.</description>

<p>Weak wireless signals are a real pain and interfere with running your business. But dont fret; there are effective and easy ways to expand your wireless potential.</p></blockquote>

<p>Frustrating, thats the word for it: when your wireless connection isnt as strong as it should be. When there are dead zones in certain parts of your building. When you are constantly losing your Wi-Fi connection.</p>

<p>A weak wireless signal is a common problem for many businesses, especially those housed in multi-story or oddly shaped buildings. But there are simple ways you can strengthen your wireless signal and expand its range. Some of these solutions involve moving your wireless router, while others may require the purchase of additional hardware.</p>

<h2>Correct Your Router Placement</h2>

<p>The instructions for your wireless routerthe hardware that distributes the Wi-Fi signal to your various computersprovide its signal range, 150 feet or so. However, this figure is the optimal range, and a number of factors can reduce it. The interference of walls, floors, filing cabinets or bookshelves can limit the useful range of your Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>If you experience a weak signal, look for obstacles that might cause interference and move your router away. While youre at it, make sure your router is centralized in your building.</p>

<h2>Centralize Your Router</h2>

<p>Routers distribute the Wi-Fi signal in an omnidirectional pattern  in every direction outward. To ensure that each part of your business receives the strongest signal, the router should be placed as centrally as possible. This may mean placing the router in the middle of the room or on a middle floor.</p>

<p>A common mistake in router placement is to locate it near an outer wall. The result is that half the Wi-Fi signal is directed outside, away from your computers.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Your Antenna</h2>

<p>Another way to make sure your Wi-Fi signal is going where it should is to replace your routers omnidirectional antenna with a high-gain, or unidirectional, antenna. This type of antenna distributes your signal where it is needed most.</p>

<h2>Change Your Wireless Channel</h2>

<p>Your wireless network has to compete with a lot of other signals coming from neighboring networks or from devices like cordless phones and microwaves. This interference can cause signal noise and reduce your wireless potential.</p>

<p>To reduce noise, try changing your wireless channel, as explained in your router instructions. You can also purchase cordless phones and other wireless appliances that use a different frequency from that of your Wi-Fi network.</p>

<h2>Add Wireless Repeaters</h2>

<p>If moving or reconfiguring your router doesnt increase signal strength, or there are still dead zones in your building, you may need to purchase a wireless repeater.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi repeaters are hardware that extends your wireless range by picking up the signal from your router, amplifying it and redistributing it. Place the repeater halfway between your router and your weak signal areas. Some buildings may require two or more repeaters for optimal networking.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Your Network</h2>

<p>The typical Wi-Fi network uses wireless-G hardware, an upgrade in strength from the previous wireless-B. If all efforts to increase your wireless potential have failed using your current system, consider making the switch to the newest hardware, wireless-N. Keep in mind that switching to a wireless-N router wont make any difference unless your computer adaptors are upgraded as well.</p>

<p>Weak signals are a real bother and interfere with running your business. No worries, though, a solution is readily at hand.</p>

<title>Microsoft Windows 8 Myths Debunked</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Any important software launch generates rumors and inaccurate reports, and Windows 8 isn't immune. Microsofts latest operating system has produced some interesting, and inaccurate, myths.</p></blockquote>

<p>The fast-approaching Windows 8 launch has sparked a flurry of excitement, speculation and good, old-fashioned doomsaying. Online commenters, never shy about airing their opinions, offer both praise and condemnation for the new operating system (OS). In such an environment, its perhaps unsurprising that Windows 8 myths abound. These myths include half-truths, carefully thought-out (but dead wrong) predictions, and one or two rumors that are off-the-charts insane. Here are a few of the more common misconceptions people have about Windows 8.</p>

<h2>The Death of the Start Button</h2>

<p>Yes, the familiar Windows Start button has indeed disappeared. That part of the myth is true. However, all the functions formerly accessed with the Start button are alive and well.</p>

<p>If you right-click on the lower left side of the screen you get a pop-up text menu that allows access to 
<strong>Programs and Features</strong>, the 
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, the 
<strong>Desktop</strong> and other features you used to find with the Start button. The functions are still there, even if the button has vanished.</p>

<h2>The Desktop Is Gone, Too!</h2>

<p>Its easy to see where this myth came from. Screenshots of the Windows 8 Start page show blocks of application tiles, which seem to have replaced the Desktop. If you check the app blocks, however, youll find that one of them actually
<em> is</em> your Desktop. Click on this block to open the Desktop.</p>

<h2>You Cant Close Open Apps</h2>

<p>This myth probably began because the app tiles dont have an obvious close option, but closing applications is fairly simple. All you need to do is position the mouse pointer in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. A sidebar appears that shows all active applications. Right-click the app you want closed and select 
<strong>Close</strong>.</p>

<h2>Forget the Apps, You Cant Even Power Down</h2>

<p>Okay, at this point the rumor mill starts to get silly. Really? Were expected to believe that Microsoft would design an operating system that needs a hard crash in order to shut off the computer?</p>

<p>This myth developed because Windows 8 changed the location and appearance of your power-off options. In the lower right-hand corner of the screen is a small box. Hover the mouse pointer over this box (or your finger, if youre using a touch screen) and the right-hand sidebar opens. This sidebar includes features such as 
<strong>Settings</strong>, 
<strong>Notifications</strong> and, of course, 
<strong>Power</strong>.</p>

<h2>Windows 8 Hates Mouse Users</h2>

<p>This was an inevitable myth. Microsoft designed Windows 8 to work with both touch screens and computer mice. Some people immediately decided this meant the company was throwing mouse users to the virtual wolves (or, this being the Internet, LOLcats).</p>

<p>The argument goes like this: Microsoft wants its piece of the tablet pie so they made Windows 8. If Windows 8 supports touch screens, then it must focus on touch-technology and ignore the needs of mouse users. This is despite Microsofts insistence that the operating system works well with both technologies, because, according the conspiracy theorists, you cant trust what 
<em>they</em> say.</p>

<p>To be fair, this is less a myth than an opinion. Mouse skills vary widely from user to user. If you have difficulty pointing, clicking and dragging items, then Windows 8 comes with a steep learning curve. You wont necessarily be using the mouse any more than you do with Windows 7; youll just be using it differently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Green computing is all the rage, but what does the term really mean?</p></blockquote>

<p>Being environmentally friendly isnt a trend, it's a major movement. And like other aspects of business, the IT world is greening up fast.</p>

<p>It seems that everywhere you look, green computing is being touted as the next big eco shift. Considering the reach of technology, its not surprising that IT would be ripe for green strategies. But what does green computing mean for small-business owners?</p>

<h2>Getting Definition</h2>

<p>Green computing is an umbrella term, referring to an eco-conscious way of developing, using and recycling technology, as well as utilizing resources in a more planet-friendly manner. Here are some key elements of green computing:</p>

<ul>

<li>Using energy-efficient hardware like notebook computers, displays, servers, printers and desktop computers.</li>

<li>Better use of resources, such as reduced paper consumption and lower energy utilization.</li>

<li>Greater awareness so that technology components dont end up in the waste stream.</li>

<li>Stronger environmental controls for technology production, leading to fewer toxic chemicals in the finished products.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, green computing works at all levels  development, manufacturing, usage and disposal  to minimize technologys impact on the global environment.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Green Computing</h2>

<p>For a small-business owner, it can feel satisfying to be employing more earth-friendly tactics, and there are even more advantages. Being more environmentally responsible can lead to that other green: cash in your pocket.</p>

<p>Green computing can help your wallet, since it creates a system of energy efficiency and lower utility costs.</p>

<p>For example, you can use notebook computers that are proven to be energy-efficient when compared to desktop computers. By putting an automatic power-down system in place for reducing energy consumption during periods of inactivity, you can save even more in energy costs. Then, if you also power-down peripherals like laser printers (which are notorious energy users), your energy usage drops even more.</p>

<p>With every green computing strategy, cost savings follow. And using fewer resources like this will extend the life of your systems, giving you better ROI and lowering your carbon footprint.</p>

<h2>A Growth Driver</h2>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency has reported that most small businesses can cut their energy costs by 30 percent, simply by employing more green-computing and energy-efficient strategies.</p>

<p>When you add the amount of savings that comes from extending the usage time frame of technology components, youre talking about some significant greenbacks.</p>

<p>What can you do with that unexpected windfall?</p>

<p>For many companies, finding that level of cost savings leads to more growth, either through hiring or through strategic initiatives that might otherwise have been impossible to fund.</p>

<p>Green computing promises strong ROI, but it goes beyond a better bottom line: The strategy is a growth driver that can benefit your business 
<em>and</em> your planet.</p>

<title>Forget Saving, Lets Make Money with Green Computing</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a future where homes and businesses dont just save energy, they produce it, too. Science fiction? Nope: thanks to the advent of "green computing" that scenario is likely to become increasingly common.</p></blockquote>

<p>Going green can help you save money and resources. But did you know that some homes and small businesses save so much energy, they sell it back to utility companies?</p>

<p>While these instances might be rare right now, theres potential for more companies and homeowners to become 
<em>producers</em> of energy, not just consumers.</p>

<p>True, the financial incentives are modest right now (unless youre converting a major chunk of land to wind power, that is). Nonetheless, the benefits are compelling, especially for businesses with high energy costs.</p>

<h2>Producer Power</h2>

<p>Companies and homes that significantly improve energy-efficiency practices can see an additional boost by using alternative and renewable energy sources. These sources harness natural forms of energy like wind, sunlight, rain or geothermal heat and turn them into electricity, heating, cooling and fuel.</p>

<p>You dont need to install a biomass boiler or turn your whole rooftop into a solar station, either. Just a few solar panels, a wind turbine or other renewable energy system can combine with lower power consumption to help tame those utility bills.</p>

<h2>Juiced-up Computing</h2>

<p>Green computing can play a major part of any energy-reduction strategy, since components and hardware involved in green computing implementations are more energy-efficient.</p>

<p>For example, data storage on smaller disk drives requires less power than traditional, larger drives. Although that might seem like a minor change, those types of shifts add up to big cost savings.</p>

<h2>An Energetic Future</h2>

<p>Currently, there are several bills in Congress calling for utility companies to institute net metering, a strategy that allows consumers to record how much energy is banked thanks to their green tactics. Already, though, all public electric utilities are required to make net metering available to those customers who ask.</p>

<p>The amount of compensation varies by state, according to power limits, monthly rollovers and other factors. States will pay their customers a retail rate for their energy. That could add up to a tidy revenue stream over time and boost ROI even more.</p>

<p>Other green computing practices like better power management, minimal paper use and proper disposal of e-waste can be blended to create a highly efficient business or home office. When coupled with the use of alternative energy, you're beginning to look greener than Kermit  and that can lead to some benefits from the power company.</p>

<p>Touch-screen capabilities may get all the hype, but a look at Windows 8 reveals that Microsofts latest offering makes significant changes to the old Windows formula.</p></blockquote>

<p>With Windows 8, Microsoft hopes to please both owners of touch-screen tablets and traditional mouse-and-keyboard users. Early evidence suggests that, against all expectations, the company might just pull it off. The general reaction to the new operating system has been positive, a bit of a surprise given how popular dissing Microsoft is among the tech community.</p>

<h2>Modern UI and Touch Screens</h2>

<p>The first thing you see when you log into Windows 8 is 
<strong>the Modern UI</strong>, a collection of brightly colored blocks (also called the Start Screen) each of which links to a different application. Swiping your finger along the screen moves you through the app list, and touching one opens the app in full screen. Swiping to the right of the screen brings up options such as 
<strong>Search</strong> and 
<strong>Share</strong>, and swiping to the left of the screen allows you to move from apps while in full-screen mode. Touch-tablet users will be able to resize, close and otherwise manipulate apps with intuitive finger movements.</p>

<p>Gone is the 
<strong>Start</strong> button from the lower left of your screen, but hovering the mouse over this location brings up the same list of current applications and allows the same functionality as the old button.</p>

<p>The Start Screen screen works well with touch screens. Some desktop PC users report that using a mouse in the Metro screen does not work as well: Its easy to swipe right past an app when using the mouse.</p>

<h2>Windows 8 Apps</h2>

<p>Exclusive Windows 8 apps will be available through the Windows Store, which Microsoft claims will have more oversight and security than Googles Android Market. Each app block displays information even when not in full screen. Windows 8 apps make it possible to share information over social-media sites and other online services. A glance at the Start Screen will show you Facebook and Twitter updates, new email and your calendar appointments for the day.</p>

<p>The Start Screen includes a Desktop box. Selecting this box will take you to a traditional Windows desktop, which youll need if you want to run programs such as Word, Paint or Outlook. Jumping between the Start Screen and the desktop isnt difficult, but it does add a new step for current Windows users.</p>

<title>Windows 8 Annoyances and Improvements</title>
<description>Windows 8 has its share of annoyances, but also improves on Windows 7 in several areas. Whether the improvements outweigh the operating systems shortcomings remains to be seen.</description>

<![CDATA[
<p>With the launch of the 
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview">Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a>, it became clear that Microsofts new operating system would be controversial. By trying to please touch-screen tablet users and traditional PC users, the operating system runs the risk of pleasing no one. Perhaps surprisingly, Windows 8 generally succeeds with this balancing act, but some areas need more work than others.</p>

<h2>Windows 8 Is for Sharing</h2>

<p>The ability to share information among multiple platforms and different accounts is one of Windows 8s most powerful features, and mostly it works very well. Synchronizing PC, laptop and smartphone settings is quick and easy, and the operating system allows users to customize what information is shared and what stays private.</p>

<p>The Metro apps allow users to monitor social-media sites, image-hosting sites and other online accounts at a glance through toasts, or streaming notifications. Features such as the Photo app allow users to access images in local folders, SkyDrive (an online storage site), Flickr and Facebook. One of Microsofts stated goals with Windows 8 is to facilitate information sharing, and the operating system certainly looks like it delivers.</p>

<h2>Built-in Protection</h2>

<p>Windows 8 comes with a built-in firewall, which is not a surprise, as Windows 7 had the same feature. The new operating system, however, adds antivirus protection to its Security Essentials program, including a feature protecting against malware in bootable USB drives. Presuming the new security features perform well, users may not need to install independent antivirus protection.</p>

<h2>One Browser, Two Versions</h2>

<p>Open Internet Explorer from the Metro apps and you get a browser that runs exclusively on HTML 5 and doesnt support Flash or website plug-ins. Access Internet Explorer from the Desktop, however, and you get a browser that supports plug-ins. If youre using Windows 8 on a portable device, this option could be quite helpful: An HTML 5 browser conserves battery power and provides a more secure browsing experience. PC users, however, may find it frustrating having to switch to the desktop to access the plug-in browser.</p>

<h2>Minor Annoyances</h2>

<p>One of the most common complaints leveled against the Windows 8 Consumer Preview is the lack of a tutorial. Boot up the operating system for the first time and youre dropped off at the Start
<strong> </strong>screen with no tutorial. Inconvenient, but its likely a tutorial will be added by launch day.</p>

<p>Viewing apps is a more serious annoyance. Apps cannot be resized, and always run full-screen. A left-hand sidebar displays open apps, but remembering which apps are running is a hassle. The ability to resize apps would greatly improve their functionality.</p>

<h2>Mouse or Finger?</h2>

<p>Windows 8 supports both touch-screen technology and traditional keyboard/mouse combinations. The consensus has been that the mouse works okay with Metro apps, but that the system favors touch screens.</p>

<p>Mouse users complain about unintuitive scroll-wheel commands with Metro apps. Moving the wheel moves the app right and left, rather than back and forth. While most people will adjust to this, this type of annoyance drives some users to distraction.</p>

<h2>Desktop Doldrums</h2>

<p>Critics charge that Windows 8 is pretty much Windows 7 with a flashy Metro app overlay. While this may be an exaggeration, the apps do seem better suited for tablet and smartphone use than PCs and laptops. PC users are likely to spend more time on the Desktop than the Metro screen.</p>

<p>With this in mind, why should PC users have to go through the Metro screen to reach the Desktop? Its been suggested that Windows 8 should allow users to choose between the Metro screen and the Desktop, either during installation or as an option in the PC Settings.</p>

<title>Peek Inside the Growing Windows 8 App Ecosystem</title>

<blockquote>
<p>The success of Windows 8 depends on its apps. With only a few months until the operating systems launch day, how strong is the Windows 8 app ecosystem?</p></blockquote>

<p>Microsofts Windows 8 App Store will play a significant role in determining whether Windows 8 succeeds or goes down like the 
<em>Titanic</em> at a glacier-calving convention. With launch day rapidly approaching, lets take a peek at the Windows 8 app ecosystem. Is it thriving or teetering on the edge of disaster?</p>

<h2>The Windows Store</h2>

<p>Users can access the Windows Store by clicking the Store icon in the top left-hand corner of the Start screen. The Store lists apps by Category, so you can browse through 
<strong>Games</strong>, 
<strong>Books and Reference</strong>, 
<strong>Productivity</strong>, and so on. The 
<strong>Top Free</strong> icon takes you to a list of the most popular free applications.</p>

<p>Clicking the tile of an app youre interested in brings up information about the app, including a description, a rating of up to five stars, a review tab and a recommended-age rating. Downloading the app is as simple as hitting the 
<strong>Install </strong>button.</p>

<p>A central app store increases user security. The Windows Store screens new apps for malicious or harmful software. If an app makes it to the Store, users can be pretty sure that it wont steal their credit-card numbers and run off for a three-day spending binge in Vegas.</p>

<p>When apps need updating, the Store Tile on the Start Screen displays the number of available updates in the bottom-right corner of the tile. In the Store itself, update reminders appear in the top right of the screen. Clicking these reminders takes users to an update screen where they can decide which updates to install.</p>

<h2>Windows 8 App Numbers</h2>

<p>
<em>Forbes</em> Magazine looked at the state of the Windows 8 Store in April 2012, a few months before the operating system's expected launch date. The magazine reported only 99 apps available in the Store. That number pales in comparison to the 1,000 apps available to the iPad at launch, but its better than the mere 50 tablet-specific apps Android offered at launch.
<strong></strong></p>

<p>Microsoft needs more apps by launch date if it hopes to compete with the iPad, which boasted over 180,000 apps as of February 2012. Social, productivity and video apps are especially lacking. By April 2012, the Windows 8 Store had only four social apps available.</p>

<p>On a more positive note, Android, which launched with a piddling 50 apps, now has 32,000 available apps, so Microsoft could make up lost ground quickly as more developers come on board.</p>

<p>
<em>Forbes</em> also notes that in addition to Metro apps, Microsoft has a staggering four million desktop apps, including 800,000 Windows 7 apps that will run on X36 versions of Windows 8  specifically laptops and desktops. The ability to run legacy Windows 7 apps on PCs may give Microsoft some time to beef up its Metro apps collection. Tablets and smartphones, which run on newer ARM processors, will be able to run all Metro apps and any new desktop apps designed for Windows 8.</p>

<p>Right now, the Windows 8 apps ecosystem looks healthy, but perhaps not robust enough to compete against an established player like the iPad. The apps available in the Windows 8 Store are, largely, well designed and functional, but the marketplace lacks variety.</p>

<p>Which cloud services are ideal for small businesses? Its hard to say, but certain traits do lend themselves well to the cloud. What are they?</p></blockquote>

<p>Cloud services work particularly well for small shops in certain situations.</p>

<p>Here are a few:
<strong></strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Youre a small shop facing increased demand for your products or services, but youre not equipped to expand your IT setup.</li>

<li>You have consistent access to secure Wi-Fi, minimizing the risks of cloud computing on the road.</li>

<li>The data youd keep in the cloud is proprietary only to your company  you dont have the added risk of liability for customers private or financial data in the event of a security breach.</li>

<li>Your business could continue operating during downtime if you lost access to the cloud for an hour  or even a day.</li>

<li>Youd benefit from the clouds scalability as your business fluctuates.</li>

<li>Youre already in the market for new software or IT services.</li>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Technology problems can cripple a small businesss productivity. Imagine an office in which technology is worry-free, giving you more time to perform tasks that make your business profitable. </span></p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">People have a fascination with mythical and legendary places: Atlantis, Shangri-La, Avalon and the Lost Empire of Mu. Explorers spend lifetimes searching for proof that such places exist. Failure can mean ridicule, death and exorbitant travel expenses, but fame and fortune await the discoverers of such lands.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Small-business owners search for their own Shangri-La, the perfect office  a magical place where technology helps rather than hinders. A place where trouble-shooting technology never sidetracks productive work. Perfection may not be possible, but we can dream. What features would make up the perfect office?</span></p>

<h2>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Securing the Borders</span></h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Even the most utopian of offices must guard against invaders. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance, and all that stirring stuff. The small-business office needs strong virtual borders to defend against data theft, malware and the legal consequences of data breaches.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Your weapons of choice are familiar names; security suites such as McAfee and Norton combine antivirus protection with built-in firewalls. Dont assume youre immune to hacking or spyware if you run Macs instead of PCs; even mighty Atlantis sank. Mac-specific spyware and viruses exist and will become more common as Macs increase in popularity. Products such as Integos Internet Security Barrier protect Mac systems, and are quite affordable.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Security suites need regular updates to stay current on the latest threats. Most suites allow you to schedule updates and system scans, so you dont have to do these tasks manually. Just set a regular update system and forget about it.</span></p>

<h2>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Avoiding a Backup Backlog</span></h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Legend says that elephants, knowing that its their time to die, seek out elephant graveyards. Legend also says that hard drives, knowing that their time has come, wait until the week you forget to back up your files.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Youve got several options for backing up vital information. Small, external storage devices can store more than 500 GB of information, and can easily be slipped into a pocket or briefcase (and on the downside, such devices can also slip </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">
<em>out</em></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> of pockets and briefcases). Larger external drives can store terabytes of information. Most external storage connects to your computer via USB ports.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Networked attached storage (NAS) devices are external storage devices with their own operating systems. The NAS device connects to your computer network, and it has the advantage that any network computer can connect to the device (for more on NAS, check out the Staples Tech article, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/what-is-nas-network-attached-storage.html">"What is NAS"</a>).
</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Cloud storage provides yet another backup option. Many cloud providers offer a certain amount of storage free, and you only need to pay if you need additional storage. Such services also allow you to schedule regular backups during off-work hours, so you can back up data on a daily basis.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Cloud storages great strength is also its greatest weakness. All your information stays online, and you can access it from any computer or mobile device. On the downside, all your information is online, so if you lose Internet access, you cant access your data.</span></p>

<p>
<strong>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Finding IT Support</span></strong></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Home offices and small businesses can rarely afford dedicated IT support. A full-time IT staff member simply isnt financially viable. So when IT problems crop up (as they inevitably do), your business grinds to a standstill.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">IT consultants provide small businesses with IT support on an as-needed basis. You could hire an IT consultant to come in and set up automated backup software for your wireless network, new printers, or voice-over-the-Internet (VoIP) services.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Remote IT support is another option for the small business trying to balance finances with efficiency. Online IT support can, with your permission, remotely access your device to perform diagnostic tests. The company then walks you through fixing the problem. If youre interested in learning even more about remote IT support and other tech services, feel free to </span>

<h2>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Productivity Software</span></h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The perfect office automates as many tasks as possible. Take email campaigns as an example. A well-designed email marketing campaign requires time and effort to put into motion and maintain. Software such as Constant Contact provides multiple email templates and tools that help you get your message into customers inboxes without conflicting with spam filters. The application also offers tools for making and evaluating online surveys or running social media campaigns.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Don't overlook the Microsoft Office suites timesaving features. Microsoft Outlook can merge information from emails, appointments and documents. Multiple users can access Outlook calendars and share contact information, making the software a good choice for in-office use.</span></p>

<h2>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Communication Options</span></h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Communication possibilities abound for the small-business office. Voice-over-the-Internet (VoIP) services such as Vonage and Skype allow you to communicate via chat, Internet phone services, or video conferencing. If you have a webcam and microphone, you can have face-to-face meetings with clients and off-site employees without losing work time to travel, and basic VoIP services are often free.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Membership in such services increases your communication options. Internet phone services can connect directly to your landline, saving you long-distance calls. Some VoIP services also offer applications for cell phones, so you can use VoIP instead of eating into your monthly minute allowance.</span></p>

<h2>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Tablets and Smartphones</span></h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Some say you carry your home with you, and with the advent of smartphones and tablets, you can carry your office with you as well. Smartphones, with their ability to access email and the Internet, mean you can connect to the office whenever you want.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Tablets offer even more versatility, adding basic word processing and e-reader capabilities to the mix. More importantly, you can use tablets for on-the-spot multimedia presentations without having to carry around larger notebooks. </span></p>

<h2>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Virtual Assistants</span></h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">How much time do you spend scheduling meetings, answering emails or engaging in tedious and repetitive tasks? If youre a one-person business, the answer is probably too much time. Many a small-business owner spends several hours a week performing work that, in larger companies, would be delegated to an administrative assistant.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">You may object that you couldnt possibly afford an admin assistant to work in-office, but thanks to the Internet, the perfect office has no physical boundaries. Virtual assistants are admin support who, like many business owners, telecommute. You communicate with the assistant online, assigning him or her whatever tasks eat into your productivity. Remote email management is one of the larger, more important tasks that many small business owners will delegate to an online assistant or service. For a real-world example of this practice in action, you need not look any farther than author Tim Fersiss, who uses a virtual assistant as part of </span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/01/21/the-holy-grail-how-to-outsource-the-inbox-and-never-check-email-again/">his four-hour work week.</a></span></span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Type virtual assistant into Google and you'll find many websites where VAs offer their services for a fraction of the price you pay for in-office help. As with any employee, you have to interview each VA carefully, as not all VAs have the same standards. A good virtual assistant, however, can provide you with excellent support while you focus on more important elements of your business rather than answering emails.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Does the perfect small-business office exist? Perhaps not, but with today's tech solutions you can come close to claiming this mythical land for your own</span></p>

<title>Embrace Cloud Computing or Get Out of the Way</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Cloud computing is the future of small-business technology  are you taking advantage of it?</p></blockquote>

<p>Cloud computing has received plenty of hype in recent years. Now its starting to live up to its promise  and companies that don't take advantage of cloud services are in danger of falling behind.</p>

<p>While cloud computing is on the rise, it initially suffered from sluggish adoption (for more about the basics of cloud computing, please read our comprehensive 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/cloud-services-crash-course-2/your-head-in-the-clouds-first-flight-into-cloud-services.html">cloud computing intro guide</a>). Of course, many other major technologies that are now commonplace (e.g., e-books, smartphones and even the Internet itself) took the same slow path to prominence. (Need a refresher on cloud computing? Check out our 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/cloud-services-guide-and-glossary.html">Cloud Services Guide and Glossary</a>.) `</p>

<p>Early cloud efforts are similar to the e-book story in many ways. Although products like Amazons Kindle and Barnes &amp;amp; Nobles Nook are seen on nearly every bus and subway car in the United States these days, the e-book wasnt so quick to catch on at first.</p>

<p>In 1992, Sony launched its Data Discman, which allowed readers to buy books stored on CDs. A few years later, the NuvoMedia Rocket eBook also failed to create a market for electronic books. It took about 15 years for the concept of e-books to transition from visionary idea to mainstream adoption.</p>

<p>Similarly, early cloud-computing efforts were more about the promise of the technology than the implementation. The concept for the cloud actually dates back 50 years, to when computer scientist John McCarthy noted that computing could someday be presented as a public utility.</p>

<p>It wasnt until Amazon took a chance on updating its data centers with cloud- computing capability, however, that the theoretical turned into the realistic. The company began offering cloud computing to its enterprise customers, and other providers started to develop tools and networks that could provide cloud computing and storage on a large scale.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/03/open-source-virtualization-technology-cloud-computing.html">Writing for Forbes in 2010</a>, technology columnist Margaret Lewis noted, I dont think there is even a question: cloud computing is here to stay.</p>

<h2>Abundant Benefits for Your Business</h2>

<p>Like any technology shift, moving to the cloud requires some changes to a companys processes. An organization may find itself needing hardware upgrades, IT consulting, better networking capability and stronger security measures. Considering the advantages of cloud computing, such a major revamp is generally worth the effort.</p>

<p>Cloud computing delivers computing resources as a service. So instead of buying multiple software applications and infrastructure components, a company can share these resources with other cloud-service users. This produces a number of business benefits, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Scalability.</strong> Your business can increase and reduce storage depending on need, not on hardware and software availability. You can expand and contract operations more easily, without being saddled by additional hardware costs. An e-commerce site, for instance, may need more computing resources for the holiday season and scale way back in the summer. Cloud computing makes this possible.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Security.</strong> For smaller companies in particular, keeping up with the type of automated updates required for security can be daunting. Every application and piece of hardware needs updating at some point. With a cloud-based strategy, you don't have to worry about those schedules because cloud providers do those updates instead.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Access. </strong>Cloud computing depends on a networked infrastructure, so you can access services from remote locations. All you need is an Internet connection.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Recovery.</strong> Data recovery can be easier when data is stored in a cloud-based service  especially if a companys offices or server rooms are damaged. Power loss, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding and other disasters could cause a frightening amount of damage to an onsite technology-storage closet. But when company resources and data are stored in a cloud, theyre better protected.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Ease of use.</strong> Early iterations of cloud-based services may have required some major IT skills. These days, however, cloud companies can guide you through the process with ease. Companies can carry out cloud strategies for data backup and application usage in a way thats intuitive and straightforward. Best of all, theyve gotten far better at customer support, so you can get the advice you need.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Looking Toward the Future</h2>

<p>While every executive must determine whether cloud computing is an appropriate strategy for his or her business, cloud services will play a role in the future of most companies.</p>

<p>Already, many enterprises use the cloud without even realizing it. Vendors may be backing up data about deals to cloud-based storage, for example. Sales reps, marketing professionals and finance execs, too, may be accessing certain applications via the cloud.</p>

<p>Using more cloud services can level the playing field for many businesses. A small firm in a rural location can have the same tools and resources as a large corporation in the heart of New York City. That gives companies of every size the clout they need  at affordable rates  to compete with much larger competitors.</p>

<p>The cloud may have started in the hype cycle that dooms some newer technology, but at this point, it clearly has staying power. So it may be time for your company to make a move to a cloud-based strategy  and reap the benefits of living in the cloud.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>We cant seem to have a conversation about business or technology these days without referencing the cloud. But how many people are familiar with the clouds history? And do you know what cloud services could do for your small business?</p>

<p>Cloud computing has actually been around for longer than you might guess  50 years or so. In the 1960s, J. C. R. Licklider introduced the idea of an intergalactic computer network, and John McCarthy suggested, in a speech at MIT, that computing might one day be sold as a utility, like electricity or water.</p>

<p>Now, after decades on the perimeter, cloud computing is really trending  and for good reason. Were creating and processing enormous amounts of data every day, and high-speed data networks and virtualization have made the technology more reliable. For small businesses, cloud services can keep processes sound and efforts efficient.</p>

<h2>Getting to Know Cloud Services</h2>

<p>What kinds of services are we talking about? You can invest in cloud services at three different levels:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): </strong>With IaaS, the provider gives you a virtual computer  raw storage, firewalls, load balancers and networks. You install the operating system (OS) and application software on your machine, and you maintain each. Wide area connectivity relies on the Internet or, in carrier clouds, on virtual private networks. Rates typically depend on how much storage you need.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS): </strong>PaaS offers you a platform stack that can include the OS, programming language, execution environment, database and Web server. You dont have to buy or manage the underlying hardware or software. Some PaaS systems automatically scale users computing and storage resources, which means you dont have to bother with manual allocation. Rates and fee scales are very much in flux, so be sure to do your research before committing to a contract.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Software as a Service (SaaS): </strong>The SaaS provider installs and operates application software in the cloud; you access it through a cloud client. Theres no need to install and run the application on your machine. Since you dont manage the infrastructure or platform, you dont worry about maintenance or support. Typically, you pay a flat fee per user.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Starting Small: Storing Your Stuff in the Cloud
<strong></strong></h2>

<p>Online storage can be a smart, affordable entrée to cloud computing, whether youre looking to free up storage space on your system, back up files offsite or both. Its a popular element of cloud computing, and new services are popping up every day  some with a specific focus, like email or digital photo storage.</p>

<p>Most online storage services allow you to store a limited amount of data at little or no cost. Your fees increase with the amount of storage you need.</p>

<p>Cloud services are gaining ground fast, in part because people are discovering how much the cloud can help small businesses. With more providers offering a range of services, now could be the right time to make them work for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ready to go cloud surfing? Take a look at these questions first, so you know what to ask cloud providers.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">From one-man bike shops to 10-person staffing firms, small businesses everywhere are talking about the cloud and its potential to lower costs.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Learn how the cloud can help you spend less time under the desk performing shoestring repairs on your PC  and free up more time for mission-critical activities, like generating leads. Here are the top 10 questions that small shops need to ask before taking flight into the cloud:</span></p>

<h2>1. How much will it cost?</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">As with any other technology issue, the answer to this one is: it depends. The first step is to determine all the potential costs, so ask cloud providers for a list of every possible expense that could crop up. Common expenses include data-storage costs; one-time fees for moving data; uploads and downloads; general network bandwidth fees; and maintenance costs. Fortunately, most cloud providers will give you a free quote and work with you on pricing, making it easier to compare providers.</span></p>

<h2>2. What do I need to know about security?</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Cloud computing creates certain security issues because it requires different levels of configuration and management, for both software and hardware. That means there are risks, but it also means there are distinctive strategies for protection. Your cloud provider should be able to go over the tactics needed to keep your data safe, including encryption, identity management and physical security. Every cloud provider has a data-recovery and business-continuity plan in place, so ask about these when you're shopping around.</span></p>

<h2>3. What can be outsourced to the cloud?</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Most small businesses use the cloud for data backup (including both short-term storage and long-term archiving), but application-based operations can also be outsourced. For example, if you want to use customer relationship management (CRM) software, you could tap into a cloud providers CRM apps instead of paying for per-desk licensing and other fees.</span></p>

<h2>4. Will I need extra IT help to make the transition?</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Most likely, you won't need to hire a technology guru, but having some IT help can make the process simple, efficient and speedy. Many outsourced IT professionals have worked with numerous small-business customers, so they know the types of issues that can arise. Plus, theyre familiar with strategies for getting you into the cloud with minimal hassle. An IT partner also can help you take advantage of all the services a cloud provider offers and provide vendor-neutral advice.</span></p>

<h2>5. Do I have to purchase new hardware?</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Maybe. Sometimes, a network needs to be optimized for cloud-computing services, and that can involve purchasing newer desktop or laptop machines. But most companies can take advantage of cloud offerings without making a substantial investment.</span></p>

<h2>6. How can I determine whether its right for my business?</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Heres where a deep dive into costs and benefits can come in handy. Get a grasp of any cloud-related expenses (e.g., hardware upgrades, monthly fees and outsourced IT consulting), and then compare those numbers to what it might cost to run the same level of computing power in-house. Many companies find they save money through cloud computing because they dont have to revamp their infrastructure and hire additional IT staff to realize productivity gains. Be sure to look at other issues, too, such as whether cloud-based backup will be a disruption to your business instead of a benefit.</span></p>

<h2>7. What do I need to do to get ready for the cloud?</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Depending on your business, getting ready could be as simple as having an outsourced IT consultant come to your company and make the changes necessary for automatic backup. There could also be more extensive preparations, such as optimizing hardware for faster bandwidth or training staff members in uploading to a cloud provider.</span></p>

<h2>8. How can I make sure I always have access to my data?</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">A cloud provider should be able to outline access, security, services, support and other specifics in a service-level agreement. These agreements detail what happens if theres an outage or if the cloud provider goes out of business, and protects you in certain circumstances. To be truly confident about data storage, however, experts usually recommend using multiple services instead of a single provider. Some companies, for instance, choose to back up mission-critical data to a cloud provider as well as to a different online backup service.</span></p>

<h2>9. Is there anything a cloud provider cant provide?</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">One of the few things cloud providers generally cant deliver is guaranteed uptime. Some come very close, promising 99.99 percent uptime, but very few offer 100 percent. That doesnt necessarily mean youll experience downtime at some point; it just means you should have a plan in place in case you are ever faced with downtime.</span></p>

<h2>10. What happens in the event of data loss?</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Much like the answer for costs, we go back to this: it depends. Encrypted data that gets corrupted can be harder to recover, but it's not impossible. Your cloud provider will have a policy in place in the event of data loss, which outlines the recovery measures theyll take. Make sure to ask the provider about these strategies before any loss occurs, and try to get some examples of how theyve recovered data in the past.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">These answers should get you thinking about cloud computing and what it takes to propel your business toward the cloud. The biggest advantage: you may never have to crawl under that desk again. </span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Want a faster, safer, more efficient computer? Dont buy a new one, use these tools already installed on your current PC instead.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Heres a silly question: If you could enhance the performance of your PC  using tools </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">
<em>already</em></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> installed on your computer  would you do it? Of course you would.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">With a few easy-to-use applications that came prepackaged on your PC, you can make your computer run faster and more efficiently, protect yourself from malware and increase your privacy while browsing the Internet. Soon you can enjoy better computing by using these tools for Windows and Internet Explorer.</span></p>

<h2>Enhancing Speed and Performance</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Have you noticed your PC isnt running as quickly as it once did? Does it take longer to start up? Do your applications seem sluggish? Is web browsing slower than usual? If so, you may need to use these tools to give your PC a tune-up.</span></p>

<h2>Defrag Your Hard Drive</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Your computer has a strange habit: Sometimes your PC will break files into different parts and then store these file fragments in separate areas of your hard drive. Your PC does this for efficiency, but as the files update and multiply, the retrieving and rebuilding of these files when you need to use them becomes more work for your computer. Thus, your PC slows down.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">To put the file fragments back together and help your PC run more efficiently, you will need to run your Disk Defragmenter tool. This tool is found on your </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Control Panel</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> under </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Administrator Tools</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">. Note that you will need to be signed into your PC as an administrator to use this and the following tools.</span></p>

<h2>Remove Disk Errors</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Every once in a while, a program on your PC will crash or you will experience a power outage. The result of such an event is often errors on your hard drive, errors that result in a slower PC. To repair these errors and improve performance, run the </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Check Disk</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> tool, which is found on your </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Control Panel</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">.</span></p>

<h2>Remove Temp Files</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Your PC is a bit of a hoarder. Each time you surf the Web, your computer stores temporary files on your hard disk that make Web-page loading faster. Also, when you use programs like Word, your PC keeps many temporary files to ensure that you dont lose important data. Eventually the sheer bulk of these files adds up, and they slow down your computer.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">To rid your PC of these unnecessary, temporary files, use the </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Disk Cleanup</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> tool.</span></p>

<h2>Manage Startup Applications</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Some software applications may be set to start automatically whenever you turn on your PC. This can be useful for programs you consult frequently, but too many programs running automatically can cause startup delays. Use </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Windows Defender</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> in your </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">All Programs</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> list to limit your startup applications.</span></p>

<h2>Remove Malware from Your PC</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Spyware, viruses, adware you can hardly surf the Web these days without running into them. And if you do contract some of this malware, not only can it compromise your personal privacy and information, it can reduce your PCs performance. As these applications run in the background of your PC, they take up processing power, leading to slowdowns.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Many people have already purchased an anti-malware program, but those who havent can download </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Microsoft Security Essentials</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> for free. This tool removes existing malware from your PC and prevents further infections.</span></p>

<h2>Enhancing PC Privacy</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Maintaining your privacy is important when surfing the Web. Keeping your critical data hidden from hackers can thwart identity theft and financial loss. Hackers are also keen on tracking the Web sites you visit, keeping tabs on pages viewed and even 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/tech-articles/what-is-keylogging.html">recording each keystroke you make while there.</a> </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Such keystroke trackers can reveal your passwords to hackers.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Weve already discussed the 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/the-modern-malware-threat-2/the-modern-malware-threat.html">use of anti-malware programs</a>,</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> but there are a few other utilities packaged into Internet Explorer that can enhance your PC privacy while you use the Internet.</span></p>

<h2>InPrivate Browsing</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">This Internet Explorer tool allows you to surf the Web without your PC storing data about your browsing session. Information such as history, cookies and temporary files is not collected, keeping this data from being usable by hackers. You can access this tool through the </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Safety </span></p>

<h2>Tracking Protection</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Many of the Web pages that you visit include content from third-party sources. For instance, you may be viewing an online gardening encyclopedia, but advertisements from gardening retailers are in the sidebar. In such cases, your browsing data is sent to the folks who run the encyclopedia and also those third-party retailers. In this way, these retailers can store and use your data for their own purposes.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Although many of these third parties are benign, some are not. For this reason, another Internet Explorer tool, </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Tracking Protection</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, can be enabled to weed out trouble sites and keep them from collecting your information. Lists of sites known to be malicious can be downloaded </span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="http://www.iegallery.com/en-US/trackingprotectionlists">from Microsoft</a></span></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and added to Tracking Protection, or you can add your own sites to the list.</span></p>

<h2>SmartScreen Filter</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Some hackers set up Web pages that are made to mimic the appearance of other sites. They may create pages that look like your banks Web site to try to coax you into giving up passwords or account information. Or, these pages may appear to offer free downloads of popular programs, which instead download malware to your PC when you click Install</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">SmartScreen Filter</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> available with Internet Explorer detects these scam sites and blocks the pages from loading.</span></p>

<h2>Other Internet Options</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">If you click the </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Tool</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> icon on the Internet Explorer toolbar and choose </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Internet Options</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> from the drop-down list, you will see there are other tools available to enhance your security and privacy while surfing the Web.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">On the </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Security tab</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, you can set the level of protection to be used while you surf. You may wish to lower or heighten this level depending on the kind of browsing you do. You can also specify lists of trusted and restricted sites.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Under the </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Privacy tab</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> you can set your personal privacy level (Accept All Cookies; Medium; Block All Cookies). This is also the place to turn on the Explorer pop-up blocker</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">, which prevents pop-up advertisements from opening while you surf the Web.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Finally, under the </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Content tab</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, the types of Web content that can be viewed while surfing can be controlled. This is where you will find options for parental controls as well.</span></p>

<h2>Rate Your PCs Performance</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Once youve used this handy list of tools to soup up your computer, find out just how well your PC is performing. The </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Windows Experience Index</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> tool, found on your </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Control Panel</span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">, gives your computer an efficiency rating.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">By measuring such things as CPU and disk drive performance, the Windows Experience Index lets you know how your computer stacks up against other PCs out there. This indicates whether you need a memory or processing upgrade to perform the functions and run the software you want on your PC.</span></p>

<p>Some people mistakenly expect that switching from a 32-bit to 64-bit system doubles the speed of a machine. Thats not quite true, but there are some significant advantages:</p>

<ul>

<li>64-bit systems can access more than 17 billion GB of system memory, compared to only 4 GB for a 32-bit system.</li>

<li>64-bit systems allow data to be processed in larger chunks, increasing efficiency.</li>

<li>64-bit systems
<strong> </strong>address or point to more locations at once, improving multitasking.</li>

<li>While many software applications are 32-bit, new processors are typically 64-bit.</li>

<li>Most 32-bit applications work fine on 64-bit Windows, though antivirus programs and device drivers can be incompatible.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>More and more businesses are connecting to customers through Facebook. Its a great tool, but dont fall prey to Facebook malware.</p></blockquote>

<p>Facebook is a great tool. Thats the first thing to remember. The fact that cyber-criminals are targeting Facebook users in increasing numbers, and uploading dangerous malware
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> to their computers, doesnt mean you need to close your account.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">But you do need to use your head. With a bit of common sense and the right malware protection, your business can keep using Facebook to connect with customers.</span></p>

<h2>The Nature of the Threat</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Computer hackers are getting smarter. They have taken advantage of the popularity of Facebook to spread their evil ways. By luring unsuspecting users to click suspicious links and download tainted apps, the hackers are infecting thousands of computers with viruses and spyware. Some of this malware can steal your personal or company information, including passwords.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Often the bad links appear to be shared by your Facebook friends. A hacker will log in as a friend and then share the link on your wall, which routes you to a site where the malware is active. You might be prompted to run an application or update some common software, and thats when the malware strikes.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Tricky, huh? Yet most of these attacks can be avoided.</span></p>

<h2>Avoiding Facebook Malware</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Avoiding these threats starts with a healthy dose of skepticism. Links that purport to take you to sensational news stories or expose the secrets of Facebook should be treated with suspicion. This is especially true if the addresses are in an abbreviated form, using services such as bit.ly. These shortened addresses are often used to disguise the true target of the link. Services are available that reveal where the links point (e.g., </span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="http://longurl.org/">Long URL</a></span></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"> and </span>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
<a href="http://urlxray.com/">URL X-ray</a></span></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">).</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">If you do click one of these links, </span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">
<em>never </em></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">accept prompts to download apps or updates to software, and certainly dont give away personal or business information. If your software needs to be updated, do it through the manufacturers website or your IT department.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">You might think it cynical to distrust a post that appears to come from a friend or a reputable software or news source, but a bit of skepticism now can save many headaches later.</span></p>

<h2>Update Your Virus Protection</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">The makers of your antivirus software are working hard to protect you, but the hackers are working hard, too. Each year, thousands of new viruses are unleashed on the world, and you need the latest in antivirus updates to avoid them. Update your firewall protection as well.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Much of the newest antivirus software is designed to work with Facebook, checking links and apps for trouble before you click them or pass them on to friends. Investing in these packages is well worth it.</span></p>

<h2>Getting Rid of Facebook Malware</h2>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">If you do come down with a case of malware, the faster you get rid of it, the better. This can save you from both extensive computer damage and passing it on to friends.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">If youve contracted an infected Facebook app, you can go to your Privacy Settings and delete the app. You can also mark bad wall posts as spam. Both measures protect you while on Facebook.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">If the malware has gotten into your computer, youll have to run your repair software. Should the damage be extensive, enlist the services of a virus professional.</span></p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Remember: Steering clear of malware starts with you. </span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you thinking about adding RAM to your PC? Learn the ins and outs before you make the investment.</p></blockquote>

<p>With random access memory (RAM) prices falling fast, you may be considering memory upgrades for your office desktops and laptops. But before you take the next step, make sure you know the exact amount and type of RAM that will suit your needs.</p>

<h2>Determining Your Memory Needs</h2>

<p>Getting the right RAM for your machine begins with knowing the type of operating system (OS) youre running  and how much RAM it can support. A 64-bit OS like Windows 7 can handle large amounts of RAM effectively, while a 32-bit version of Windows can only support up to 3.5 GB. If youre not sure which OS you have, go to 
<strong>Start &amp;gt; Control Panel &amp;gt; System Properties</strong>.</p>

<p>Another way to retrieve details about your machines memory is to download a free online program like the 
<a href="http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/">Crucial System Scanner</a>, which scans your hardware and produces a detailed report. Staples EasyTech also offers a diagnostic service for PCs that can be conducted in the home office or in-store.</p>

<p>A third option: Go to
<strong> Ctrl+Alt+Delete &amp;gt; Task Manager &amp;gt; Performance </strong>to see how much memory youre using. Also, consult your operating manual for details about the amount and type of RAM thats right for your machine.</p>

<h2>Different Types of RAM</h2>

<p>Your system scanner, operating manual or EasyTech associate will let you know which types of RAM are appropriate for your laptop or PC. Here are four common varieties:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Dynamic random access memory (DRAM)</strong> stores bits in memory cells that require constant refreshing.</li>

<li>
<strong>Synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM)</strong> synchronizes DRAM with the microprocessors clock speed for faster performance.</li>

<li>
<strong>Double data rate (DDR) SDRAM</strong> uses a higher bandwidth for even greater speed.</li>

<li>
<strong>Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor RAM (
<strong>CMOS RAM)</strong> </strong>relies on a small battery to store the information your computer needs to boot up.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Memory Upgrade Process</h2>

<p>Once youve determined the amount and type of RAM to add, the physical act of upgrading is pretty easy.</p>

<p>RAM comes in little sticks, called modules, which slip into designated slots in your computer. They are typically available in 1 GB, 2 GB and 4 GB sizes.</p>

<p>To replace or add a RAM stick, start by opening the casing of your machine with a screwdriver and locating the memory slots on the computer's motherboard (look for two or four side-by-side slots). Then, simply slide the new stick into place. Along the way, be sure to follow the manufacturers instructions and use a grounding strap.</p>

<p>Our technology trained associates can guide you through a memory upgrade or even perform it for you with a quick turnaround. Done right, adding memory can really boost your machines performance  particularly if youre running resource-intensive applications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Social media can be a boon for businesses, but it also comes with risks. Protect your company with some simple security measures.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the Web, theres no place to hide.</p>

<p>That's how it seems, with weekly reports of hacked social-media accounts that uncover all the secrets (and more than a few photos) of celebrities and politicians.</p>

<p>Its not just well-known people who are getting hacked, either. An 
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2046045/Third-teens-say-theyve-Facebook-Twitter-accounts-hacked-into.html">MTV/Associated Press poll</a> finds that about 30 percent of teens and young adults have had their Twitter, Facebook, email or other accounts exposed.</p>

<p>That age group tends to use fewer protection measures, putting them more at risk. But every individual and business should follow good security practices to keep their information safe.</p>

<p>
<strong>Anatomy of a Hack</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, someone you know does the hacking, such as a disgruntled former employee or romantic partner. A University of Michigan quarterback recently took down his Twitter feed after an ex-girlfriend began tweeting about how he cheated during their relationship.</p>

<p>Like other security threats, social-media hacks are done to gain access to personal information. However, they arent always done to settle old scores. For businesses that are exposed, the breach can lead to revenue for the hacker.</p>

<p>For example, worming their way into a companys Facebook account by guessing an easy password can give hackers access to any linked social-media accounts, additional passwords and company information.</p>

<p>
<strong>Protect Yourself</strong></p>

<p>Increasingly, businesses are relying on social media as part of their marketing and sales strategies, so staying protected on these sites is crucial. Here are some tips on locking down and keeping the bad guys out:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Use strong password protection.</strong> Create a complex password featuring a combination of letters, numbers and symbols. Only share the password with trusted individuals, and change the password on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Look before you leap. </strong>Before posting on Facebook or tweeting on Twitter, take a moment to think about what someone else could do with that information. Most of the time, the content will be safe. But try to get into the mind of a hacker for a second, and consider what could be mined from what you post. Information like your current location and the identities and faces of your family members are all items that can be gleaned from unsecured or ill-moderated social-media profiles.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Choose apps carefully. </strong>Be very careful about installing third-party applications, sometimes referred to as Facebook apps. These applications will often prompt you with messages that ask for access to your account. Before accepting these terms, always research the background of the application. A simple keyword search on Google is often all youll need to learn more about the application in question (examples of safe apps are Instagram and Twitter).</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Set appropriate privacy and security defaults.</strong> Often, the default settings for applications arent enough to protect you. Take the time to look through privacy settings and make sure theyre set at a high level.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Consider everything you post as public.</strong> Even with strong security and privacy settings, information and photos can still be accessed. Talk to employees about keeping their postings appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to social-media protection, prevention is key. Use the Web as a source of connection and brand-building, but make sure that you and your companys good name are safe.</p>

<title>New Malware Threats Take Shape in 2012</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Think malware can only infect your PC? Think again. Malware is moving to mobile. Mobile malware threats include information theft and hijacked SMS services.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<strong>New Malware Threats Take Shape in 2012</strong></p>

<p>Users associate malware with desktop operating systems, but malicious programs also target mobile devices. Over the course of 2011, mobile malware became increasingly common, a trend that appears to continue in 2012.</p>

<p>
<strong>Malware Attacks in 2011</strong></p>

<p>Malware hit Android devices hard in 2011. The 
<a href="http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Security-Mobility-Now/Juniper-Mobile-Security-Report-2011-Unprecedented-Mobile-Threat/ba-p/129529">Juniper Networks Mobile Threat Center</a> reported a staggering 3,325 percent increase in Android malware in the last half of the year.</p>

<p>The sharp rise in Android malware reflects that Android devices currently dominate the market, and offer the maximum potential profit to cybercriminals. Other operating systems also saw an increase in mobile malware attacks, although not to the same extent as Android:</p>

<ul>

<li>Blackberry: up 8 percent</li>

<li>Symbian (Nokia phones and some older Samsung phones not running Android): up 1 percent</li>

<li>Windows Mobile: up 21 percent</li>
</ul>

<p>Juniper reports a 155 percent increase in malware activity across all mobile operating systems. Despite these alarming figures, mobile devices still account for only a small percent of malware attacks. The vast bulk of malware continues to target desktop platforms.</p>

<p>
<strong>Types of Mobile Malware</strong></p>

<p>Malware sneaks onto mobile devices in several ways. Cybercriminals add malicious code to a legitimate app, repackage the app and distribute the program through third-party app stores. Online links and vulnerabilities within a phone's operating system also spread malware.</p>

<p>Malware comes in many forms, but most focus on information theft or premium-service abuse. Spyware harvests your location, browser history, international mobile equipment identity number (an anti-theft device) and application lists. Some malware harvests text messages. Add all this together, and the malware writer has enough information to commit identity fraud.</p>

<p>Another route into your bank account is via SMS (Short Message Service, meaning text) messaging. A Trojan is a type of malware that hides malicious code in a legitimate-looking application. In the case of SMS Trojans, this could mean signing you up for premium texting services that run in the background, out of sight, when youre using the phone. The first indication of an SMS Trojan often comes as palpitation-inducing charges on your phone bill.</p>

<p>Other malware will trick you into signing up for expensive monthly subscriptions to fake services, often without your knowledge, or uses your mobile device to send spam text ads to others.</p>

<p>
<strong>Looking Forward: What to Expect in 2012</strong></p>

<p>If malware activity in 2011 is any indication, we can expect more of the same in 2012. Inserting malicious code into legitimate banking and financial apps will become more common as people increasingly access their finances through mobile devices. Rates of SMS fraud, already a profitable area for cybercriminals, are also expected to increase.</p>

<p>Botnets are networks of malware-infected computers, used by hackers to spread spam or launch hacking attacks on other networks. Mobile botnets already exist, but are likely to become more common as hackers exploit mobile technology. Mobile botnets allow hackers to make phone calls and send messages over your phone, access user accounts and harvest personal information.</p>

<p>
<strong>Protecting Yourself Against Mobile Malware</strong></p>

<p>Prevention remains your best defense against mobile malware, which is notoriously difficult to purge from a mobile operating system. Avoid third-party app stores like GetJar and free apps. First-party application stores, such as Android Market or Apples app store, offer safer applications than third-party sources.</p>

<p>Use a trusted antivirus program on your mobile device, and keep it updated at all times. Back up information on your mobile just as you would (or should) with a desktop platform (

<p>DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks are a businesss worst nightmare. They can slow down, disable or even damage your Web site. Learn to deal with these attacks and keep you and your customers online.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<strong>What is a DDoS?</strong></p>

<p>What a nightmare! Without warning your Web site is swamped with requests for information or to simply view your homepage. These requests come so quickly, and in such great numbers, that your site cant keep up. It starts to run so slowly that no one, not even your customers, can get through. Your site might crash, and permanent damage is possible.</p>

<p>Youve been the victim of a DDoS: A distributed denial of service.</p>

<p>
<strong>How a DDoS Works</strong></p>

<p>A distributed-denial-of-service attack is carried out by hackers and it overloads your server, causing it to malfunction. These hackers set up networks of host computers  often without the hosts knowledge  to make demands on your Web site. These demands might be as simple as viewing Web pages, except that they come as quickly as 100 times per second.</p>

<p>The scary part is that the DDoS attack looks just like any normal requests. They often 
<em>are</em> normal requests, just at huge volumes. Thus, they are notoriously hard to predict or prevent. Because the hackers set up these networks of host computers, there is no centralized computer to deny access to. This is why even Microsoft has fallen victim to a DDoS.</p>

<p>So, what can you do?</p>

<p>
<strong>How to Recognize a DDoS</strong></p>

<p>The first step in avoiding damage from a DDoS is to realize youve been the victim of one. The best way to do this is to stay alert to changes in the way your network is acting. Has there been a slowdown in page-loading times? Are your computers going offline? Have your customers complained they cant get through to your site?</p>

<p>Keep a close eye on your network and, should it start to act funny, look into it. 
<em>Right away</em>. Preventing damage from a DDoS depends on acting quickly.</p>

<p>
<strong>Mitigating a DDoS</strong></p>

<p>If a DDoS attack can be characterized as a flood of requests to your server, then mitigating that attack means slowing the flood. Notice that the idea is to slow the flood, not stop it.</p>

<p>Why? The DDoS is mimicking requests that are necessary to the normal functioning of your network. You cant stop these requests from coming in altogether because that would keep everyone from using your Web site, including your customers.</p>

<p>The trick, rather, is to build a filter that separates bad requests from good. To do this, you must discover the nature of the attack. Find out what processes are running as part of the attack and turn them off. If a particular application is running many times on your system, particularly one you dont recognize, its a strong sign that youve been hit with a DDoS.</p>

<p>Next, trace the attacks origin. If you discover its source, you can prevent the DDoS. The problem is that the immediate source is a network of host computers, which may number in the hundreds. To trace backwards from the hosts to the hacker, youll likely need the help of your Internet Service Provider (ISP). You wont be able to follow the attack upstream on your own.</p>

<p>
<strong>Getting Help</strong></p>

<p>DDoS attacks are difficult to deal with, and you will need assistance from your ISP, possibly from a professional DDoS mitigation firm. Its a tricky, unpleasant task, but you can close the floodgates of a DDoS attack.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>Have you been pondering a move to Cloud City? Many small businesses have shifted to cloud computing for their data backup and recovery, but that doesnt mean the strategy is right for everyone.</p>

<p>Difficulties can abound, from hardware upgrades to staffing needs to more paperwork. But the advantages can be significant, too, with lowered storage costs and better security.</p>

<p>Here's what to know if youre considering a move to the cloud.</p>

<p>
<strong>Seeing the Benefits</strong></p>

<p>Cloud computing took its time getting from hype to reality, but now that its here, the strategy is taking hold for a reason. Cloud-based backup allows a company to share resources with other businesses and harness the power of that arrangement.</p>

<p>According to a recent 
<a href="http://webobjects.cdw.com/webobjects/media/pdf/Newsroom/CDW-Cloud-Tracking-Poll-Report-0511.pdf">CDW Cloud Computing Tracking poll</a>:</p>

<ul>

<li>84 percent of organizations are using at least one cloud application.</li>

<li>76 percent of small business cloud users report theyve reduced the cost of applications because of moving to the cloud.</li>
</ul>

<p>Part of the appeal is the clouds ability to deliver data anywhere, anytime. Having that type of backup and recovery capability can lead to higher productivity, better mobility and access to cutting-edge technology tools.</p>

<p>
<strong>Seeing the Challenges</strong></p>

<p>Although using cloud-based backup and recovery can deliver many advantages, you must also consider the risks. Security can still be an issue, and increasing encryption strategies may be burdensome to a smaller company.</p>

<p>Also, experts advise that in order to minimize security issues, business owners should stay away from public Wi-Fi when checking on their cloud-based data. For executives who depend on public wireless when traveling, implementing stronger security measures just to access a file may seem overwhelming.</p>

<p>Another consideration is budgeting. Although cloud-based backup and recovery might be beneficial in the long run, it comes with some upfront costs, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>Hardware upgrades</li>

<li>Network assessments</li>

<li>Consulting</li>

<li>Training</li>
</ul>

<p>If your IT infrastructure needs improvement, cloud computing could present a more cost-efficient option. However, you need to take a close look at your return on investment to make sure the benefits are worth the price.</p>

<p>
<strong>Seeing the Future</strong></p>

<p>While its impossible to predict technology trends with pinpoint accuracy, many analysts and industry experts believe cloud computing will continue to gain traction  especially with small businesses.</p>

<p>In the next decade, its likely that traditional, licensed applications will begin to recede into the background as shared computing becomes more popular.</p>

<p>When determining whether the cloud is right for your small business, youll need to weigh the risks and benefits. But one thing is certain: The cloud isnt drifting away anytime soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next big security risk could be as close as your hip holster  Is your mobile device protected?</p></blockquote>

<p>Are you carrying around a bulls-eye for hackers?</p>

<p>Small business IT security has generally focused on servers, laptops and desktops. But with the speedy rise of smartphone technology, the next big threat could be inside your hip holster.</p>

<p>
<strong>Boosting Awareness</strong></p>

<p>When using a PC, most people take security precautions, like being careful about what they download, changing passwords regularly and not giving</p>

<p>strangers administrative access. However, when it comes to smartphones, they could be skipping the same types of security strategies that keep them safe in the workplace.</p>

<p>Risks to mobile devices abound, especially since they can be stolen or lost so easily. According to a 
<a href="http://www.mcafee.com/us/about/news/2011/q2/20110523-01.aspx">report from security firm McAfee and Carnegie Mellon University</a>, risky behaviors that weaken security are commonplace these days.</p>

<p>Fewer than half of device users back up their mobile data more than once a week, the report finds. Even more alarming, about 50 percent of device users keep passwords, PIN codes and credit-card details right on their devices. One in three users keeps sensitive, work-related information on their devices, which could lead to data breaches.</p>

<p>Although 95 percent of companies have policies in place to increase mobile security, only about a third of employees actually follow them.</p>

<p>
<strong>State of Security</strong></p>

<p>As a result of lax security on the part of mobile users, the number of attacks has skyrocketed. Security incidents doubled between 2010 and 2011, and experts believe the problem is getting even worse. Thats cause for concern, since many companies have come to rely on mobile devices for staying in touch with customers and keeping employees connected.</p>

<p>Security issues can crop up with devices that havent been properly updated with the latest security patches. Also, hackers are increasingly using malicious apps, which promise games or business software to users, but can steal information from a mobile device once theyre downloaded.</p>

<p>Experts believe that hackers are gearing up to exploit mobile payment options as well, since they can gain access to banking information through those apps.</p>

<p>
<strong>A Strong Defense</strong></p>

<p>Defending against threats requires a working strategy (not just a mobile security policy) that raises awareness within the company and establishes strong protections. Taking these steps is a great start:</p>

<ul>

<li>Make sure employees don't download malicious apps from third-party app stores or unsecured app repositories, which tend to interfere with device operations very soon after download. (Two telltale signs of infection: The device slows down, or can't synchronize with other devices.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Double-check that employees apply the latest software patches or, better yet, ensure that their devices are set for automatic software updates. These options are available in your phones Settings menu.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Seek out and evaluate applications from the growing mobile security- software field. Most options youll find are quite affordable.</li>
</ul>

<p>The state of security in the mobile realm can be alarming, but you dont have to put your company at risk. Get rid of the bulls-eye, and hackers will find another target instead.</p>

<p>Ready to start cloudhopping? As with other types of technology services, cloud providers vary in what they offer. But some features are must-haves for any business.</p>

<p>When evaluating providers for backup service, look for these essential traits:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Strong reporting and performance measures.</strong> Transparency is key when making sure you can get a strong return on investment with cloud backup services. Providers deliver different application performance results depending on their architecture and geographical location. They should be able to articulate how theyve served other companies of your size and with your needs, and what level of business continuity they provide.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Reality checks.</strong> Not all companies are ready to switch to cloud computing. Some may find the strategy would actually decrease productivity and increase management issues. A good provider will help you determine whether cloud-computing storage fits your organization. Often, theyll do this through a pilot project with your enterprise applications, which will target operations management, networking and security.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Preparation assistance.</strong> Several steps must be taken to switch to cloud computing for backup. These may include hardware upgrades, implementation of new management tools, better encryption solutions and training. Reputable cloud providers have numerous resources for preparation, such as consulting services and webinars.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Support.</strong> Cloud-computing providers have gotten better at support in recent years, and now expectations are high for 24/7 assistance. Some providers vary their support based on different packages, but a reputable company will provide basic support without high fees.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Security assurance.</strong> Your data is your business. A good cloud provider understands that and knows how to offer protection. It should have its security safeguards in place while helping you create better encryption measures. Another aspect to security is compliance, so be sure a provider understands the data regulations that affect your industry generally, and your business specifically.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Service-level agreements (SLAs).</strong> Cloud providers each have a certain level of service delivery; some may offer 99.5 percent computing availability, while others may offer 99.9 percent. If you have mission-critical operations, the higher level of availability will be vital. A reputable provider will give you a strong SLA, detailing what type of service credits youll receive in the event (however unlikely) of a service outage.</li>
</ul>

<p>By knowing these basics, youll find it easier to compare providers and choose the one thats right for your business. Then you can spend more time enjoying the cloud and its benefits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before you fly into cloud computing, make sure you know what to expect.</p></blockquote>

<p>Looks like your kindergarten teacher was right: Learning to share is important.</p>

<p>Cloud computing allows you to share applications and resources, controlling costs and boosting business power. It can be an amazing strategy for companies that dont have the personnel or hardware to run every aspect of IT on their own.</p>

<p>Before you go flying into the stratosphere, however, you should know a few things about the cloud.</p>

<p>
<strong>Myth:</strong> Clouds are always located offsite.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Truth:</strong> There are two different types of cloud computing: public and private. Smaller businesses usually benefit from a public cloud, which brings the company together with others to share resources. But some choose a private cloud implementation, which gives them cloud-type capabilities, with the added advantage of having all those resources in-house.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Myth: </strong>Clouds are always cheaper.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Truth: </strong>Particularly in the case of private clouds, this isnt true. With certain implementations, cloud computing can cost more than maintaining all applications and services within a standard corporate data center. Its important to look at all costs and determine the time frames for return on investment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Myth: </strong>All companies are ready for cloud computing.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Truth: </strong>Although the cloud can free up internal IT resources, and potentially reduce the need for more hardware purchasing, that doesnt mean its a one-size-fits-all strategy. Some companies may find that switching to cloud services would require significant upgrades on everything from software to firewalls to servers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Myth: </strong>Clouds eliminate the need for in-house IT.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Truth: </strong>Cloud services may allow you to cut back on IT staff, but youll still need technology personnel. Someone has to communicate regularly with the cloud provider and handle various issues. Having a little tech savvy also comes into play when choosing a cloud-services firm, getting the company ready for the switch and making the changeover. Also, if building a private cloud, you may need to augment your IT department, particularly for initial implementation. However, for those businesses who do not desire on-site IT personnel, or shops that are too small to justify additions to the payroll for this one task, a consultant model that has a certified professional working part-time or for reduced hours often makes sense.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Initial Launch</strong></p>

<p>When looking into a cloud-computing move, consider the numbers that are relevant to your business. Shop around for providers and ask questions about costs, privacy controls, data recovery, IT support and other services.</p>

<p>Remember that a cloud-computing firm should be an extension of your business, not a hard-to-reach data center that doesnt allow you 24/7 access to your data.</p>

<p>If youre armed with the facts and ready to embark on a cloud strategy, then congratulate yourself: Your kindergarten teacher would be proud.</p>

<title>Cloud Computing Guide and Glossary</title>
<description>Confused by the cloud? Here are some of the most important terms to understand before embarking on your journey into the cloud.</description>

<p>Cloud computing, like other types of technologies and business strategies, comes with a distinct set of terms. From cloudstorming to cloudsourcing, the language can get complicated, but dont let that keep you from venturing into the cloud.</p>

<p>Here are some quick definitions to get you in the know, fast:</p>

<p>
<strong>Cloud computing:</strong> First, theres this umbrella term itself. It refers not to a product or technology (although its often called 
<em>the</em> cloud), but to how computing is delivered. That is, you share resources, infrastructure and applications with others. Think of it as a digital version of a rented storage facility  everyone shares the same building, land and utilities, but your stuff is separated and kept safe from intruders. (For more information about getting started with cloud computing, check out our primer on the cloud, 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/explore-tips-and-advice/easytech-u/cloud-services-crash-course-2/">Cloud Services Crash Course</a>.)</p>

<p>
<strong>Cloudsourcing: </strong>Refers to cloud services replacing traditional IT services. For example, in a traditional IT environment, a company would have a room with servers and other hardware, and use applications purchased just for the company. Cloud services replace that hardware and software with shared services. While cloud computing doesnt eliminate the need for tech professionals within a company, it can reduce IT costs through cloudsourcing.</p>

<p>
<strong>Cloudstorming: </strong>Sounds meteorological, but cloudstorming just means that multiple cloud-computing environments are connected. This creates an environment with increased storage capacity, faster processing speeds and better application availability.</p>

<p>
<strong>Consumption-based:</strong> Cloud-computing services can differ in terms of pricing models. A firm that charges based on time usage will offer a subscription-based price. However, most cloud providers rely on consumption-based pricing. This means you pay according to how much of the service you use. For example, you might pay based on how many applications you access or how much data is stored. The general term for both types of pricing models is pay as you go.</p>

<p>
<strong>On-demand service: </strong>Particularly if you have a smaller business, you can make cloud computing more affordable by purchasing it only when needed. For instance, an online retailer of holiday goods might benefit from buying cloud services in November and December to accommodate increased site traffic. The expanded server capacity ensures that the site wont go down during heavier traffic periods.</p>

<p>
<strong>Private cloud: </strong>Many smaller businesses rely on a public cloud, which brings together multiple companies who pay based on usage. Other companies prefer a private cloud, which has the benefits of the cloud model, but is managed internally by the companys IT staff.</p>

<p>
<strong>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):</strong> When applied to the cloud, this term means applications are delivered via the cloud rather than running on a companys internal servers. For example, an expensive customer relationship management (CRM) application might be out of reach for a smaller company that wanted to implement it in-house. But using the cloud gives the business access to the app without the usual per-desk licensing fees. SaaS enterprise software encompasses a wide range of applications, including accounting, HR, content management and help-desk management.</p>

<p>
<strong>Service-level agreement (SLA): </strong>This agreement is crucial for creating an understanding between you and your cloud provider about what will be included in your cloud-computing arrangement. Every SLA should define the level of service provided, responsibility for technical fixes and support availability. In the SLA, cloud firms should give guarantees about performance, security and access.</p>

<p>Knowing these basic terms will help you figure out what type of cloud service is right for your company, and what agreements should be in place before you get started. Now you can sound like a pro as you go cloud jumping.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Though your PC's inner workings may seem mystifying, breaking down the various components is a worthwhile exercise  especially if you're thinking about upgrades.</p></blockquote>

<p>The PC is really a group of interconnected parts working together, including the following components.</p>

<p>
<strong>Motherboard:</strong> At the heart of your PC is the motherboard  the communications center that allows the various components to talk to one another. The motherboard not only determines your PC's capabilities, but also defines your upgrade options because other parts rely on its support and compatibility.</p>

<p>
<strong>Chipset:</strong> Tying the CPU to the motherboard is the chipset, which carries messages between the CPU and other components, including your PC's main memory. When thinking about upgrades, remember that your chipset has to be optimized to support a new CPU.</p>

<p>
<strong>Central processing unit (CPU):</strong> Think of the CPU as the brain of the PC. It manages the calculations constantly taking place within your computer. Installing this sensitive piece of hardware takes steady, experienced hands, as even the smallest error can have disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>
<strong>Random access memory (RAM):</strong> RAM is where your PC manages data for the CPU. When RAM runs short, your computer relies more heavily on the hard drive, slowing down productivity. A RAM upgrade is a simple, cost-effective way to get a big boost. But remember: The maximum RAM your PC can support is determined by the motherboard.</p>

<p>
<strong>Video card:</strong> The video card handles the graphics piece of your PC's thought processes, complementing the work of the CPU. Games and design programs rely on the video card, but upgrading to a card that handles higher resolutions can also allow you to add a better or second monitor.</p>

<p>
<strong>Hard drive:</strong> The hard drive serves as a mass storage system, letting you hold on to permanent data, files and programs. Upgrading your hard drive  or adding a second  can help with storing big files and digital images as well as managing backups.</p>

<p>
<strong>Display: </strong>Your PC's monitor interprets documents and images and lays them out in front of you, allowing you to interact with the computer. Monitor upgrades (e.g., larger screens, higher resolution, dual displays) are a popular route for optimizing the work environment and boosting productivity.</p>

<p>Your PC's components rely on each other to do their best work. A well-done upgrade not only strengthens this sense of interconnectedness, but also generates an across-the-board power boost.</p>

<p>Try these tips to bring your old PC back to life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Laptops do more than slow down when they're running useless tasks; they also heat up! Excess heat can damage your drive and shorten your laptop's battery significantly.</p>

<p>If your hard drive is filled up, moving some data to an external drive may provide a quantum leap in speed.</p>

<p>Some of the sneakiest malware is installed via phishing, a type of scam in which hackers pretend to be a credit or financial institution in order to get your data. Always double-check that you're on the right site.</p>

<p>Spring cleaning can also mean, well, actual cleaning. Wipe the collected dust from your PC's vents and fans for a more efficient, cooler-running machine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's the great scourge of modern computing: The Slowdown.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your beloved PC  once a high-flying speed machine  has gradually lost its charm. Tasks that used to take milliseconds now take minutes; just clicking through your file folders can feel like a chore.</p>

<p>Let's face it: The magic is gone. Can you possibly save this relationship?</p>

<p>Yes, you can. The most common reasons for declining PC performance are generally fixable. And, with just a few well-timed surgical strikes, you could find yourself falling in love all over again with the dashing adrenaline junkie you remember from the store.</p>

<h2>When Apps Attack</h2>

<p>The primary culprit in most slowdowns is unused applications, or programs running in the background. As we download software over time, many of these installations throw in little utilities, widgets and other programs that hog the computer's resources and slow everything to a crawl.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tip: </strong>Try hitting 
<strong>Ctrl-Alt-Delete</strong> for a quick review of what's running, and close anything that looks clearly unnecessary. For a more permanent solution, head over to the 
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, choose 
<strong>Add or Remove Programs</strong> and uninstall any unused software for good.</p>

<h2>
<strong>Browser Bottlenecks</strong></h2>

<p>Has surfing the Web become more tedious than watching a full day of Olympic curling? The problem could be extensions. Most modern Web browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Safari) allow users to add special functionality on an 
<em>à la carte</em> basis by installing small add-ons, or extensions.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tip: </strong>Try disabling or removing these one by one, restarting the browser each time. If your speed picks up, you've found the problem.</p>

<h2>
<strong>Enemies Within</strong></h2>

<p>A harder issue to isolate is the dreaded computer virus, a form of malware. Many computer viruses perform repetitive activities without your knowledge, such as making copies of themselves or sending your personal information to bad guys. This kind of constant activity can quickly jam the wheels of your PC and kill its productivity.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Download and install a good antivirus program, then run a comprehensive scan. You may be amazed to discover how many malicious bugs are gumming up the works.</p>

<h2>Defrag Time</h2>

<p>One last way to speed the plow is to use your PC's natural self-cleaning mechanism: the defragmentation program, or defrag.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tip: </strong>Typically available under 
<strong>All Programs &amp;gt; Accessories &amp;gt; System Tools</strong>, the 
<strong>Disk Defragmenter</strong> moves everything around and consolidates all the data on your drive, making your documents easier to find, retrieve, load and run. Little changes like this can add up to a significant speed savings on older PCs.</p>

<h2>As Good as New</h2>

<p>The secret truth about the dreaded slowdown is that it isn't a fatal condition. Your computer's chip is still running at the exact same speed it always was. What has changed is the number of things being thrown at it on a daily basis. With a bit of maintenance and some seasonal TLC, you can cut down on those distractions significantly  leaving you free to focus on rekindling that relationship and making every new day feel just like your very first "data."</p>

<p>Call it The Speedup.</p>

<p>Looking to speed up your PC? You might try over clocking or adjusting your visual effects settings.</p></blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<h2>Are you hot for overclocking?</h2>

<p>Overclocking involves adjusting computer components so they operate at a higher clock rate for better performance. But a big threat to overclocked components is heat; the increase in speed can damage hardware if proper cooling mechanisms aren't in place. Since overclocking often voids your warranties, don't mess around with it unless you've got the process down cold.</p>

<h2>What price beauty?</h2>

<p>A simple way to speed up your PC is turning off unnecessary visual effects like fading icons, animations and dropdown shadows. Go to Visual Effects in your Control Panel and adjust for best performance. You can always switch back to the fancy visuals, but we bet you won't even miss them when they're gone.</p>

<p>Take a look around your office. In a given day, how much time does your team waste waiting for slow computers to boot up or load programs?</p>

<p>Updating your PCs isnt about buying new toys; its about making your systems more efficient and making it easier to get your work done. From hardware upgrades, like adding RAM or new graphics cards, to software updates, such as service packs or new programs, you can optimize your machines in a number of ways.</p>

<p>But are upgrades like these worth it? And if so, how do they boost day-to-day office productivity in the real world?</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Time: </strong>The minutes that a faster machine saves  at start-up, at shutdown and in managing programs in between  may seem like small gains. Over time, however, these minutes can add up quickly. Imagine recapturing just 10 minutes a day, Monday through Friday, doing actual work instead of waiting out that irritating little hourglass on your screen. At nearly an hour each week, this translates to a full week of added work time a year  per employee.</li>

<li>
<strong>Speed: </strong>Even a basic upgrade can have a real, immediate impact on your ability to cruise through the task at hand. Swapping out your graphics card, for example, allows you to add a second monitor to your desktop  and increase your productivity by as much as 20 to 30 percent.
<a title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></li>

<li>
<strong>Multitasking: </strong>Optimized computers allow you to multitask, which is essential to getting stuff done. If you're running several programs at once throughout your day (and who isn't?), "overclocking" or adding RAM will let you switch seamlessly between programs without draining your hard drive.</li>

<li>
<strong>Reliability:</strong> Better protection against system failures, crashes and viruses not only makes for fewer interruptions (and less frustrated employees), but also for less time spent on IT assistance. Whether you're tapping dedicated IT staff or wasting your own time on the horn getting advice, a sound machine means far fewer interruptions. That's especially good news if youre tech support, too.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>No need to panic when you suspect your computer has a virus.  Here are some simple steps.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most malware is already familiar to the folks who write antivirus software. If you think you may have just let a virus onto your computer, unplug the network connection and run a scan.</p>

<p>When all else fails, go to 
<strong>Control Panel &amp;gt;</strong> 
<strong>System and Security</strong>, and select Restore your computer to an earlier time under the 
<strong>Action Center</strong>. This simple step removes any software you have installed in the last several days (but also restores your files to their previous state).</p>

<p>Restarting your computer in Safe Mode may pause the problem, as this mode disables many features that viruses like to use. Hold down the F8 key while the computer is restarting, then run a full system scan while in this state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your computer is stronger than you think.  Learn about some of the most common viruses and the best ways to stop them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, the rumors are true: The Internet is a wild, woolly place filled with evil forces that want to bring down your PC.</p>

<p>Thankfully, computer security has grown stronger over time, and today your system and Web browsers have fewer security holes than ever. As for the not-so-distant past well, that was another story.</p>

<p>Below, we look at some of the most wanted computer viruses of the Internet Age because those who fail to scan, delete and reboot the past are doomed to repeat it.</p>

<h2>Melissa, the Matriarch</h2>

<p>Way back in the misty dawn of 1999, the first computer virus to capture the worlds attention arrived with a disarmingly innocuous name: Melissa. Dubbed in honor of an exotic dancer, the virus quickly spread itself through email attachments, thus laying the groundwork for a jillion copycats to follow.</p>

<p>Melissa took advantage of a security flaw in Microsoft Outlook to contact the first 50 address book entries of the infected party, enticing each with a vague invitation to open an attached document. It took an update to Outlook and some expensive public education to kill off Melissa for good.</p>

<h2>Love in Disguise</h2>

<p>The I Love You virus arrived in 2001 with a pointed mission: to destroy system files and steal passwords. This worm sent itself through email channels with a brief message of love from a secret admirer. Once downloaded, it wrought considerable damage throughout the Internet. Total price tag: $10 billion. Further security updates to email servers and some PC software were needed to break the back of I Love You, despite its many amorous protests to the contrary.</p>

<h2>The Conficker Plague</h2>

<p>Conficker arrived on the back of another menace known as the Sasser worm. Like its predecessor, Conficker exploited a type of software (known as a Windows remote service) to spread itself without user aid. And like I Love You, Conficker was a conduit for further hacks: upon installing itself, it began stealing passwords and installing malicious software (
<em>malware</em>), such as  keyloggers (software that tracks every keystroke you make) and back doors (commands that allow hackers to take control of your PC remotely).</p>

<p>Conficker is still around, and can still turn infected PCs into drones ready to do the bidding of a far-flung master. The best prevention: keeping your antivirus software up to date.</p>

<p>The world of computer malware is never without emerging new stars worthy of our boos and hisses. Recent entrants like MyDoom and the Storm worm are still considered armed and dangerous, so stay cautious, scrutinize all emails and click only when confident.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From lists to shortcuts, here are a few of our tricks to help you become a Windows 7 master.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Windows 7 operating system (OS) answered the prayers of those who love streamlined systems for efficient output. (And who wouldnt love that, after all?)</p>

<p>Many tech-savvy users have already begun taking advantage of all Windows 7 has to offer
<strong>.</strong> If this doesnt sound like you, here are some ways to become a true Windows 7 master.</p>

<h2>Optimize Your Jump Lists</h2>

<p>Jump Lists are Windows 7s way of giving you instant access to recently opened files and programs. Youll find Jump Lists in the taskbar, on the Start menu and by right-clicking program icons.</p>

<ul>

<li>Pin favorite files and programs to Jump Lists so you can access and manage them with a click or keyboard shortcut. To pin a program, go to 
<strong>Start</strong>, right-click the program icon and then click 
<strong>Pin to Start</strong> 
<strong>Menu</strong> or 
<strong>Pin to Taskbar</strong>.</li>

<li>Interact with applications in your taskbar with the 
<strong>Win</strong> key plus numbers 19. For example, 
<strong>Win+3</strong> will launch whichever program appears in the third position of the taskbar.</li>

<li>Do you love Jump Lists? Expand the number of items displayed on yours by clicking 
<strong>Start</strong>, 
<strong>Properties </strong>and then
<strong> Customize</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Find the Shortest Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Have you learned every keyboard shortcut  and created some of your own? Windows 7 shortcuts are especially useful when youre working with a number of programs or documents at once.</p>

<ul>

<li>Use the 
<strong>Win+Arrow </strong>buttons to move a
<strong> </strong>window around your screen, and 
<strong>Win+M</strong> to minimize.</li>

<li>Navigate folders with 
<strong>Alt+Arrow</strong>.
<strong></strong></li>

<li>Access your Jump List with 
<strong>Alt+Win+#</strong>. 
<strong></strong></li>

<li>Once you have the hang of these, use the 
<strong>Shortcuts</strong> tab in 
<strong>Program Properties</strong> to create your own keyboard shortcuts for the programs you use most.</li>
</ul>

<h2>See More Clearly</h2>

<p>Windows 7 not only lets you build a hyper personalized, streamlined desktop, but also improves your visual experience with clear text and true colors. These tweaks make the biggest impact on flat-screen monitors.</p>

<ul>

<li>Sharpen text using the 
<strong>ClearType Text Tuner</strong>.
<strong> </strong>Locate 
<strong>ClearType </strong>in the 
<strong>Control Panel</strong>,
<strong> </strong>and the tuner will walk you through a few quick steps to find the display option that suits you best.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>If youre a designer or you work with colors, use 
<strong>Calibrate Color</strong> in the 
<strong>Control Panel</strong> under 
<strong>Display</strong> to adjust brightness, contrast, balance and more on your screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>If youre already a Windows 7 master, congratulations! But if youre not quite there yet, just imagine the boost in productivity  and fun  youll have once you optimize your personal Windows 7 experience.</p>

<p>How fast is your internet connection? Learn how to measure your connection speed with these simple, free tools.</p></blockquote>

<p>PC users, start your engines.</p>

<p>Hundreds of online speed tests allow you to gauge everything from PC performance to Internet speeds, right from your browser. This kind of information can be valuable for determining whether it's time for a hardware or software speed upgrade, or whether your Internet connection needs attention.</p>

<p>Here's a trio of top tests to check out.</p>

<h2>
<a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">Speedtest.net</a>
<strong></strong></h2>

<p>This speed test is provided by Ookla, a firm that also delivers stats on an array of network metrics like packet loss, jitter and latency  three aspects of connectivity that affect Internet performance.</p>

<p>For the free speed test, the site measures upload and download rates through broadband testing and analysis. So, you'll get a glimpse of how fast your PC performs when it copies data from one system to another or transfers data to another system. You can then compare your stats to national averages and get a letter grade (e.g., B+) to determine how your speed stacks up.</p>

<h2>
<a href="http://www.bandwidthplace.com/">Bandwidth Place</a>
<strong></strong></h2>

<p>A simple speed test that gives you a look at your current rates, Bandwidth Place offers fast and free service. The site also interprets the numbers. For example, a "solid" connection speed would be between 5.5 Mbps and 10.5 Mbps for both uploads and downloads.</p>

<p>Bandwidth Place is an online shopping site for bandwidth-related products like DSL and satellite Internet, so it does have a "sales pitch" element. But you're not required to buy anything, and the company isn't pushy about selling its offerings (no pop-ups or flashy animation).</p>

<h2>
<a href="http://www.auditmypc.com/broadband-speed-test.asp">AuditMyPC</a></h2>

<p>This barebones site measures download and upload speeds quickly and for free. The software developer running AuditMyPC, "Jim," also offers a broadband speed test to Web site owners so they can put the tool on their own sites.</p>

<p>The site was developed to promote security awareness, and the developer has created tools that test PCs for vulnerabilities. These tools include firewall tests and a Web site monitoring service that detects unauthorized content changes to a site.</p>

<p>Like many freeware developers, Jim doesn't get paid for his work, so he elicits contributions from those who find his tools useful. The donation page of AuditMyPC lets you buy Jim a chai, deluxe hot dog or gift card.</p>

<h2>Speed Tests and Safety</h2>

<p>Speed tests are useful for verifying that your Internet service provider is delivering the appropriate connection speed. But remember: Speed tests should be browser-based, so nothing should download to your computer. If a site only has downloads as an option, find another site to prevent the risk of viruses.</p>

<p>Also, be careful with sites that require you to disable your security program to run the scan. But if everything looks legit (e.g., it's a well-known company), then feel free to get on one of these online racetracks and test your speed.</p>

<p align="left">Technology can age and break down more quickly than a reality-TV story line, but its much easier to patch and fix your PC than a reality stars marriage. If your browser is sluggish or your PC is slowing down, try some of these free tools to bring it back to speed before you invest in more RAM, a new browser or a new computer.</p>

<h2 align="left">Free Tools For Your PC</h2>

<p align="left">
<a href="http://www.pcdecrapifier.com/home">
<strong>PC Decrapifier</strong></a>: When you purchase a PC, it usually comes loaded with free and trial software that uses system resources and slows down your computer even though you arent using or planning to use the software. After you answer a few questions, PC Decrapifier automatically removes programs, start-up items and icons that you dont need. It then creates a list of other things you might want to remove and prompts you for action.</p>

<p align="left">
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/AppBooster/3000-18512_4-75014260.html">
<strong>AppBooster</strong></a>
<strong>:</strong> There are background processes that operate even when you arent using their applications, and this makes your PC sluggish. AppBooster automatically disables unnecessary services and processes without restarting your computer, so only the games and applications you are running have optimum access to your system.</p>

<h2 align="left">Free Extensions For Google Chrome and Firefox</h2>

<p align="left">
<a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/">
<strong>AdBlock Plus</strong></a>
<strong>:</strong> Are you tired of having your Web browsing interrupted and slowed down by unwanted ads? Not just pop-up ads, but any ads that distract you from the content you want to see? This extension will make your Web experience faster by blocking ads from loading and safer by blocking malware domains. You can customize it to only block ads on particular pages you visit.</p>

For instance, right-clicking offers detailed information for each download, such as how much data is being transferred and its rate, percent completed and the time left for the download to end.</p>

<p align="left">
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">
<strong>Grease Monkey</strong></a>
<strong>:</strong> This program allows you to run or write custom scripts that enhance your browsing experience. For example, a script might remove the ads and extra space in your Webmail inbox. Ready-made, free scripts for many popular sites are available for Grease Monkey to run at

<blockquote>
<p>It's easy to get comfortable with your current version of Windows. It's not as easy to know when the right time is to make the leap to Windows 7. This article should help.</p></blockquote>

<p>Its easy to get comfortable with an operating system (OS). We understand. After all, you know what to expect when that trusty ol OS starts up. Maybe you've even grown used to its sluggish pace and spotty performance. Perhaps you treat that aging operating system like an old car that has its quirks but still manages to get you from point A to point B.</p>

<p>That said, do you 
<em>really</em> want a clunker handling your important day-to-day office tasks and operations?</p>

<p>We ask the question because many people are still using Windows XP, an outdated system thats quickly becoming incompatible with the latest applications and services. Some Windows XP users might be resisting change because they dont understand how easy it can be to upgrade to Windows 7, but thats OK. As weve said already, sometimes the clunker is all you need.</p>

<p>However, if you 
<em>are</em> curious about an upgrade, here are a few good reasons for ditching that older OS for something shiny and new:</p>

<ul>

<li>In the technology world, where development is so rapid, Windows XP is treated like a relic. It was first released in 2001 and has been updated five times since. However, Microsoft will not upgrade the OS anymore, due to their focus on Windows 7, which means newer applications, hardware and gadgets might not work with it going forward.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Microsoft releases service packs for its major OS of the moment, Windows 7, and those free updates are crucial for compatibility, security and performance. The last service pack for Windows XP was released in 2008. With Microsoft now focused on Windows 7, no more XP updates are planned. Security and software compatibility could therefore become legitimate concerns for your shop.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>We dont mean to pile on the XP criticisms, but without service pack updates, the OS is subject to a host of security issues. These regular updates are crucial for providing protection for a system because they contain countermeasures against the newest threats. Since no service pack has been issued for Windows XP in three years, you could be at greater risk for becoming a hackers target.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Oh, the waiting! Many Windows XP users report overall sluggish performance. Activities like booting up take much longer than they should, while basic tasks like opening files, visiting Web pages, saving documents and downloading music often involve additional slowdowns. Switching from Windows XP to Windows 7 isnt like swapping an old car for a new one; its more like moving from a horse and buggy to a hovercraft.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Love that new gadget you got for the holiday? Cross your fingers that itll work with Windows XP, or else youll have an expensive paperweight. When developers work on new devices, they focus on compatibility with the systems that will be used most in the years ahead. For PC owners, that means Windows 7. Although your older external drives, printers, cameras and other gadgets might work with Windows XP right now, trying to get connectivity with current technology could be a hassle.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Speaking of gadget compatibility, the same issue crops up with applications and games. Even if youre happy with older versions of software, challenges can come up when someone emails you a document that was created in a newer version of the same application (e.g., Microsoft Word docs).</li>
</ul>

<p>Just because an ancient car can sputter to life doesnt mean its dependable for a long road trip. Similarly, you should think about whether its time to upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7. If your home or office places a premium on security, reliability and power (and who doesnt, really), the decision is pretty much a no-brainer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best way to ensure your system will handle the latest operating system without any issues from your previous installation is to perform a clean install.  Make sure you follow these steps so you're not left without your important files and media.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upgrading an operating system may seem daunting, but its easier than it sounds. With some upfront preparation, installation can be straightforward and, most importantly, pretty painless.</p>

<p>Here are some tips on how to prepare for a fresh install:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip #1: </strong>If the installation involves a switch from Windows XP to Windows 7, theres a handy way to find out if your PC is ready for an upgraded operating system. Download and run Microsofts 
<strong>Windows 7 </strong>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20">
<strong>Upgrade Advisor</strong></a>. The program will scan hardware, devices and applications to look for compatibility issues. If any issues are found, the tool provides guidance on how to resolve them. If the PC is already running Vista with acceptable performance, its likely ready for the upgrade (no need to even check with Advisor).</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip #2: </strong>Before running Upgrade Advisor, plug in and turn on any devices that you use regularly (e.g., USB drives, printers, external hard disks, scanners). This allows the tool to check if theyre Windows 7 compatible.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip #3: </strong>Once the computer is deemed ready for a fresh operating system install, go through all data, applications, games, videos, photos and other stored items to determine what should be kept or deleted. These checks may seem like a chore, but we promise its worth the time because it speeds up the backup process. Dont get too overzealous cleaning out your PC; only delete files and applications that are familiar to you. Being conservative will help you prevent accidental deletion of important Microsoft tools or programs that are necessary for running an operating system.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip #4: </strong>After cleanup, back up important programs as well as documents, photos and music. This can be done by using an external drive or an online backup service. Be sure to set aside some time for this step, since transferring all files can take hours or even days, depending on how much data is involved.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip #5: </strong>Back up settings and fonts by using the 
<strong>Files and Settings Transfer Wizard</strong>, which is located in the 
<strong>System Tools </strong>folder under 
<strong>Accessories</strong> in the 
<strong>Start</strong> menu. This isnt absolutely necessary, but it saves you from having to do reconfiguration after the installation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip #6: </strong>If youre moving from Vista, the process will involve choosing either 
<strong>Custom</strong> or 
<strong>Upgrade</strong> as an option. Going with Custom gives you more options, but it can also mean reinstalling applications. If you want to keep it simple, pick Upgrade.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip #7: </strong>Unplug all USB devices, printers, external drives and scanners, even if you connected them for the Advisor program. Weve seen reports of stalled installations caused by device connections.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip #8: </strong>Make sure youre connected to the Internet, since the installation process involves retrieving updates from Microsoft. If theres no Internet connection, the operating system can still be installed with updates downloaded later. However, its easier to do the entire fresh install while connected.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip #9: </strong>Have all important service numbers, Web sites or emails on hand for additional help. Think of it as your computer version of 911; you don't want to have to use it, but you have the number anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have you completed each of these steps? Great! Youre good to go. With a PC thats cleaned up and backed up, installation will be faster and easier. Now youll have time to think about all the ways to use that new, speedy processing power.</p>

<title>When Is It the Right Time for an Operating System Upgrade?</title>
<description>The most important part of your PC is the operating system (OS).  With constant development and improvement of software and the internet, an outdated OS can hold back your PC from reaching its true potential.</description>

<p>The most important part of your PC is the operating system (OS).  With the constant development and improvement of software and the internet, an outdated OS can hold back your PC from reaching its true potential.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ever get the feeling your PC is trying to tell you something? Maybe its not as responsive as it used to be, or it refuses to play nice with a new application. In those cases, what your PC wants to say is, Upgrade my operating system, please.</p>

<p>Performing an operating system upgrade refreshes a PC with better speed, security and reliability. If youre not sure whether it's the right time for an upgrade, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<h2>Do you keep reading materials next to the computer so youll have something to do as the system boots up?</h2>

<p>While were enthusiastic readers ourselves, the process of booting up shouldnt give you enough time to knock off a novel.</p>

<h2>When youre opening documents or applications, do you feel like time itself has slowed to a crawl, and yet youre still going normal speed?</h2>

<p>Sluggish system performance can make it seem like a PC is tired and lackluster, and that can be frustrating to a user who just wants to get things done.</p>

<h2>Are you the only person on your block still using Windows XP?</h2>

<p>Maybe youre hoping that XP will come back into style. But unlike fashion and bad jokes, operating systems dont cycle back around.</p>

<h2>When shopping for new applications or games, do you feel left out because the requirements list Windows 7 only?</h2>

<p>No doubt about it:
<em> </em>Having
<em> </em>an operating system thats too old can be a real buzzkill. Sorry to break this to you, but if you don't upgrade, it's only going to get worse. As your operating system ages, fewer applications and games will work with Windows XP.</p>

<h2>Are you careful to open only one application at a time, because more than that will cause additional slowdown?</h2>

<p>Its a tough choice: Do you spend your time waiting for one application to slowly start up or close? Or do you risk having several open at a time and brace for the computer to hang or freeze at some point? Neither option is very good, and your productivity suffers.</p>

<h2>Do you have to use elaborate workarounds just to plug your external devices into the PC?</h2>

<p>Yes, there are ways to make Windows XP recognize newer gadgets, but sometimes it takes cutting-edge IT skills to make that happen. But hey, if you happened to build a computer back in high school science, maybe youll enjoy the time spent navigating Web sites to look for complicated workarounds.</p>

<h2>Have you ever shouted at or pleaded with your PC?</h2>

<p>Most of us have done this at some point. But when a system operates the way it should, much less yelling is involved. We promise.</p>

<p>If you answered yes to one or more of these questions, then grant your PC what it desires most: a fresh operating system upgrade. You can count on faster performance, better security and greater compatibility  and theres no question about the value of those.</p>

<title>Face-Off: Our Tech Experts Discuss Your Sluggish PC</title>

<p>A sluggish computer can drag down productivity, but it's not always easy to diagnose the cause.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your PC is so pokey that you could run an errand in the time it takes to load an application. Is it riddled with infection, or simply crying out for a hardware upgrade and software cleanup?</p>

<p>We asked two Staples technology experts, Shawn Dube and Ryan Salinger, for their views on the likely causes of sluggish performance.</p>

<p>
<strong>Shawn: </strong>First of all, theres going to be some kind of indicator that youre infected. For instance, when you start up your computer, therell usually be a pop-up window saying hundreds of viruses are detected  a pretty common trick these days. Or, when you open your Web browser, you'll get redirected to another site. These types of incidents will be very persistent and easy to detect. With a computer thats running slowly, I wouldn't automatically say it's a virus. But if a virus is present, it can slow things down.</p>

<p>
<strong>Ryan: </strong>I think its a myth that its always viruses slowing down a PC; thats just something antivirus commercials claim to get you to buy their products. When your computer has a virus, what happens is that you get locked out, and your computer does funny things. You cant open programs, for example. Most likely, the PC is slow because its old. If you have a PC thats seven or eight years old, of course its not going to run as well as it did when you first got it. Its the same as your car  it needs regular maintenance and cleaning to keep it running well. But with a PC, people just think virus if the performance slows.</p>

<p>
<strong>Shawn: </strong>Age of the computer is one issue, but equally important is whats on the PC. You could have a lot of applications taking up resources, and that kind of thing builds up over time. It could be a failing piece of hardware, or maybe you just need some maintenance. Clearing out excess data and clearing cache folders are important for making sure your PC is running as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>
<strong>Ryan: </strong>If youve done all the cleanup, then it could be you're hitting a hardware limitation, like not enough RAM (random access memory). One thing we offer at EasyTech is a PC Tune-Up +, where we check for viruses and clean out temporary files. We also get an idea of how your PC is doing in terms of memory and processing power. Very often, we find out that whats needed is a memory upgrade. That's nice, because its the cheapest and most effective way to upgrade.</p>

<p>As the experts note, the cause of a sluggish PC most likely involves hardware and cleanup issues, not viruses. Unless your computer is showing those obvious signs of a virus, first investigate whether you need to upgrade hardware, transfer data to external hard drives or simply opt for a newer PC. The pros at EasyTech can give plenty of insight through their fast, affordable, tune-up service.</p>

<title>RAM-ology: An Introduction to PC Memory Upgrades</title>
<description>Everybody always seems to be talking about much RAM a computer has or needs. But, what is it? And how much does your machine really need?</description>

<p align="left">Everybody always seems to be talking about much RAM a computer has or needs. But, what is it? And how much does your machine really need? This article will give you the full story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">One of the most cost-effective performance boosts you can give your PC is to add more random-access memory (RAM) to it. If you think RAM is something you use to knock down a door or something you can download for free, this article will set you straight.</p>

<h2 align="left">How RAM Works</h2>

<p align="left">Your PC has two types of memory  RAM and the hard drive. Items loaded into RAM are instantly accessible, but items stored on the hard drive are not because the drive head must seek them first. When you start up an application, it loads key portions into RAM so the program will run as quickly as possible. Items in RAM are present until the power is turned off; items on your hard drive stay there whether the power is on or off.</p>

<p align="left">If you only use your computer for Internet surfing, email and simple word processing, the amount of RAM your computer was initially loaded with will probably be adequate. However, if you want to keep many programs open while you are working on a project, need to render graphics, photos and videos, or want to enjoy the latest games without having them slow down, 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/setup/addmemory.aspx">Microsoft recommends</a> adding at least 2 gigabytes of RAM to your computer for the best performance.</p>

<h2 align="left">What Type of RAM Does Your PC Use?</h2>

<p align="left">The most common RAM used in PCs today is DDR SDRAM (double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory). It comes in three versions: DDR, DDR2 and DDR3; each version is faster and uses less power than earlier ones. DDR is not used today, and DDR2 is being phased out by DDR3. The main thing to know is you cannot mix different types of RAM  a PC built with DDR2 memory cant support DDR3 memory.</p>

<p align="left">The easiest way to identify the type of RAM your computer uses is to visit the Staples 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/resources/memory/index.html">Find the Right Memory</a> page; you can also check your computers manual, do an Internet search or look directly at the RAM in your machine.</p>

<h2 align="left">Determine the Amount of RAM in Your PC</h2>

<ul>

<li>Windows 7: In the 
<strong>Start Menu</strong>, enter the word RAM into the search field and choose 
<strong>Show how much RAM is on this computer</strong>.
<strong></strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Apple Macintosh: Open 
<strong>About This Mac</strong> in the Apple menu on the top left of your screen and it will say how much and what type of RAM you have.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">RAM modules are typically sold in these sizes: 1GB, 2GB and 4GB. Most of todays computers can upgrade to 8GB of RAM.</p>

<h2 align="left">Installing RAM</h2>

<p align="left">The easiest way to install RAM is to have it done at Staples when you purchase the RAM there. If you decide to do it yourself, follow these general steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Work in a static-free area and confirm that you are grounded at all times.</li>

<li>Manipulate the RAM modules by their plastic edges. Dont touch the metal parts.</li>

<li>Unplug your PC and open its case.</li>

<li>Locate your RAM module slots. Most computers have two or four RAM slots located on the motherboard, one or more of which may be empty.</li>

<li>If there is an empty slot, place the new RAM in it. Gently push it into place until the clips lock into it.</li>

<li>If you need to remove an old memory module, slowly push the clip open and remove the chip. Place the new module in its place.</li>

<li>Repeat this as needed to install all your memory.</li>

<li>Close the computer and restart it.</li>

<li>If the installation succeeded, your PC will start up and you should notice a speed increase when you start and use programs.</li>
</ol>

<p align="left">The latest version of Windows is a far cry from its predecessors. Learn more about the updates and new features that make it the most advanced version of Windows to date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Windows often has the reputation of being the workhorse operating system. Apple OS X gets the credit for the visual bells and whistles, while PC users are stuck with a drab Windows 7. The truth is far different. There are a few reasons why Windows 7 still sits atop the heap, and one of them is how far the OS has come in terms of productivity and fun. Yes, Windows can be fun and easy to use! Heres why.</p>

<ol>

<li>
<strong>The taskbar</strong> has been totally redesigned to use less screen real estate and provide more functionality. For instance, you can pin and arrange your necessary applications, documents and Web sites on the taskbar so they are available for launching at any time. When you hover the cursor over a taskbar button for a program that is running, you will see a thumbnail preview of whats open.</li>

<li>
<strong>Aero Peek</strong> is a great tool to use when screen real estate is valuable. If you have multiple windows open and you need to find something under them, hover your cursor over the right end of the taskbar and youll see the words Show desktop. Click this, and all the open windows become hidden, presenting a clean view of the icons, files and folders currently living on your desktop.</li>

<li>
<strong>Aero Snap</strong> automatically maximizes and resizes windows when you drag a window to an edge of the screen. With one movement you can have a single window fill the screen or, with two movements, you can snap together two windows that fill the screen, side by side, to quickly compare them. Drag a window again, and it returns to its original size.</li>

<li>
<strong>Aero Shake</strong> is a cool way to manage a lot of open windows, too. Just click and hold the cursor on the window you want to use, shake it back and forth, and the other windows automatically hide as the one you shook comes forward.</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows Search</strong> is a fast and thorough way to find files. It provides immediate feedback to you; as soon as you start typing, you get a list of files on your PC that match the letters you type.</li>

<li>
<strong>HomeGroup </strong>makes it a snap to create and join home networks, so the whole family can share files and printers. This feature also lets you watch and share movies, music, photos and videos that are on one PC with any device on the network that is running Windows 7. If you have an XBox 360, you can wirelessly connect it to your PC and watch media stored on your computer. HomeGroup lets you adjust the security settings for every item you decide to share.</li>

<li>
<strong>Windows Live Essentials</strong> is a bundle of programs that enable you to easily organize, manipulate and create photos, videos and blogs. Additionally, it provides you with tools for managing multiple email accounts and parental controls.</li>

<li>
<strong>Device Stage</strong> makes it easy to connect and configure printers, cameras, phones, music and other devices. Just plug a device into your PC and Device Stage shows you all the menus and options for using that device in one window.</li>
</ol>

<p align="left">These eight features only skim the surface of the many that are engineered into Windows 7. If you want to learn more or ask any questions about Windows, every Staples store has a certified Microsoft Advisor on staff to help you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It can be tough to keep up with the latest threats to your computer's security. Here's a guide to help you stay in the know and out of trouble.</p></blockquote>

<p>When it comes to computing, its a dangerous world out there. Virus developers and other bad guys are relentless in trying to capture user information and destroy systems. Even more challenging, the landscape is constantly changing. As security application developers come up with stronger protection, attackers change tactics and start new battles.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the top dangers to keep in mind, with input from three of our EasyTech experts:</p>

<h2>Rogue Antivirus</h2>

<p>According to EasyTech expert Ryan Salinger, one of the worst threats these days is rogueware, which promises to rid a computer of malicious software (malware).</p>

<p>Often disguised as a virus scan, this threat will display a message with an ominous warning. For example: Virus has been blocked, click here to remove or Multiple viruses detected, click here to run scan. Once you click on the window, a piece of software is covertly installed on your PC. This malware will usually block most attempts to open other programs or to close the virus program itself. Meanwhile, on the screen, youre prompted to pay for virus removal services.</p>

<p>When a credit card number has been put in, youve simply handed over your personal information on a silver platter to some fake company or person, typically overseas, says Salinger. If that wasnt bad enough, your PC will still be infected.</p>

<p>In 2010, Google reported that 11,000 Web site domains were hosting this type of fake antivirus software. Most have names (such as DriveCleaner and WinFixer) that sound similar to legitimate products.</p>

<p>EasyTech expert Shawn Dube notes that his own grandmother was taken in by this type of scam: It really preys on peoples anxiety about computer viruses, he says. This particular type of malware is so tenacious, and it just keeps adapting and changing.</p>

<h2>Are you fighting a rogue? Telltale signs:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Frequent pop-up windows warn you about rampant viruses.</li>

<li>Links direct you to a Web site where youre asked to provide credit card information.</li>

<li>Youre redirected to other Web sites while online.</li>

<li>Its difficult to do everyday tasks, like opening applications or saving documents.</li>

<li>You cant close or uninstall a program.</li>

<li>You cant access legitimate antivirus Web sites like Symantec or BitDefender.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shut them down:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Dont click through on any error message that seems suspicious, particularly if it directs you to a Web site. Legitimate antivirus makers don't use random screenings to get business.</li>

<li>Never give your credit-card information online for virus scanning and eradication unless youve researched the software company first.</li>

<li>Do a Google search on the company name along with the word scam. For example, DriveCleaner scam will bring up some information about whether the app is fake.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spyware</h2>

<p>Imagine all of your computers data in the hands of someone else  a person who knows exactly what you type, every day. Sounds scary, but it happens often, according to EasyTech expert Mark Gratton. This type of malware is called spyware, because it spies on a users behavior and reports back to the malware developer.</p>

<p>Its there to get your sensitive information, says Gratton, It doesnt affect performance, and it doesnt send out pop-up messages, so you probably wont get an indication that its there.</p>

<p>Many types of spyware spider out, he adds, which means that they create a spiders web of information within the computer and put code in numerous areas. This makes it much harder for an average user to remove all of it. If only part of it is eradicated, whats left can keep moving behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Also, spyware can reside in files that are important for computer operations, Gratton notes. That means those files cant be deleted; the code has to be tweezed out in very specific ways that wont harm the existing data.</p>

<p>One of the most common types of spyware is called a keylogger. This program will track your keystrokes on the computer, and then send a file to the rogue programmer with that information. Think about everything you type in during the day  passwords to bank sites, emails to friends, tax data into a spreadsheet  and thats what the hacker will get.</p>

<p>Only about 10 percent of malware is designed to spy on you in this way, but its really dangerous for those affected by it, Gratton says.</p>

<p>A type of spyware thats less scary will look at your online habits as you surf the Web and then deliver ads based on what youve been browsing, adds Salinger.</p>

<p>He says, The spyware creators are going after revenue dollars. Most sites, like Google, offer a pay-per-click service, which gives the person placing an ad a very small amount of money for every ad clicked. This may not seem like much, but if 100,000 people are infected, it could lead to some very promising revenue.</p>

<h2>Are you harboring a spy? Telltale signs:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Youre seeing more shopping toolbars, pop-up windows or browser extensions. These give spyware creators access to see what youre doing online.</li>

<li>With keyloggers, there wont be any signs, Gratton notes. Thats why its important to do a regular antivirus and security checkup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shut them down:</h2>

<ul>

<li>For spyware, there are methods for finding and eradicating the programs yourself. But if there were ever a time to call in a professional, this is it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Email Viruses</h2>

<p>Probably the least harmless of the security threats that hit a computer, email viruses can still be annoying to users and their friends.</p>

<p>These viruses work by guessing the password to an email client and then using the program to send out messages that claim to be from you. The emails have links that lead to malware sites.</p>

<p>Dube notes that his Hotmail account got hacked in this way, and the emails became rampant. The program sent out fraud messages to everyone hed ever contacted through that account.</p>

<p>I felt like I got hijacked, he says, Definitely, this is one thats a security threat, so it's good to keep on top of it.</p>

<h2>Are you a hijack victim? Telltale signs:</h2>

<ul>

<li>Friends write to tell you that theyre getting weird messages from you, even though you havent sent any.</li>

<li>You may get messages from your own account, usually in the middle of the night, and often with Web links included.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Shut them down:</h2>

<ul>

<li>The only real way to stop these viruses is to implement better password protection. Dube recommends a mix of capital and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. He says, Dont use anything that could be looked up in a dictionary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Prevention and Cleanup Tips</h2>

<p>To keep nasty viruses and other dangers off the computer, be sure to follow good practices when online. Create strong passwords, install all operating system updates, run regular security checks and dont click on pop-up windows.</p>

<p>Most importantly, dont download programs or games from companies you dont know. Be suspicious of email messages with Web links that promise jokes, videos, news or other information, even if those emails come from a friend.</p>

<p>Many users find it helpful to have an automated antivirus and intrusion-detection scan. Install reputable security software and follow the instructions for running scans and disinfection on a regular basis.</p>

<p>In order to get a better look at whats on your computer, Salinger notes, you can do a free online virus scan. These dont remove anything from the PC, but theyre helpful to see the level of infection, if any.</p>

<p>If you suspect your computer has already been infected, its important to clean up the right way. With some viruses and applications  particularly spyware  disinfection is far from simple. Since the virus can replicate and then reside in different parts of the computer, its advisable to have a professional do the work to fully scrub all parts of the malicious code out of the PC.</p>

<p>Security will always be crucial when using your computer. The attackers dont rest, but fortunately, some vigilance can go a long way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Improving your computer's performance can be done in a number of ways, but adding firepower by upgrading or replacing hardware components may be the right move for some.</p></blockquote>

<p>When it comes to boosting a PC's speed, software can only take you so far. Once a machine is cleansed of viruses, defragmented (a tactic that helps put files together) and optimized, it still might not be as speedy as you'd like.</p>

<p>That's where hardware options come in. A number of system enhancements can help to speed up a PC. Common strategies include adding a solid-state drive (SSD) or increasing memory by adding random access memory (RAM) chips.</p>

<p>Here's a look at the pros and cons of going the hardware route.</p>

<h2>Top Advantages</h2>

<p>When it comes to adding hardware, there are three major benefits: zoom, zoom and zoom:</p>

<ul>

<li>If you've been struggling with a sluggish PC, getting more speed will feel like a switch from walking to flying in a jet. Everything loads faster, games don't stall and the computer starts up with a speed you didn't think possible. Once you get a taste of that level of performance, it's tough to go back.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Software options might increase speed an incremental amount, but nothing can match the level of speed that a hardware upgrade makes possible.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Also, hardware tends to come with a capacity increase. For example, adding a new hard drive will boost performance and also allow the computer to store more information. This memory addition will optimize performance of some applications, thanks to the added processing power.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Better hardware may also enhance your ability to work with more processing-hungry applications. Some games, in particular, have very high processor requirements in order to render their 3D effects. Other applications that require more oomph include video-editing suites, audio-editing programs and some system maintenance resources like antivirus scanning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>With more processing power and faster speeds, it's easier to run multiple programs simultaneously. That means you could be playing a game and quickly switch over to a work document when the boss walks in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drawbacks to Consider</h2>

<p>Although hardware fixes are compelling, they do come with challenges as well. Most notably, many computers will need to be taken to a professional for an upgrade (especially if a PC warranty is voidable if the user performs the upgrade).</p>

<p>Professional-level service guarantees the hardware installation is done well, but it also means the PC will be in the shop for at least a day or two. And, even with inexpensive RAM chips, you'll have to pay for labor and any repairs associated with the work.</p>

<p>Another drawback can be unrealistic expectations. Even with stellar hardware, there are limits to how much more speed you'll realize with a system enhancement. If you haven't explored software options as well  such as doing a thorough virus cleaning  the hardware approach may be less effective.</p>

<p>In general, though, enhancing a PC through new hardware can be a real boon. The extra speed means tasks can be completed faster, games load more easily and many other benefits. Are you ready to soup up your PC for the fast lane?</p>

<title>The Hard Knocks of Hard Drive Installation</title>
<description>Installing a new hard drive can seem like a daunting task, but with the right guidance it can be done by just about anyone.</description>

<p>Installing a new hard drive can seem like a daunting task, but with the right guidance it can be done by just about anyone.</p></blockquote>

<p>You dont have to be an IT guru to install your own hard drive, but popping open the PC and doing your own work definitely carries some risks. Here are some basic steps to make installation easier, safer and more effective.</p>

<p>One thing to note: These are steps for adding a SATA drive, which will improve system performance and storage capacity. If you're using a PATA drive (also known as an IDE hard drive), which is an older style of hard drive, the process is slightly different.</p>

<ol start="1">

<li>
<strong>Get your tools ready.</strong> Most likely, youll only need a Phillips screwdriver or a medium flat-blade screwdriver. Check the screws on the case before starting.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">

<li>
<strong>Ground yourself.</strong> To prevent electric shocks, consider wearing an antistatic wristband. Also, keep one hand on a metal part of the case if possible. Another safety precaution is to place the computer on a foam pad (these pads  which look like something you might slip under a sleeping bag while camping  help prevent electric shock).</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">

<li>
<strong>Power down your PC and unplug it from the wall.</strong> Wait about 10 to 15 seconds so the motherboard's capacitors can discharge. Then, remove the screws holding the sides of the case and very carefully slide the panels out of the way.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">

<li>
<strong>If youre replacing a drive, unplug the power and data cables and unscrew the drive.</strong> This will release it from its cage. Carefully remove it so that it doesnt bump into other internal components.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">

<li>
<strong>Put the new drive into the cage and secure it tightly with screws.</strong> Make sure theres enough room around the cage so that air can flow freely. This will help ensure the drive will be adequately cooled when its running.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">

<li>
<strong>Plug in the data cable to the motherboard on the first available SATA channel.</strong> The motherboard  the thin component with various plugs and diagrams  looks something like an aerial view of a city. The SATA channels are rectangular and resemble upside-down Lego blocks. Usually, theyre marked with SATA1, SATA2 and SATA3, depending on the motherboard. If youre replacing a drive, plug your new drive into SATA1. If youre adding a drive, connect it to the next available channel.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="7">

<li>
<strong>Plug in a power connector to the drive.</strong> This may come with the drive, or you could use the one from the drive youre replacing. With some drives, the power connector is on the same cord as the data cable. Refer to your drives manual or specifications to determine the best configuration and proper placement for the power connector.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="8">

<li>
<strong>Take a look around to make sure youve put everything back into place, including cables you might have moved.</strong> Then replace the sides of your case, plug in the PC and boot up the machine. The drive should be recognized, and you can double-check its status by using 
<strong>Device Manager</strong> in the 
<strong>Hardware</strong> folder of the 
<strong>Control Panel</strong> in Windows.</li>
</ol>

<p>Like any task involving PC hardware, installing a drive takes focus and precision, so give yourself ample time. Also, be sure to have tech support numbers ready and back up your data before you start. Who knows? You could be on your way to being an IT guru after all.</p>

<title>Eight Tips for Safer Web Browsing</title>
<description>How safe is your PC while web browsing? Check out these easy web-browsing tips for you and your family! </description>

<p align="left">How safe is your PC while web browsing? Check out these easy web-browsing tips for you and your family!</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Browsing the Internet is like being a tourist visiting New Yorks Times Square: you are in a hustling, bustling place full of interesting people, stores and things to do. But youre also in a place where you need to keep your guard up and be aware of your surroundings, particularly if you have children in your care.</p>

<p align="left">Follow these tips for safe web browsing and make your Internet visits safe and enjoyable:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Double-check information from the Web.</strong> Not everything you see (such as a mutant cat) or read (such as an email allegedly from American Airlines) is true because its online.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Be with your children as they learn to use the Internet.</strong> Sit beside them as they start browsing the Web. Share your thoughts about what is good online behavior, and encourage them to tell you about anything they think is suspicious.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Dont reveal much personal information.</strong> Protect yourself from identity theft and other threats to your privacy by limiting the amount of personal information you share online.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Vet Web sites before visiting them.</strong> Google has a tool that allows you to check Web sites to see if they are infected or distribute malware. In your browser, enter 
<a href="http://google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=www.example.com">http://google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=www.example.com</a> (replace www.example.com with the web address you wish to test). Google will generate a report outlining any security concerns on the site.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Be careful of free stuff. </strong>When you see an offer for a free download from a company you dont know, the best thing to do is not click on anything in that window. This is especially true of any pop-up window that says your computer has a virus  dont click anything except the red X in the top right that closes the window. In Windows 7 you can also hold down the 
<strong>Alt Key</strong> and press 
<strong>F4</strong> to force-close it, or just quit the browser and restart with a fresh window.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Watch out for malicious Web sites and sites that mimic real sites.</strong> The good news is that most current browsers identify and warn you that a site might be hacked. If you get such a message, the best thing to do is to not visit the site. Sites can be designed so that just by visiting them you contract a virus or malware. If you see a page refresh and change while you are reading it, or it redirects you to a different page when you didnt click on anything, close the page and restart the browser.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Beware of email scams.</strong> As a result of visiting a hacked Web site, or because your email address is in a hackers database, you may receive email that looks official but isnt. Look for signs of forgery. For instance, PayPal always uses your first and last name in its email greetings, so a generic greeting (Dear Customer) should be a flag that this is not from PayPal. If the email has a return address that is not official, report it to the genuine company and delete it without opening.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Dont open any attachments or follow any instructions in suspicious email, especially from people you dont know. </strong>And, be wary of any emails from known contacts that have suspicious content, such as an email from a colleague that is full of spelling errors and nonsense phrases.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">The Internet, like New York, never sleeps and is full of great things waiting to be discovered by you. By practicing safe web browsing, youll be able to enjoy  site seeing without getting hurt.</p>

<p>Setting up a new PC can be a daunting task, especially if this is your first one.  This list of 10 steps should provide some helpful guidance in getting your new system up and running.</p></blockquote>

<p>Congratulations! Youre the new owner of a new PC laptop or desktop. This is a proud, technologically awesome day for you and yours. Even with all that excitement, however, you might be asking yourself a very intimidating question:</p>

<p>What happens now?</p>

<p>This is a completely normal question to ask. Although it would be great if a PC could spring to life and set up itself, that's not happening anytime soon. Instead of waiting for that futuristic moment to arrive, consider this guide. By following the 10 simple setup tips for new PCs contained within, you'll be feeling high-tech in no time. Lets begin:</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Location, location.</strong> Select a good location. Moving a desktop PC once it's up and running isn't fun, so choose an ideal spot first thing. Look for a space that's close to an outlet or allows for a surge-protected extension cord. There should be room in the back of the table or desk for cables that connect the monitor to the central processing unit (CPU). Think about ergonomics, too: Will you be comfortable in this location? Is the table or desk in a spot where glare from windows (the house kind) will leave you squinting? Adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>
<strong>2. Inventory.</strong> Take everything out of the box, and put all the equipment and accessories in the same place. You'd be surprised how often people take a PC out, but leave keyboards behind or misplace the instruction manual. Double-check that you have every cable and part listed on the included PC manufacturer's sheet.</p>

<p>
<strong>3. Unwrapped and cable-free. </strong>Unwrap all the parts, remove any protective plastic covers from the monitor and CPU, and arrange everything the way that you'd like. But don't try to connect any cables (yet).</p>

<p>
<strong>4. OK, now the cables. </strong>Cables are trickier than they seem, even though manufacturers are very helpful with their color-coding systems. Follow the instructions in the user's manual, and 
<em>take it slow</em>. Connecting cables properly is an important step, and there's no need to rush through it. Make sure that peripherals like keyboard and mouse are plugged in properly as well.</p>

<p>
<strong>5. Plug-n-play.</strong> Plug in the PC to the outlet or, even better, a power strip with a surge protector. This type of strip helps prevent damage to the CPU that might be caused by voltage spikes, lightning or other power interruptions.</p>

<p>
<strong>6. Houston, we have power.</strong> Now you should be ready for takeoff. Push the power button on your CPU and then the power button on your monitor. This is always an exciting moment, so savor it!</p>

<p>
<strong>7. Boots and names.</strong> With the system on for the first time, the PC will boot up with a few welcome screens. One of them is likely to ask you to input a profile or user account. This can be anything you like, from a nickname to your actual name. 
<strong>Remember</strong>: The computer will use this name moving forward, so carefully consider whether you really want to be called "PookyBear" for the next few years.</p>

<p>
<strong>8. Family, friends and coworkers.</strong> At this point, you can also add other profiles for family members or friends, or leave that task for later.</p>

<p>
<strong>9. Get connected.</strong> You may see a prompt for connecting to the Internet, and if so, go ahead and follow those steps. If a prompt doesn't appear, you can set up your Internet connection by using a Microsoft tool called 
<strong>Connect to the Internet wizard.</strong> For Windows 7, you can reach this tool by clicking the 
<strong>Start button</strong>, then 
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type 
<strong>network.</strong> Click on 
<strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>, then 
<strong>Set up a new connection or network.</strong> Next, double-click on the option to 
<strong>Connect to the Internet</strong>, and you should be good to go.</p>

<p>
<strong>10. Kick the tires.</strong> Get to know each other. Familiarize yourself with the different aspects of your new computer. Take a spin through the Control Panel we visited earlier to see what options are available to you. Your Windows PC also includes a few free preinstalled games and programs, so be sure to check those out as well. Above all, have fun!</p>

<title>The Beginner's Guide to Windows Service Packs</title>
<description>While they can be time consuming, service packs offer and overhaul of security enhancements and performance improvements throughout the life of the operating system.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>While they can be time consuming, service packs offer and overhaul of security enhancements and performance improvements throughout the life of the operating system.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, the humble Microsoft Windows Service Pack. As a software update for your PC its not something you can touch or see, but it is nonetheless an integral part of the Windows operating system experience. You need to respect, not fear, the Windows Service Pack.</p>

<p>Why? Its simple: Understanding the basics of what a service pack is and what it can do for your PC will lead to better security, reliability and peace of mind. In other words: This is important! But please, dont be intimidated. Were here to help.</p>

<h2>Service Pack Basics</h2>

<p>Service packs are free updates to the Microsoft Windows operating system you already have installed on your PC. Besides being free, each pack often includes a menagerie of security and performance improvements for any new hardware or gadgets you may have purchased along the way.</p>

<p>For example, a recent service pack for Windows 7 included improved reliability for connecting to HDMI audio devices and better printing when using the XPS viewer (which is used to view certain types of documents and file formats on your PC). The update also corrected some issues with restoring folders after a restart of Windows Explorer.</p>

<h2>Why You Need Them</h2>

<p>Windows doesnt require service packs in order to run, which leads some users to delay or even skip installation. A better strategy is to stay up-to-date on service pack releases, because theyre loaded with important updates that can keep your system more secure and user-friendly. Here are just a few benefits they provide:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Improved security:</strong> Just as hackers are constantly trying to find a way into Windows, Microsoft is continually finding methods for keeping them out. Service packs include the latest security strategies and tools that can run in the background to prevent intrusions automatically.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Better performance:</strong> Microsoft developers are always looking for ways to make the operating system faster, more compatible with outside applications and more robust. Service packs incorporate their changes so that your system will work better in the future.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Hardware support:</strong> Various devices  smartphones, music players, external DVD players and basically anything else that can be plugged into the computer  all require a level of compatibility to talk with the operating system. Service packs usually include support for the newest types of hardware, reducing compatibility issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Download and Installation Tips</h2>

<p>When youre ready to install a service pack, set some time aside for the task. Most installations take about 30 minutes to complete. Since a computer must be restarted about halfway through the installation, be sure to close all applications and documents (
<em>don't forget to save first</em>), so that the restart and installation will be quicker.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get service packs is to turn on Windows Update for Windows 7 and Windows Vista, or Automatic Updates for Windows XP.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>For Windows 7 Update</strong>, go to the 
<a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Update Web site</a>. If automatic updating is already turned on, Windows Update in your computers Control Panel will open and show the systems update status. If its not on, the Web site tool will guide you through the steps to do so.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>For Automatic Windows XP Updates</strong>, 
<a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/">visit the same Web site</a>, being sure to use Internet Explorer as the Web browser. On the right side of the page, the current status of Automatic Updates will be displayed. If it indicates that its turned off, simply click Turn on Automatic Updates.</li>
</ul>

<p>By switching on automated update services, Microsoft will notify you whenever service packs are ready to install and will guide you through the process.</p>

<p>If you want to keep Microsoft Windows running strong and protected, make sure regular service pack updates become part of your routine.</p>

<p>From cleaning house to installing new hardware, there are a host of things you can do to get your PC in the fast lane.</p></blockquote>

<p>How fast do you want to go? Getting more speed from a PC is always a compelling goal, but you may encounter hurdles in trying to go from slow crawl to hyperspace.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are proven ways to pack your PC with more speed without hitting the roadblocks.</p>

<h2>Free Speed Boosts</h2>

<p>Cleaning up your PC's software and documents is like getting more space in your office by tidying the desk and filing cabinets: While any given aspect of the cleanup may not have a big impact, the overall effect will make you more efficient and productive. Another bonus is that many software cleanup tasks involve either low-cost tools or none at all.</p>

<p>Here are a few tips for tuning up:</p>

<ul>

<li>Remove software, games, documents, music, photos and videos that you don't use anymore. This can be time consuming, but you'd be surprised at how much memory gets taken up by large files like games and videos. For some software, you may need to use an uninstaller program to scrape them out of your drive.</li>

<li>Do deeper virus and spyware cleaning with your existing antivirus programs. Although these applications do regular, automatic checks, many have advanced functionality for doing more extensive scans. Set aside some time for a thorough virus cleaning.</li>

<li>Defragment your hard drive. Fragmentation is a normal part of computing. As you save files, parts of them get stored on the drive in different areas. These fragments need to be pulled together when they're retrieved, which means the computer has to search for all the pieces  and that can take time. Use a disk-defragmentation application to consolidate the fragments and speed up your operations.</li>

<li>Check the resources at Microsoft, particularly system upgrades, disk-cleanup utilities and ReadyBoost, an application that adds memory to a system. 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/maintenance/speed.aspx">This handy Web page</a> is a good starting point.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hardware Store</h2>

<p>Software cleanup and upgrades can be hugely helpful for speeding up a PC, but those tactics can only take you so far. Sometimes, a computer needs some new hardware to really get the engine running. Here are some hardware options:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Random access memory (RAM) chips</strong> increase the amount of memory the computer can access. That means applications that take up a chunk of memory  e.g., games, video-editing programs and conferencing programs  will be able to work more efficiently.</li>

<li>
<strong>Solid-state drives</strong> (SSDs) can be good options because they use flash memory to operate. That lowers the chance of failure or breakdown compared with a standard hard drive. SSDs bring significant speed enhancements without increased power use and are particularly good for laptops and tablet PCs.</li>

<li>
<strong>External desktop drives</strong> reside outside your computer, and many are portable. They have large capacities so you can transfer a huge amount of files and increase the storage space on your PC.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Service Call</h2>

<p>Boosting speed and performance can be as easy as leaving your computer with a qualified professional. Staples EasyTech offers an affordable PC tune-up where a technician removes trialware (the "free trial" programs that can gunk up a computer), adjusts key settings, does disk defragmentation and cleanup, and even removes excess dust.</p>

<p>In some cases, a computer can be riddled with viruses, spyware and adware (see glossary below). Antivirus programs are helpful, but only if they can run  some PCs are so infected that they can't even start up these applications. EasyTech offers a virus/spyware/adware removal service that diagnoses the extent of the problem and cleans the system.</p>

<p>If the system still seems sluggish after you've done a series of software and hardware tweaks, EasyTech has a diagnostic service that checks hardware and performs a system analysis. This will identify any software-related issues along with any hardware failures or conflicts. (Sometimes, a seemingly minor interoperability issue can cause widespread slowdown.)</p>

<p>Having a professional check for issues and do a general tune-up can not only speed up a PC now, but also prevent problems in the future.</p>

<h2>Watch Out: Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>

<p>When doing any kind of work on a PC  cleanup, installation of hardware and even taking the computer in for service  keep in mind issues like these:</p>

<ul>

<li>During software cleanup, be 100 percent certain about what to delete. If you don't recognize an application, take the time to research it online to make sure it's not necessary for system start-up and operations. Countless PC users have trashed a crucial app for start-up and then couldn't get their computers to boot up.</li>

<li>Before doing any kind of maintenance work, back up your files. You should do this regularly anyway, using either a separate drive or an online service. But making triple-sure the files are stored off your computer will prevent heartache over data loss later.</li>

<li>We mentioned backing up your files, right? Seriously, make sure they're safe. It's surprising how many people don't do this task because they "don't have the time." However, think about how long it would take you to get back to normal operations if you were to lose everything.</li>

<li>When doing hardware installations like secondary drives, check your warranty first to make sure you wouldn't be voiding it by opening your computer's case. If this does void the warranty, bring the PC to a professional technician instead.</li>

<li>If you decide to do the hardware installation yourself, read up on how to prevent static-electricity jolts while doing the work. These electrical discharges can be uncomfortable for you  and deadly for a PC's sensitive electronics.</li>

<li>When all software, hardware and service options have been explored, you'll probably be at the maximum speed for your machine. For some people, this still won't feel fast enough. But be patient, because the next super speedy PC technology is likely in development.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Top Terms to Know</h2>

<p>Here are the most common terms you'll find when taking on a speed and optimization project:</p>

<p>
<em>Serial ATA:</em> Some internal hard drives involve the use of Serial ATA, also known as SATA or Serial Advanced Technology Attachment. This is a system that allows for data transfer between components in a computer, particularly for connecting storage devices like hard drives and optical drives to each other. Basically, SATA gives components in a computer the same language so they can communicate. And who doesn't appreciate such a skilled translator?</p>

<p>
<em>Spyware and adware: </em>Spyware is a malicious program that's designed to hurt your system or to obtain personal information from you (e.g., usernames and passwords) for identity theft. Adware doesn't have that level of evil intention, but instead collects information like Web surfing habits so that marketers can send you more targeted ads. Although the latter is usually harmless, both types of unauthorized software can slow your computer significantly. Regularly cleaning these, as well as trialware, can keep your computer zooming along.</p>

<p>
<em>Service packs: </em>These updates to the Microsoft Windows operating system are designed to make the system more reliable and efficient. Provided free, they usually include multiple security and performance improvements as well as support for newer hardware. Windows doesn't need service packs to run. However, by keeping up-to-date on service pack releases, you'll get improved security, better performance and more interoperability.</p>

<p>
<em>Flash memory:</em> This type of computer storage can be erased and written over, making it useful for both short-term and long-term data storage. It's usually found in memory cards, solid-state drives, USB flash drives and other storage products. Using flash memory helps to keep a computer speedy, since the data on it can be "read" quickly.</p>

<p>
<em>ReadyBoost:</em> A free resource from Microsoft, this handy tool helps to speed up your system by using nonvolatile flash memory (like from a USB flash drive) to improve performance. And you don't even need to add more memory. Check out 
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-ReadyBoost-on-or-off-for-a-storage-device">this page</a> for instructions on how to use ReadyBoost with Windows 7.</p>

<p>With software, hardware and service options, packing your PC with more speed can be straightforward and effective. Although you'll need to set aside some time initially for cleanup, installation or in-store professional tune-ups, the speed you gain will be more than worth the effort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basic optimization of your Windows 7 installation can lead to a more efficient, snappy PC experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Windows 7 has many updated features compared to its predecessors. So if youre excited about spiffing up the system even more, we dont blame you.</p>

<p>Heres a look at installation and beyond for Windows 7, including system advantages and some tips for optimization.</p>

<h2>Clean Install</h2>

<p>Its hard to resist a fresh start. If your PC is older or has had Windows 7 for a while, it may be time for a clean installation of the system.</p>

<p>This process can help eliminate some of the trial programs, freeware and utilities (a.k.a. bloatware) that slow a computer and hurt its stability. Other advantages to a clean install are faster start-up times and better performance.</p>

<p>In order to do a clean install, youll need the Windows 7 disk that accompanied your desktop or laptop. Also, make a list of hardware youve added since the first install so you can find the right drivers. A good trick for keeping track of drivers is to find them on the system or through manufacturer support sites, and then download the drivers to a DVD or USB flash drive. That way, youll always have them handy in case anything needs to be tweaked with the system. This will also make reinstallation much easier and faster.</p>

<p>Clean installations of Windows 7 take longer and are more involved than simply updating the system, especially since drivers must be reloaded. But because the whole drive is refreshed, theres less chance of any data corruption and systems tend to have fewer problems in the long run.</p>

<h2>Faster Boot Times</h2>

<p>Although long boot times might seem like a minor annoyance, they can actually harm PC performance. Optimizing boot time will make your system more efficient in numerous ways. The most frequent causes of sluggish boot time are antivirus programs and applications that involve automatic updates.</p>

<p>Some software apps put files in your Startup folder and will update whenever you restart or boot up. Although this can be beneficial for some apps, its not necessary for most. Depending on whats installed, this tactic can slow boot time by up to a minute. Antivirus programs, too, tend to reside in the Startup folder. Upon boot-up, they often scan the system for viruses that may have been downloaded since the last restart.</p>

<p>To optimize, first look at your Configuration file. This can be found by pressing the 
<strong>WinKey</strong> and the letter 
<strong>R</strong> simultaneously, bringing up the Run command. Then, type msconfig into the box and hit 
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip: </strong>To decrease boot time, first uncheck 
<strong>GUI Boot</strong> so you can skip the colorful splash screens that accompany system and software start-ups. Then, reduce the delay time to three seconds. Click on 
<strong>OK</strong>, and then 
<strong>Apply</strong>. When you restart, it should boot up a bit faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>For even more optimization, begin some cleanup. Remove any unused services by again pressing the 
<strong>WinKey</strong> and 
<strong>R</strong> for the Run command. Type in services.msc and press 
<strong>OK</strong>. Double-click on each service name that comes up to determine if you use it or not.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip: </strong>Some common services that can usually be disabled include Remote Registry, Windows Error Reporting, Offline Files and Tablet PC Input Service (unless youre using a tablet PC).</li>
</ul>

<p>After that, determine which start-up programs actually need to launch when you boot up. Ideal programs for this category are those you use frequently (e.g., an instant messaging program if you frequently IM). In contrast, an app like QuickTime probably doesnt need to be in the Start-up folder unless you use it immediately after booting up.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip: </strong>Take a good look at what launches when you boot up and consider whether its needed. Shifting apps from the Start-up folder to the Applications folder can sometimes boost boot times significantly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another quick tip is to remove any unused fonts. Even if youre a designer, you likely dont need many of the hundreds of fonts that are in your system. Fonts take up more room than most people think, so cleaning them out can be beneficial.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Tip: </strong>To get rid of unwanted fonts, click 
<strong>Start</strong>, then 
<strong>Settings</strong>, then 
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. Double-click the font icon (it looks like a capital 
<strong>A</strong> in an open file folder). This will bring up a screen with all of your fonts. Simply click on the ones you dont use and hit 
<strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Better Performance</h2>

<p>Making performance tweaks to a system can result in optimization or...well, no discernable difference at all. Sometimes, these changes must be made as part of a group of tweaks to be effective. So if you dont see improvements from one tactic, be patient and see if more changes produce the results you seek.</p>

<p>One of the top performance changes is disabling search indexing. This feature is automatically turned on in Windows 7, but most users will find it unnecessary since they know where to find their files. Unless you use the Search command for the system regularly, turn off search indexing to get a performance boost.</p>

<p>To disable it, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>

<li>Right-click on the 
<strong>Windows Orb</strong> in the bottom right of the screen.</li>

<li>Select 
<strong>Properties/Start Menu</strong>, then 
<strong>Customize</strong>.</li>

<li>Deselect the button for Search Programs and Control Panel.</li>

<li>Select the button for Dont Search in the category of Search Other Files and Libraries.</li>

<li>Click 
<strong>WinKey</strong> and 
<strong>R</strong> simultaneously, and type services.msc before clicking on 
<strong>Windows Search</strong> and disabling it.</li>

<li>Click 
<strong>Start Menu/Computer</strong> and right-click on 
<strong>Local Disk C</strong>. Uncheck the box for indexing.</li>

<li>Reboot the computer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another performance enhancement tactic is to uninstall features and Windows programs that arent needed. Getting rid of unused programs saves space and boosts speed. To get a list of programs, left-click on the 
<strong>Windows Orb</strong> and go to 
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then 
<strong>Programs and Features</strong>. Look through the list and decide whats used, and then turn off the ones that are unnecessary.</p>

<p>If youre unsure about what you use, do some research on the programs. For example, a Windows feature called Remote Differential Compression (RDC) monitors changes in files so that they can be transferred over a network with minimal compression. Unless you frequently compress and transfer files, RDC is probably unnecessary. In fact, it slows system speed as it does its monitoring work.</p>

<p>Other performance-enhancement tactics include ensuring all hardware drivers are updated and changing power settings to high-performance mode.</p>

<h2>Desktop Organization</h2>

<p>Although you can create a pleasant look for your computer environment, it sometimes comes at the cost of performance. Adjusting your desktops appearance may reduce the visual appeal, but the performance boost will make it worth the change.</p>

<p>To disable some of the snazzy appearance upgrades in Windows 7, go to System Properties by pressing 
<strong>WinKey</strong> and
<strong> Pause/Break</strong> (located at the upper right corner of the keyboard). Click on 
<strong>Advanced System Settings</strong>, then 
<strong>Advanced</strong> and finally 
<strong>Settings</strong>. Select the button for 
<strong>Best Performance</strong>. This will cut down on the usage of visual effects.</p>

<p>You can also speed up the rate at which a menu pops up, which is nice if you like to work at a quick pace. This control is in the registry, an area of the computer that causes discomfort for some people because it contains so many important functions.</p>

<p>If this fix makes you a little jumpy, skip it. But if youre feeling adventurous, here's what to do:</p>

<ul>

<li>Press 
<strong>WinKey</strong> and 
<strong>R</strong> simultaneously, then type Regedit to go to the Registry Editor.</li>

<li>Follow the path of HKEY_CURRENT_USER to Control Panel and then to Desktop and find MenuShowDelay. This will display a number that represents the milliseconds between selecting a menu and having it pop up.</li>

<li>You can change the number to anywhere between one and 4,000. Select your desired number and click 
<strong>OK</strong>.</li>

<li>You may need to restart to see the effects of this change.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security Features</h2>

<p>Although its best to have as much security as possible, some security functions may not be used as often as youd think.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to eliminate logon screens to speed up your boot time, you can disable them in a few easy steps:</p>

<ul>

<li>Press 
<strong>WinKey</strong> and 
<strong>R</strong> simultaneously.</li>

<li>Type netplwiz and hit 
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li>

<li>Uncheck 
<strong>Users Must Enter a User Name and Password to Use This Computer</strong> and press 
<strong>Apply</strong>.</li>

<li>Enter your username and password to confirm, then hit 
<strong>OK</strong>. Your logon requirements now should be disabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another feature that many people find tiresome is the Are you sure? types of prompts that come up with every system change or program installation. These can be helpful in the case of unwanted downloads. In most cases, though, they just slow down the process of installing apps.</p>

<p>Adjust the level of prompts by left-clicking on the 
<strong>Windows Orb</strong>, and then 
<strong>Icon</strong> on the 
<strong>Start</strong> menu. Click 
<strong>Change User Account Control Settings</strong>, and youll see a scale based on how much protection you want. Choose what feels right for you.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other optimization tactics, as well as cool tips and tricks at sites like

<blockquote>
<p>With the right combination of quality hardware and useful software applications, today's office PC can handle almost any business function.</p></blockquote>

<p>What's more important: keeping your budget in check or having great applications that boost productivity?</p>

<p>Trick question! You can do both, thanks to these affordable business tools for your office PC.</p>

<h2>Accounting and Finance</h2>

<p>Every business needs sharp financial savvy; sometimes, that can come in the form of a great application. The trick to choosing affordable accounting software is buying only as much as you need. Plenty of packages on the market boast tons of features. But if you're not going to use all that functionality, you're spending too much. Boost productivity with an appropriately sized application for your business.</p>

<p>
<em>Example:</em> 
<strong>QuickBooks Pro 2012</strong>, a wildly popular program that you can set up quickly and learn with ease. Organize your business finances, get records together for taxes, create invoices and integrate with spreadsheet program 
<strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>.</p>

<h2>Small Business Packages</h2>

<p>When it comes to operations, small and microsized businesses comprising 1020 employees have very specific needs. Look for software packages that specifically mention phrases like small businesses or SMBs and include features like design options, document preparation, calendar organization and billing functions.</p>

<p>
<em>Example:</em> 
<strong>Small Business Advantage 3</strong>, an affordable package of tools that allows companies to write an employee handbook, create a logo, design business cards and more.</p>

<h2>Antivirus Security and Identity Protection</h2>

<p>When viruses or hackers get into a system, productivity grinds to a halt. On the other hand, an overzealous antivirus program can be just as annoying if its constantly running security checks that interfere with an employees workflow. A well-rounded PC must have strong protection that can work in the 
<em>background</em> without affecting processing speed or business operations. When choosing an application, look for one that addresses a range of areas  e.g., phishing, new downloads, online shopping  rather than one that focuses on just one potential threat area.</p>

<p>
<em>Example:</em> 
<strong>Norton 360, v5.0</strong> provides a wealth of security functions, including virus scanning, application-performance alerts, new-file analysis and even a social-media scanner that identifies threats on sites like Facebook.</p>

<h2>Office Productivity Suite</h2>

<p>It's possible to cobble together several applications that separately address spreadsheets, word processing, email and other basic business functions. But if all of these applications are in one package, they'll work much better together. Preventing compatibility problems will increase productivity and streamline simple business tasks.</p>

<p>
<em>Example:</em> 
<strong>Microsoft Office Professional 2010</strong> is useful because it bundles many popular business applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote.</p>

<h2>Customer Relationship Management</h2>

<p>Customized marketing campaigns and organized client contacts make customer relationship management (CRM) a powerful part of any business strategy. With CRM, companies can boost sales-team effectiveness and communicate better with customers  both of which can lead to higher revenues and growth.</p>

<p>
<em>Example:</em> 
<strong>Sales and Marketing Pro</strong>, a suite with a robust CRM tool, marketing strategy tips, client organization capability and sales forecasting.</p>

<p>In general, a well-rounded office PC is much like a well-rounded entrepreneur: loaded with varied skills, stocked with plenty of knowledge and limber enough to adapt to the ever-changing business climate.</p>

<title>Let's Take Apart a PC, Shall We?</title>
<description>The ability to work on your computer's internal components can come in handy when installing new components or upgrading your existing system. Following these tips can help  you avoid common pitfalls.</description>

<p>The ability to work on your computer's internal components can come in handy when installing new components or upgrading your existing system. Following these tips can help  you avoid common pitfalls.</p></blockquote>

<p>The scene inside a PC can seem like a mess of cables and space-age components. But once you know the landscape, you'll discover a beautiful simplicity to it all.</p>

<p>A good way to learn about your PC's hardware is to undertake a hard drive replacement (a process that can boost performance and speed). Although it's beneficial and less risky to have a professional handle the procedure, it can be enlightening to know how it's done. Here are the key steps:</p>

<ol start="1">

<li>
<strong>Install new software.</strong>
<em> </em>In many cases, a new hard drive will come with software that needs installation. Many hard drive replacements can be done without this step, but read the hard drive's manual to find out what's recommended.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">

<li>
<strong>Remove the panels from the case.</strong>
<em> </em>First, be sure to ground yourself by wearing an antistatic wristband or keeping one hand on the metal part of the case. Then unscrew the panel (the large metal sheet on the back) on the case. In some instances, this step will require taking off the entire case and setting it aside.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">

<li>
<strong>Pause and take a look at the components and cables.</strong>
<em> </em>When replacing a drive, cables may need to be moved or other components shifted. Understand where everything goes before making any shifts. You might even want to take a digital photo as a reference, so you can double-check your work at the end of the replacement. Especially important is to look at where the current drive is plugged into the motherboard.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">

<li>
<strong>Remove the existing drive and insert the new one.</strong> A hard drive will be in a square or rectangular space called a "cage," although it's really more of a fence around the drive. The drive is screwed into the cage. To replace the drive, unscrew and carefully remove it. Mount the new drive. This process will vary depending on the drive. But in most cases, the drive should slide into the space easily. Secure it with the screws.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">

<li>
<strong>Connect the cables.</strong> You'll need to plug in the data cable and the power cable. This process, too, will vary depending on what kind of drive you have. For a SATA drive, the data cable will plug into the SATA channel that's marked on the motherboard. For an IDE drive, find the IDE channel on the motherboard and connect it there.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">

<li>
<strong>Set the drive jumper. </strong>For IDE drives, drive jumpers must be tweaked. Jumpers are connectors with tiny pins that help to determine how the drive will be used. Consult the drive's manual to verify jumper settings and locations. These are usually printed on the drive itself as well. Using needlenose pliers, move the jumper to the correct designation. If the drive will be your PC's new main drive, the setting you want is "Master," a word that will appear below that portion of the jumper.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="7">

<li>
<strong>Put everything back into place. </strong>Now is a good time to refer to that photo you took and make sure all cables and components are back where they belong. If everything looks right, replace the panel or case, screw it into place and plug in the power supply. Boot up and see if you were successful.</li>
</ol>

<p>Opening up a PC and getting to know the jumble within may seem intimidating at first. By taking a process like hard-drive replacement one step at a time, however, it's much easier to navigate the inner workings.</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="left">Two aggressive computer viruses are threatening PC users everywhere. Learn more about them and what you can do to protect yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Malicious programmers sometimes give their viruses very peculiar names, such as I Love You. It sends an email with the subject line I love you to everyone in your address book  then it graciously wipes out files on your computer.</p>

<p align="left">The irony of a loving, data-deleting virus is not lost on us, nor was it on the faceless, unknown programmer or programmers who first set I Love You onto the computing world. The I Love You virus is actually fairly old by technology standards, so here are two of the most recent and dangerous viruses, and what you can do about them today.</p>

<h2 align="left">The ZeroAccess Rootkit (Trojan.zeroaccess.B) (Virus/Max++) (Dropper.Sirefef.B)</h2>

<p align="left">The ZeroAccess virus, or any of its variants listed in the above heading, is incredibly hard to detect and remove because of its ability to remain very well hidden on your drive  it can even block anti-malware software from working. Once it infects your PC, the virus engages in automated click fraud and can download rogue security software (described next) among other bad things.</p>

<p align="left">ZeroAccess is a member of the Trojan Horse virus family, meaning it comes into your computer under a friendly guise only to create trouble in another form (just as the Greeks entered Troy). After infection, ZeroAccess can communicate with sites to download additional malware to your PC and open software back doors for further mischief. This feature also allows the virus to update itself when security programs figure out ways to defeat it, making it a very persistent, almost intelligent piece of malware.</p>

<p align="left">Typical symptoms of infection include:</p>

<ul>

<li>A serious slowdown of your computers processing abilities</li>

<li>Your search engine results are redirected to unrelated sites</li>

<li>Lots of unwanted pop-up ads appear during your browsing</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="left">Protection from the ZeroAccess Virus</h2>

<p align="left">Antivirus software can identify and remove it in different ways, depending on the variant you have, but its a moving target. ZeroAccess is so clever that even if you reformat your hard drive and reinstall your system it cannot be deleted. If ZeroAccess has taken hold of your PC the best way to remove it is to do a low-level wipeout of your hard drive  this zero filling process writes on every sector of the drive  and then reinitialize the disk.</p>

<h2 align="left">Win 7 AntiVirus (Win 7 Internet Security 2012) (Win 7 Security 2012)</h2>

<p align="left">This virus is disguised as a free antivirus program. Once installed on your computer, the program alerts you to a bunch of serious infections (you really dont have any) and asks you to pay for an upgrade to a more powerful version of the program that will remove the virus</p>

<p align="left">Typical signs of infection include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Multiple, high-level security alerts that you are infected.</li>

<li>Constant scans of your hard drive.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">Ironically, the only virus you have on your computer is the Win 7 Antivirus 2012 program, and major harm will only happen if you pay the fee to upgrade the program. This type of software is sometimes called ransomware and it only gets worse if you pay the ransom  your credit card and personal information are now in the hands of someone who intends to use them for more than virus removal!</p>

<h2 align="left">Protection from Win 7 AntiVirus 2012</h2>

<p align="left">Dont download Win 7 AntiVirus 2012 when asked to do so. If its too late for that, dont delete any files Win 7 AntiVirus 2012 says are infected. Instead, use a genuine antivirus program to remove the fake one.</p>

<h2 align="left">Basic Antivirus Prevention</h2>

<p align="left">Never open unsolicited email, attached documents or any .exe files unless you trust the source.</p>

<p align="left">Be very cautious about downloading and using free programs, particularly antivirus software and arcade games.</p>

<p align="left">Always back up your data and applications to disks or drives other than your internal hard drive, so if the worst-case scenario happens, you can regain your data easily.</p>

<p align="left">Purchase a good antivirus program that is regularly updated to catch the latest viruses, such as Norton or Kaspersky.</p>

<p align="left">Keeping your computer safe from viruses and malware can seem like a full time job, but this comprehensive guide will keep you covered from all angles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Sometimes it feels like keeping your PCs virus-free is like playing a game of Whack-a-Mole. Every day the bad guys are writing more sophisticated code to trash your computer or commit serious financial and emotional damage to you, your family, or your business. Fortunately, the good guys are busy plugging holes, searching for suspects and preventing attacks by improving computer security, but this battle has no end in sight.</p>

<p align="left">Malware refers not just to viruses but to all forms of programming designed to hurt, scam and exploit innocent people. Microsoft provides good, free software to protect Windows from malware. 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/malware-removal.aspx">The Malicious Software Removal Tool</a> does exactly what its title says, and 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/mse.aspx">Windows Security Essentials</a> is an antivirus program for Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7. However, as the bad guys get smarter, you should consider upgrading to a stronger guardian for your personal and business information.</p>

<h2 align="left">How Does a PC Get Infected with a Virus?</h2>

<p align="left">Malware can be transmitted to your computer through a variety of methods, including</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Hacked Web sites:</strong> Legitimate Web sites can be compromised so they pass on infections, steal information or otherwise scam you. Facebook, Twitter and childrens Web sites have all been targeted recently</li>

<li>
<strong>Fake updates:</strong> Manufacturers update their programs regularly, and the bad guys take advantage of this by sending you fake updates that infect your PC when you install them.</li>

<li>
<strong>Video streams:</strong> Netflix and other video-on-demand services use encryption before transmission, so the bad guys cant attach anything to the stream. However, sports sites that broadcast live games are often not encrypted.</li>

<li>
<strong>Virus alerts in a Web browser window: </strong>Dont click on anything when you start seeing these alerts. Quit and restart your browser to avoid getting an infection.</li>

<li>
<strong>Free anything:</strong> Be careful if you receive an offer for free software. Only download software from reputable companies that you know and trust.</li>

<li>
<strong>Advertising:</strong> Things get blurry here, since many kinds of legitimate software track the sites you visit and display ads based on your viewing habits. However, bad guys can use these techniques to steal personal information or bombard you with unwanted advertisements.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="left">Computer Contagion Today</h2>

<p align="left">Malware comes in many forms Trojan Horses, worms, adware, spyware and so on  but viruses are the most well known. Computer viruses have existed since the early 1980s and have evolved into some very dangerous current-day strains, such as ZeroAccess.</p>

<h2 align="left">The ZeroAccess Virus</h2>

<p align="left">This very clever piece of code is known as a rootkit, and its extremely difficult to remove because it disguises itself as a legitimate part of your operating system, such as a device driver. And, if that wasnt devious enough, its defense mechanisms disable antivirus software. ZeroAccess reports to the bad guys about your system activity, and receives updates or additional malware to further infiltrate your system. It also creates a hidden volume on your hard drive. Should you suspect you are infected and reformat your drive, the virus survives in this hidden volume.</p>

<p align="left">Remove ZeroAccess at the first signs of infection:</p>

<ul>

<li>Search-engine results that redirect to irrelevant sites.</li>

<li>Pop-up ads that proliferate when you browse the Web.</li>

<li>An overall decrease in your computers processing speed.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">If you cant remove ZeroAccess with an antivirus program, you may have to perform a low-level wipeout of your hard drive (called zero filling), followed by reinitializing the disk. Staples offers up-to-date antivirus protection and removal services to make this difficult task easier for you.</p>

<h2 align="left">Distributed Denial of Service Attacks</h2>

<p align="left">Zombies are no longer horror fiction  your computer can become one! First, the bad guys infect as many machines as possible without anyone being aware of it. The infection contains code that, when activated by the bad guys, causes all the infected machines to visit a Web site at the same time, flood it with requests and make it crash. Your computer is considered a zombie or bot (short for robot)  a member of a slave army controlled by evildoers. These attacks can be vicious: One took the entire country of Myanmar offline in 2010.</p>

<h2 align="left">Spyware and Keylogging Attacks</h2>

<p align="left">The nastiest malware attacks are the ones that dont send you a signal that something is wrong. Just by visiting an infected Web site, or by clicking Cancel or the X to close a suspicious window, you initiate a sneaky download. It places software on your computer that collects information, including your every keystroke, and sends it to the bad guys. They sift through your data and piece it together to learn, for instance, your passwords, and then exploit the information.</p>

<p align="left">Good antivirus tools can detect and remove hidden programs, but you wont even know you have them unless you perform regular anti-malware scans.</p>

<h2>Social Engineering Attacks</h2>

<p align="left">Scam artists use technology to con you in many ways. For example, they might pretend to be a representative from your financial institution and contact you about a problem with your account. In the course of helping you they solicit personal information such as your PIN or account password. Be suspicious and contact the real company to check if there is a problem with your account  and never click on a link in such an email.</p>

<p align="left">Another common ruse is to trick you into downloading a free antivirus program, such as Win 7 Antivirus 2012. (By the way, this is the name of a genuine piece of malware  beware!) Once the program is installed, it sends constant alerts that your computer is infected and requires you to upgrade to a better program to fix the problem. But the fake antivirus software is generating all the alerts, and when you pay for the upgrade, you are handing the bad guys your credit card and other personal information. This scam is known as rogue security software, ransomware or scareware.</p>

<h2 align="left">Tools for Fighting Malware</h2>

<p align="left">Something is better than nothing when it comes to computer security; if money is an issue, try a free antivirus program, such as AVG Free. Free programs provide some protection, but they are more reactive than proactive  they monitor your system and react when they detect a problem.</p>

<p align="left">A proactive anti-malware program constantly checks links, domains, applications and files against updated databases of new threats and known malware while you work on your PC. These programs are labor-intensive to maintain and offer additional features, so you are asked to pay for them. Two companies that Staples EasyTech recommends are Norton and Kaspersky.</p>

<p align="left">Mobile security for tablets and smartphones is becoming more available. Unsecured mobile devices are greater security risks than viruses for most people; if they get lost or stolen you are giving strangers your personal information.</p>

<h2 align="left">The Annoyance Factor</h2>

<p align="left">Like pop-up ads on the Web, receiving a stream of system alerts from your antivirus software gets tiresome fast. Alert fatigue is a problem because you must pay attention to these windows to prevent computer trouble, and the more sensitive and advanced programs tend give you more warnings as a result.</p>

<p align="left">Overall, system slowdowns and multiple security warnings are no longer common. Norton, an early pioneer in the antivirus world, once had a reputation for hogging system resources, but that is no longer the case. Many programs offer a Gaming Mode that lets antivirus protection run while you play without interruption.</p>

<h2 align="left">Installing Antivirus Protection</h2>

<p align="left">The main thing to know about installing antivirus software is to be certain any previous security software is completely uninstalled, including Windows Essential Security. Once youve done that, all you need to do is load your CD and follow the installation instructions. Check out 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/antivirus-partners/windows-7.aspx">Microsoft's list</a> of security software programs that are compatible with Windows 7.</p>

<h2 align="left">The Future of Malware</h2>

<p align="left">No one knows what the bad guys will create, but these trends seem likely for 2012:</p>

<ul>

<li>Rootkit attacks will get more sophisticated.</li>

<li>Rogue security programs will increase.</li>

<li>Cloud-based services will be targeted by malware.</li>

<li>Cloud-based antivirus programs will become more prevalent, due to their quick response.</li>

<li>Mobile devices will be targeted.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">This picture of the future may seem scary, but there is no need to fear technology if you follow these common-sense suggestions:</p>

<ul>

<li>Install antivirus protection from reputable companies.</li>

<li>Never click a link in an email, install a flash drive, CD or DVD, or download anything from a source you do not know, especially if it is free.</li>

<li>Update your operating system and application software, especially security updates.</li>

<li>Use secure passwords and keep them secret.</li>

<li>Keep your guard up for rogue security software and suspicious computer behavior.</li>

<p align="left">Software that tracks your keystrokes can pose a major security threat to your data, but there are several ways to detect and remove them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">Hey, did you notice that guy standing near the window of the ATM? If you did, you probably put your guard up to make sure that guy couldnt see your PIN or credit card numbers. When you use your computer for online transactions, you may think no one is looking through a window at you, but if you havent secured your computer, there could be someone watching every keystroke you make.</p>

<p align="left">This is known as keylogging
<em>,</em> and though it can be used for good purposes, such as monitoring an employees or childs use of the computer, its more commonly used for the devious purpose of stealing personal information.</p>

<h2 align="left">How Keyloggers Infect Your PC</h2>

<p align="left">Keylogging is accomplished through software or hardware that is secretly added to your computer. For instance, while web browsing you may get a pop-up window claiming your computer is infected with a virus, and to fix it you must download a free program. The best thing to do is close the window or quit your browser without clicking on any buttons, including 
<strong>Cancel</strong>. Any other actions you do can initiate a sneaky download to your computer.</p>

<p align="left">Once the program is running in the background, everything you type is recorded and sent periodically over the Web to evildoers. When they locate a financial or commercial site you joined, they can find your login and payment information and exploit it as they wish. Keyloggers are also hidden in other types of Trojan Horse software, such as free arcade games, infected Web sites and phony updates you receive for legitimate programs that you use.</p>

<h2 align="left">Protection from Software Keyloggers</h2>

<p align="left">The good news is, software keylogger programs typically leave a footprint on your hard drive, so most antivirus software, such as Norton 360, can detect them. If you dont have an antivirus program running (and you really should!), Windows 7 has a way to manually detect and stop keylogging:</p>

<ul>

<li>Right-click on the desktop task bar and choose 
<strong>Start Task Manager</strong>.</li>

<li>Click on the 
<strong>Processes</strong> tab. This is a list of all programs running in the background and foreground of your computer.</li>

<li>Each process has an image name. Go to 
<a href="http://www.liutilities.com/products/wintaskspro/processlibrary/">Liutilities</a> for a list of all Windows 7 processes, and compare your image names to the list.</li>

<li>If you find a process on your PC that is noted as a security risk on Liutilities, click on the process in 
<strong>Task Manager</strong> and click on 
<strong>End Process.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p align="left">This stops the process during the rest of your computer session, but the keylogger will reload when you start your computer again. To remove the keylogger completely, you must install antivirus software, or Staples can do this for you.</p>

<p align="left">If you suspect a keylogger is present but you 
<em>must</em> use your computer, you can use the on-screen keyboard in Windows 7 to type. (Accessed via 
<strong>Start &amp;gt; All Programs &amp;gt; Accessories &amp;gt; Ease of Access &amp;gt; On-Screen Keyboard.</strong>) Keyloggers dont track clicks, but clicking gets tiresome fast!</p>

<h2 align="left">How to Identify a Hardware Keylogger</h2>

<p align="left">Antivirus software cannot detect hardware keyloggers. This is a physical device attached between your computer keyboard and the computer itself.</p>

<p align="left">Once this hardware is plugged into your computer, everything you type is captured and stored in a mini-hard-drive in the device. When evildoers retrieve the device and plug it into their computers, they have everything you typed. Check your connections, and if you see odd hardware between your keyboard and the computer, ask questions.</p>

<p align="left">Use good judgment whenever you go online, and always keep an eye out for that guy standing outside the window.</p>

<title>Technology Exam: How Infected Computers Behave</title>

<blockquote>
<p>If you notice your computer is acting differently, it might be calling in sick.  Learn how to spot a virus-ridden PC and where the bugs may live.</p></blockquote>

<p>Much like somebody who is ill, a computer thats stricken with viruses can exhibit varying symptoms of sickness. The PC can seem slightly off, as if fatigued, or it might try to infect other machines maliciously.</p>

<p>Do you know if your computer needs a checkup or a major antivirus booster? Read on for some symptoms worth noting.</p>

<h2>Sluggish Performance</h2>

<p>The computer seems to be dragging along, taking longer than usual to start up or open programs. While saving changes to documents, it may spin for awhile before completing the task.</p>

<p>This tiredness can seem even worse when new software is installed. The system might restart unexpectedly, or the applications wont work as promised. Or, you start receiving error messages about lack of memory, even though the computer has sufficient RAM.</p>

<p>This type of slowdown is one of the major signs of an infection. Since many viruses run in the background without the user's knowledge, they hog all the available processing power and slow down normal function. Also, by damaging parts of the system, they throw the whole operation into disarray. As a result, it takes longer for your computer to figure out how to function.</p>

<h2>Work Avoidance</h2>

<p>When a virus or other security issue takes hold, it seems like the computer just wants to call in sick. Sometimes, Windows doesnt even start, despite the fact that there havent been any system changes or software installations. Other symptoms: the computer doesnt respond to double-clicking on icons, or certain files get shifted to different folders.</p>

<p>Often, programs that used to run fine will stop responding or prompt error messages. You cant start Windows Task Manager to figure out the problem. A disk utility scan reports multiple errors. Viruses and other infections make applications stop working, disrupt printer functions, or cause system crashes, frequent restarts and other headaches.</p>

<h2>Bad Behavior</h2>

<p>Illness can turn even the sweetest person into a cranky, disgruntled worker. When viruses are present on a computer, that spiteful demeanor can progress to actual sabotage.</p>

<p>The computer may be infected with a keylogger
<em> </em>program, a stealth application that records every keystroke you make. With this information, a hacker would be able to see what Web sites you visit, and also what you input into username and password fields on these sites.</p>

<p>Keyloggers are spyware, a classification of viruses designed to spy on users and report back to the person who launched the attack. These viruses can get on a computer in multiple ways, but the most common method is through pop-up ads that entice users to click on them. When they do, malicious software downloads into the system.</p>

<p>Beware of any ad that asks for a clickthrough. Also, be wary of email attachments with extensions such as .exe or .vbs, since they may contain viruses that will automatically download.</p>

<h2>Spreading the Infection</h2>

<p>When people get sick, they often dont realize they could be infecting others. The same is true when computer viruses strike. Hackers use targeted machines to create a network of zombies that do their work for them.</p>

<p>Unlike the lumbering, flesh-eating creatures in movies, these zombies attack with deliberation and precision. They might send viruses to everyone in your address book, or simply work undetected to keep infection spreading to other computers.</p>

<p>No matter what type of symptoms you see, its important to get your computer healthy again with a strong dose of antivirus protection. Run a security scan that looks for multiple types of threats, and implement the security software's recommendations right away.</p>

<p>As with many other types of sickness, a good dose of care and attention can go a long way when battling an infection in your computer.</p>

<title>Fake Antivirus Applications Are Alive and Well</title>

<blockquote>
<p>The fake antivirus is the most common virus I see on computers. The irony is not missed by anyone. The problem with these tricksters is they can be a pain to remove. Knowledge is the power in this situation so click carefully when using your computer.</p></blockquote>

<p>System error: A virus has been detected. Click here for a removal tool. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>Realistic error messages like this pop up on PCs every day. The goal: get people to click through and buy an antivirus application that doesnt actually work. Or worse, infect a computer with a spyware application that collects personal information about the user and sends it back to the apps creator.</p>

<h2>Tactics of the Bad Guys</h2>

<p>Usually called rogueware or rogue security software, these programs are designed to trick users into paying for simulated removal of security threats. The security scans are very convincing and seem to be doing a good job. The fraudulent company then asks the user for more money to upgrade to a fuller version that can detect even more threats.</p>

<p>In 2010, Google reported that 11,000 domains were hosting fake antivirus software, with about half delivering their rogueware through Internet advertising ploys. Some of the better-known product names include WinFixer, WinAntivirus, DriveCleaner and ErrorSafe.</p>

<p>More recently, hackers have been using search engine optimization techniques to get their Web sites listed at the top of search results. For example, you might Google a recent news event, and a poisoned result will appear at the top of the page. When you click on it to read the article, youll be redirected to a series of sites before landing on a page that claims your machine is infected. The site might offer a free trial security scan.</p>

<p>Once installed, the software might play an animation that simulates a system crash. More commonly, it selectively disables parts of a system to prevent you from uninstalling the software. Some products even thwart antivirus software, disable automatic system software updates, and block access to Web sites of legitimate antivirus firms.</p>

<h2>Defensive Action</h2>

<p>To protect yourself against rogueware, be very wary of any security alerts or warnings that seem unfamiliar or mention a company you don't know. If you see an error message, dont panic. Rogueware creators make their money from the sudden anxiety that strikes users and causes them to quickly remove threats that don't exist.</p>

<p>Dont provide credit card or PayPal information to any company that's associated with these types of alerts. Many times, simply closing the browser window will remove the scary-looking system error alert that's come up.</p>

<p>If you think youve been targeted and that rogueware is already on your system, seek the help of a technology professional. These programs are very difficult to remove on your own, and a pro can wipe out any hidden viruses or other threats.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, fake antivirus applications will live on for a long time, since they make so much money for their creators. But with some awareness and skepticism, your security can stay alive and well, too.</p>

<title>Data Backup: Cloud Computing vs. On-Site Options</title>
<description>Is your data backed up? What are your options? On-site or in the cloud? Take a few minutes now to prevent a lifetime of headaches later!&#13;

<p>Is your data backed up? What are your options? On-site or in the cloud? Take a few minutes now to prevent a lifetime of headaches later!</p></blockquote>

<p>How important is your data? If a hard drive crashed, would you be able to complete your next project? Or review last years payment records? Or even be able to access client contact information? Your business runs on the data stored on your PCs but, chances are, youre not taking adequate steps to protect them.</p>

<p>Youre not alone in this  92% of adult computer users do not do regular backups. However, its just a matter of time before a catastrophic data loss occurs. Luckily, backing up your data is easier than ever. Both on-site and cloud-based options allow you to quickly and easily protect your data and join the ranks of the safe and sound 8%.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Backup Method for You</h2>

<p>On-site backups are hard drives or other backup devices that are directly connected to your computers. Cloud-based backups are servers that connect remotely to your computer through the Internet. Both services provide software that can be set up to back up data manually or automatically. Each type of backup has both advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<h2>On-Site Backup Pros:</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Cost: </strong>Hard drives are inexpensive, so you can purchase plenty of backup space and ensure that you have room to expand without additional costs.</li>

<li>
<strong>Installation: </strong>Hard drives are easy to install, and usually come with software designed to make backing up your data easy and automatic.</li>

<li>
<strong>Speed: </strong>On-site backups are much faster than online storage solutions. This method is ideal for archiving large amounts of data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>On-Site Backup Cons:</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Security: </strong>A hard drive can easily be stolen. If there is financial or other sensitive data on it that is not encrypted, this can cause significant problems.</li>

<li>
<strong>Damage: </strong>Because its in the same location as you or your office, should you or your office suffer a natural disaster all of your data may become irretrievable.</li>

<li>
<strong>Virus protection: </strong>If you have an undetected virus on your computer, it will probably get backed up to the hard drive, thereby keeping it alive for as long as your backup is around.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cloud-Based Backup Pros:</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Backups of backups: </strong>Your data is always stored off-site and is redundantly copied to other servers in different locations. If one goes down, your data can be retrieved from elsewhere on the backup network.</li>

<li>
<strong>Security: </strong>Data is encrypted by the backup services software program on your computer before it is sent to the cloud, so thieves on the Internet cant intercept it.</li>

<li>
<strong>Virus protection: </strong>The backup service software detects any virus or infection before data is sent. If a virus is found, that file is flagged and not copied to the backup service. You will be notified that the corrupted file has not been deleted from your computer, so you wont lose any data, but it wont be backed up online.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cloud-Based Backup Cons:</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Cost: </strong>Online backups are more expensive, often requiring monthly or annual fees based on the amount of data stored on the servers.</li>

<li>
<strong>Capacity: </strong>Cloud-based backups are best for sensitive information but not for large backups, such as movies, photos and music files. Since some Internet providers limit the amount of data you can send and receive in a month, you must be careful to avoid large backups that cause you to exceed their limits.</li>

<li>
<strong>Speed: </strong>It can take a long time to back up large files online, even with a broadband connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also do a combination: back up all your data to a hard drive, and use a cloud service as a redundant backup for your most important work. As part of its all-purpose computer-maintenance program, the Norton 360 program includes 2 gigs of online backup to get you started with cloud-based backups.</p>

<p>Whatever backup method you choose, the important thing is to make that choice and begin backing up your data.</p>

<p>Cloud computing has challenges as well as benefits. Get informed with the following tips.</p></blockquote>

<p>Accessing media through the cloud is only as fast as your data connection. If you want to watch high-def movies or media, its wise to keep a copy on your own computer as well.</p>

<p>Cloud computing can occasionally be unreliable. Recent outages by Google and BlackBerry have made headlines and reminded users that relying too heavily on the cloud can be dangerous.</p>

<p>Not all cloud storage services are created equal. Read the fine print for any storage or sharing site to ensure you have some guarantees about your datas safety.</p>

<title>Your Head in the Clouds: First Flight Into Cloud Computing</title>

<p>Buckle up, we're headed into the cloud! Cloud services, to be precise. It's the future of data backup and recovery, and we want you along for the ride.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your desktop is no longer the center of the computing universe. Many tasks you used to perform in house are now being outsourced to more powerful computers elsewhere.</p>

<p>That YouTube video you just watched? Never once saved to your PC. Those honeymoon pictures you cherish on Facebook? Currently being stored somewhere far away. Even the personal email you just wrote on Gmail was almost certainly formatted, spell-checked, sent and saved from within an anonymous computing bunker in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>Tasks we offload onto someone elses computers are part of the cloud. Cloud computing involves data that is not tethered to any one point or PC. Music saved to the cloud can be accessed from any device, anywhere. Documents saved to the cloud can be opened by anyone with a password. And complex tasks that might otherwise tax your home PC can be addressed in a flash through the computing might of a big company.</p>

<p>Cloud computing is becoming so popular, in fact, that some experts believe the home PC will soon be little more than a terminal we use to access these Web-based services. What follows is a brief tour of the best of these services: a walk in the cloud.</p>

<h2>Cloud Cover</h2>

<p>The most popular way to use the cloud is for simple storage. Modern PCs hold a lot of data, but too many movies and media files can push any hard drive to its limit. Online services such as Xdrive and Dropbox give users a better way to save the things they care about. Just upload your documents to one of these services, and youll never worry about running out of storage space again.</p>

<h2>Puffy Productivity</h2>

<p>The cloud offers more than mere storage. Its also 
<em>useful</em>  you can access and run full applications on the cloud without ever opening an app on your home desktop. Google Docs, for instance, is a popular suite of applications that runs completely within your Web browser. Cloud-based software lets you do many of the things you already do  edit documents, build spreadsheets, touch up photographs  without burdening your own computer.</p>

<h2>Sharing in the Cloud</h2>

<p>The cloud is where all social media lives. Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube and many more social sites store everything in the cloud, so you can quickly share the things you love. Cloud computing lets grandparents admire their latest additions from across the globe and friends check out those party pics seconds after you snap them.</p>

<p>Think of cloud computing as regular computing set free. When your favorite docs, tasks and media can be edited and accessed from anywhere, it becomes far easier to untether from your desk and live life on-the-go. Try a few of the most popular online services and you'll agree: The future's so bright, it's cloudy.</p>

Something just doesnt feel right. Theres a reason for this, and it is important to ensure the symptoms are not indicative of a bigger problem. This article has great advice to help friends identify the warning signs and take action.</p></blockquote>

<p>Is your PC getting old and sluggish? Dont send it into retirement yet. Like a whale encrusted with barnacles, PCs sometimes slow down because theyre loaded with unwelcome passengers in the form of malicious software (malware) like viruses and spyware.</p>

<p>You probably know not to open file attachments in suspicious emails. But these days, thats not enough to avoid malware. Innocent-looking Web sites can be stealth delivery systems that allow malicious code to do damage.</p>

<p>A simple search on Google may lead you to a dangerous Web site. There, you might download music, videos or software files that are infected with malware  sometimes this can even happen without the site owners knowledge.</p>

<p>How can you tell if youve been on a bad-news Web site? Look out for the symptoms below. If you notice any of these symptoms, perform a full virus scan right away, either with trusted tools from software vendors like Norton, or our own Staples EasyTech diagnostic and antivirus services.</p>

<h2>Running Like a Sloth</h2>

<p>Is your PC starting up slowly or running slowly after startup? There are many possible culprits, but you can fight back. Start by defragmenting your hard drive. This can be achieved with the tools included with your Windows operating system (for example, here are the instructions for 
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314848">defragmenting Windows XP</a>) or by way of a professional in-store service consultation. Also, confirm that your computer has enough memory (RAM) to run your applications. Sometimes this check is as simple as consulting the side of the software box youre using, or visiting that companys Web site (since many applications are downloaded online these days, and not picked up in a store). Then you can watch 
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Find-out-how-much-RAM-your-computer-has">this official Microsoft Windows video</a> to learn how to determine exactly how much RAM your PC currently uses. If neither step solves the problem, you may have a virus or other malware.</p>

<h2>Programs or Parts of Programs Not Working</h2>

<p>Are you unable to open certain programs? Are some program features not working? Does your computer crash when you try to open specific programs or files? These may all be signs that a virus is doing its dirty work. Its important to keep track of which files or programs aren't working correctly. After youve determined the source of the problem, you may need to restore the files or reinstall the programs.</p>

<h2>Masters of Disguise</h2>

<p>Viruses have many dirty tricks, but disguising themselves as antivirus software is one of the worst. So be sure to know which antivirus software is on your PC. Note what it looks like when it's running and whether it ever launches pop-ups. And if you ever see pop-up ads claiming you have a virus and telling you to click here? Don't do it. Click 
<strong>Control+Alt+Delete</strong> on your keyboard and then 
<strong>End Task.</strong> .This will safely and quickly kill the offending pop-up.</p>

<h2>Change Isn't Always a Good Thing</h2>

<p>Is your browser starting at a new home page when you open it? Does it have a new toolbar that you didn't install? Is there a new bookmark in your Favorites list that you dont remember adding? If these things happen without your knowledge, you may have an invader. Check your operating system with 
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/windows-update">Microsofts official Update tool</a> and make sure it has all the latest updates installed; these updates often contain patches for security loopholes that hackers have found and exploited.</p>

<h2>Other Odd Behavior</h2>

<p>Is your browser opening up by itself? Is your screen changing colors? Are files missing? Try restarting your PC when you observe unexpected actions like these. If the trend continues, you may need a virus cleanup.</p>

<h2>Emails You Didnt Send</h2>

<p>If your PC is infected, you might just find out via email. That is, some malware allows hackers to send copies of the virus or requests for money, in your name, to your email contacts. If you learn your contacts are getting these messages, change the password for your email program right away.</p>

<p>It's hard to tell safe Web sites from dangerous ones, so the best strategy for safe browsing is to keep your PC defended. Make sure youre using quality antivirus software that updates regularly and scans your PC often. And always keep an eye out for all of the above symptoms so that you can run a thorough virus scan in a timely manner. You may also need spyware protection, either separately or as part of your anti-virus software.</p>

<p>This all may sound like a lot of work, but remember: its easier to protect yourself from a virus infection than to recover from one.</p>

<p>Installing antivirus software on your PC isn't up for debate, but before you go installing that new application, make sure it's the real deal.</p></blockquote>

<p>When it comes to computer security, are you locking all the windows but leaving the front door wide open?</p>

<p>Installing antivirus software  a critical part of protecting your system and data  can get tricky at certain points. Installation oversights and mistakes can leave your PC more vulnerable to attack than before you started. Here are a few things you should avoid to stay safe.</p>

<h2>Skimming Over the Compatibility Requirements</h2>

<p>Antivirus applications require a minimum processing speed to run efficiently. They also need a specific amount of RAM and hard-drive space. If you lack the necessary RAM, you might be able to install and run the program  but the software could freeze your computer when it looks for the resources it needs and can't find them.</p>

<h2>Ignoring Competing Antivirus Applications</h2>

<p>Some PCs already have antivirus software installed as part of a package, or have a trial version that came with the system. Sometimes, these applications start up automatically  usually without the users knowledge  and an attempt to install another antivirus application can cause incompatibility.</p>

<p>Review your programs to see if any antivirus software is already present. If so, you may need to do an un-install to remove it. Software removal tools are available that can help clean these programs off your machine. But be sure that any tool you use is from a reputable company. You dont want hackers helping you to remove protection from your PC.</p>

<h2>Not Booting into Safe Mode First</h2>

<p>If your computer is already infected, it may be running a virus that interferes with the installation of antivirus software. Booting into Safe Mode may allow you to install the program more easily or at least do a virus scan. Safe Mode bootup starts the computer with a limited set of files and drivers and without start-up programs (a common place for viruses to hide).</p>

<p>To use Safe Mode in Windows 7, press and hold the 
<strong>F8</strong> key as your computer restarts. A window will come up: 
<strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong>. Use the arrow keys to highlight 
<strong>Safe Mode</strong> option, and press 
<strong>Enter</strong>. Log on to your computer with your administrator password and attempt to install the software. When finished, restart the computer normally.</p>

<h2>Skipping an Online Scan</h2>

<p>If antivirus software cant install in Safe Mode, its possible to try to remove the virus manually so that installation can be done later. For this tactic, try an online virus scanner from a reputable firm like Kaspersky.</p>

<p>An online virus scanner can quickly identify a range of viruses, worms, Trojan Horses and spyware. They can also determine if any threats within the Windows system might be thwarting installation. If security threats do exist, the online scanners will recommend tactics for removal.</p>

<h2>Not Making Sure of the Internet Connection</h2>

<p>In order to get the most recent updates to a security package, antivirus software needs an Internet connection. Its possible to install the software without a connection, but your protection will be limited until the application can take full advantage of updates.</p>

<p>By avoiding these oversights, youll help your antivirus software do its job properly. Not only will you lock the windows 
<em>and</em> doors, but youll also 
<em>keep</em> them locked.</p>

<blockquote>

<p align="left">This is it. All you need to know about data backup and recovery, all neat and tidy in one place. Read on to become a master of data protection and recovery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">What do you do when your computer crashes?</p>

<ol>

<li>Hit the computer and scream at it.</li>

<li>Stare blankly while contemplating your lost data.</li>

<li>Calmly restore your data from your most recent backup.</li>
</ol>

<p align="left">Most users usually choose A and B before they decide to embrace C. Well cut straight to C and learn how finding, installing and managing the latest backup drives and technologies is easy.</p>

<h2 align="left">Identify Your Backup Needs</h2>

<p align="left">How you use your computer will determine what backup system works best for you. If youre only backing up a few Microsoft Office documents every day, a basic backup drive without too much memory will probably suffice. But if you work with video files, youll need a fast, high-capacity backup drive, as six minutes of uncompressed high-definition video requires about 1GB of space on your drive. In general, the more digital equipment you own and use, the more hard drive space you need for working and backups.</p>

<p align="left">Take a look at your computer and note what ports are available for plugging in a backup device. If space and ports are at a premium for you, Staples can install a second internal hard drive in most desktop enclosures (they usually have room for an additional drive) to serve as your backup.</p>

<h2 align="left">Match Your Backup Drive to Your Computer System</h2>

<p align="left">The kind of backup thats right for you will depend on the type of PC and how you use it:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Laptops/Notebooks:</strong> A portable backup drive is best for mobile computing, since Web access for online backups is not always available when you need it. A flash drive or memory card can work for small-file backups, but a portable hard drive powered through the USB port of your laptop can handle a complete data backup.</li>

<li>
<strong>Stand-alone Desktops:</strong> An external drive with an AC adapter provides the most storage space for your dollar.</li>

<li>
<strong>Network-Attached Computers:</strong> To back up different computers on a network, special external hard drives can be attached to your homes or businesss wireless router to back up everything on the network.</li>

<li>
<strong>Business Computers:</strong> RAID- and cloud-based backups
<strong> </strong>(see below)
<strong> </strong>provide options that are redundant and secure, but they are also expensive. Staples Thrive Networks provide cloud backups as well as other information technology (IT) services for small, medium and large businesses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="left">Backup Drive Sizes</h2>

<p align="left">It is widely recommended that your backup drive be twice as large as your computers drive, so youll have room to archive old files and be able to back up current ones. Megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB) are measurements for how much data a drive can store; be sure to match GB to GB and so on when you calculate how much drive space you need.</p>

<p align="left">Expect to pay between $100 (for 500GB drives) to $250 (for a 3TB drive). Most drives come with backup software and some drives include encryption software. Encryption is particularly valuable for businesses and professionals who keep copies of their backups off-site, as well as a safety mechanism if the hard drive gets stolen.</p>

<h2 align="left">Backup Options</h2>

<p align="left">From flash drives that fit on your keychain to storing your data in the cloud, you have a variety of choices when it comes to where you back up your data:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>CDs and DVDs.</strong> If your computer has a CD/DVD burner, you can back up your data using software already in your system or with third-party software. Since a CD holds 700MB of data, a single-layer DVD holds 4.7GB and a double-layer DVD holds 8.5GB, you must back up large files on many disks. The ongoing cost of disks quickly adds up, so this is not a permanent backup solution, but it is useful as a one-time backup for a valuable file.</li>

<li>
<strong>USB (Universal Serial Bus).</strong> USB 2 drives have slow data-transfer rates, so they arent good choices for people who watch or edit video or play large computer games  youll notice dropped frames and pauses. Until recently, the majority of drives used USB 2 connections. USB 3 is now entering the market and its ten times faster than USB 2. Its backwards compatible with USB 2 ports, and USB 2 devices will work in USB 3 ports.</li>

<li>
<strong>Firewire.</strong> Firewire is used for digital media editing; many camcorders and digital cameras have Firewire connections. Firewire drives are easily cabled together to create redundant backups.</li>

<li>
<strong>eSATA (external Serial Advanced Technological Attachment).</strong> These have the fastest transfer rates of any external hard drive, but they require a special interface or a card that is not compatible with many computers. However, any computer can usually accept an internal SATA drive without difficulty.</li>

<li>
<strong>RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Discs). </strong>RAID is often used in business settings because of its backup and uptime capabilities. A simple RAID setup is two drives running simultaneously, with one mirroring everything that is on the other. So if one drive stops working, the other will keep the system going without a glitch. However, hardware RAID controllers and drives can be expensive.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">Windows 7 Professional and above can control multiple hard drives using a software RAID setup, but they must be identical drives for optimal performance. Devices are available that can configure mismatched hard drives (for instance, a 500GB and a 2TB) into a RAID.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Cloud-Based Backups.</strong> You can store your data using a cloud-based (online) service.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="left"> Backup Strategies</h2>

<p align="left">The best plan is to back up everything you use every day. Hard drive capacities have increased and prices have dropped to the point that this is possible. You may think you only need to back up key documents because you can reinstall your system and applications from their disks, but have you considered how long and tiresome that process will be? With everything backed up to an external hard drive, youll be back to work much quicker.</p>

<p align="left">The software included with most external hard drives provides scheduling and auto-backup tools. Windows 7 contains backup software that is very good  and it also supports network-attached computers.</p>

<h2 align="left">Redundancy is the Key to Backup Success</h2>

<p align="left">Hard drives die when you least expect them to  especially your backup drive! This is why it is important to make multiple backups of important files, photos, music and videos you cant afford to lose and keep a copy off-premises. Try to mix your media to ensure your data can be recovered easily.</p>

<ul>

<li>Make a copy of your data, including a bootable system, on a 
<em>second</em> backup drive and keep it off-site. Alternate this drive with your first backup drive on a regular schedule. Should your local drive and your backup bite the dust, youll quickly be up and running with your second backup.</li>

<li>Use a flash drive to back up critical files on an hourly basis while you work. If a scheduled backup didnt happen before your computer drive dies, youll only lose an hour of work. Flash drives are small and easy to lose, so they shouldnt be used as a permanent archive.</li>

<li>CDs and DVDs can be used for additional backups of valuable files.</li>

<li>Online backups can be used like a flash drive to store important projects as you work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="left">Online Versus Physical Backups</h2>

<p align="left">Online backup services provide you with space to store your data in the cloud, meaning over the Internet into their servers. The main benefits of online backups are that your data is automatically stored off-site and copied to many servers, and it is automatically encrypted and checked for viruses before it is sent to the cloud.</p>

<p align="left">The costs of online backups can add up because fees are ongoing and are based on how much data you store. Furthermore, if you back up lots of data, you may exceed the monthly limits of your Internet provider, incurring additional fees.</p>

<p align="left">Physical backups have certain advantages over cloud services, such as the falling cost of large-capacity hard drives and ease of installation. However, hard drives can be stolen; if an accident occurs in your home or office, you can lose all the data on your computer 
<em>and</em> your backup (if you dont keep a backup copy offsite)  and viruses that accidentally get backed up will reinfect your PC when you restore files.</p>

<h2 align="left">Backups: The More the Merrier</h2>

<p align="left">Having multiple copies of your most important data makes sense, but you shouldnt stop there. Also create copies of all your passwords, serial numbers and activation codes for any software you may need to reinstall, as well as information needed to reconnect your restored computer to your home network and the Internet.</p>

<p align="left">If you have lots of passwords to keep track of, free programs are available that help you manage and encrypt all your passwords in one easy-to-use application.</p>

<p align="left">Now its time for the post-test: What do you do after you establish a working backup system?</p>

<ol>

<li>Relax.</li>

<li>Never stop using it.</li>

<li>All of the above.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>To the castle walls! OK, so that was a bit dramatic. PC security isn't as glamorous as a Hollywood war movie, but it's undeniably more important to you and your business. These tips can help keep things secure.</p></blockquote>

<p>So you have a new office PC. Are you ready to defend it?</p>

<p>One of the most important steps in setting up a computer is creating a bulletproof security defense. This initial protection will not only keep documents and data safe, but also ensure that your PC performs well and stays speedy.</p>

<p>To make sure youre putting the strongest protections in place, follow these steps:</p>

<h2>Step 1: Turn on the Firewall</h2>

<p>Much like the name implies, a firewall is a barrier between your computer and the outside world. It helps to block viruses and other security risks. To turn on the firewall in Windows 7, click the 
<strong>Start</strong> button and then 
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type firewall and then click on 
<strong>Windows Firewall</strong>. On the left-hand side of the pane, there will be an option to turn the firewall on or off. Type your administrator password when prompted, click 
<strong>Turn on Windows Firewall</strong> under each network location and then click OK.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Set Automatic Updates in Windows</h2>

<p>Hackers are constantly tweaking their attacks and programs, so you must continually be in defensive mode. Automatic Updates allows you to get the latest security protections. To turn these on in Windows 7 and Windows Vista, click 
<strong>Start</strong> and type Windows update in the search box. Click on 
<strong>Windows Update</strong> when it appears in the Programs list. In the pane, click 
<strong>Change Settings</strong>. Youll have several options, but a popular choice is 
<strong>Recommended Updates</strong>. After you choose your option, click OK.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Install Microsoft Security Essentials</h2>

<p>This program is a free download from Microsoft that enables you to combat viruses, spyware and other threats. It runs automatically in the background, making updates to your security settings. Visit 
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials">this page</a> to download and install the Security Essentials protection.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Install Security Software</h2>

<p>Having additional security software beyond Microsofts protections adds another layer or two of defense. Numerous security products are available, so do some homework on which one seems best suited to your needs and budget. Choose a reputable company thats backed by tech support and offers updates to its program. Once youve chosen, you can download the software either from a disk or from the companys Web site. After the download, open the setup program and follow the instructions. Most, if not all, security applications offer easy setup that guides you through the process.</p>

<p>Although its tempting to fire up a new PC and get on the Internet right away, its a smart idea to set up your security first. Ensuring the computer is properly defended now, when youre just setting it up, will save you from having to scramble later if any viruses manage to attack.</p>

<p>Don't forget to back up your data! No, really, this is one of the most important pieces of advice we can offer. Still need help? Start with this handy guide.</p></blockquote>

<p>Youve heard it dozens of times: Dont forget to back up your data. We admit, we tend to say it often ourselves, and for good reason. Backing up can prevent data loss in the event of hard drive failure or computer theft  and give you a little extra peace of mind. Its also easier than you might think.</p>

<p>Here are some top backup options for keeping your data safe.</p>

<h2>External Hard Drives</h2>

<p>Usually looking sleek and futuristic, external drives offer high-capacity storage and often feature automatic backup options. That means youre freed from backup tasks after initial setup, unless you want to change the settings. External drives can usually be positioned either vertically or horizontally so that they fit nicely into any desktop space.</p>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> A 
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;ved=0CJYBEBYwAQ&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seagate.com%2Fexternal-hard-drives%2Fportable-hard-drives%2Fstandard%2Fgoflex%2F&amp;amp;ei=qnMFUP-sIIf20gHXu-3tCA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEnSKVAcUT9kNVMNbRNNSV7Xnze8Q&amp;amp;sig2=TxUGrfAkJyLlr6ylBGsY5w">Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex</a> external hard drive comes with encryption technology to keep files safe, and allows for backup from a PC or Mac.</p>

<h2>USB Flash Drives</h2>

<p>Generally used for transporting small to moderate amounts of data, USB flash drives are perfect for transferring photos, videos and other files between computers. Theyre small  one can fit in the palm of your hand or on your key ring  and affordable. USB flash drives are a convenient option for storing photos from a vacation, or all the files involved in a certain work project.</p>

<p>
<strong>Example: </strong>A
<strong> </strong>
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CGYQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sandisk.com%2Fproducts%2Fusb-flash-drives%2Fcruzer-usb-flash-drive&amp;amp;ei=y3MFUKKUCOHb0QHAnbTbCA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHUGssYYBu2pwAm92KRe6NQTF4qvg&amp;amp;sig2=wyqnN8I911Ynik2oC9mjKQ">SanDisk Cruzer</a> USB flash drive comes in different capacities, from 4GB to 64GB, and includes secure software that keeps files protected.</p>

<h2>Network Attached Storage</h2>

<p>For small companies or homes with multiple computers, network attached storage (NAS) is a good option because it can centralize storage functions. Rather than getting external drives for each computer, everyone can back up to the same location, which also facilitates document and printer sharing. These storage options are often packed with other advantages as well, such as simple uploading and plug-and-play setup.</p>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong>
<em> </em>
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CJIBEBYwAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwdc.com%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fproducts.aspx%3Fid%3D280&amp;amp;ei=4XMFUOHPFMPe0QGcgNHvCA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGiw9MIZqTE5IgrLrtln_1YzSaiWw&amp;amp;sig2=iQNaUtC2Ls-RB8rRhlTggw">Western Digital My Book Live</a> creates a single location for everyone on your network to store files, including music, movies and photos. The device also lets you stream media to your entertainment center and access your files over the Internet from anywhere.</p>

<h2>Online Backup Services</h2>

<p>Several reputable, affordable online services let you put your data into their cloud. The advantage of this type of backup is that you can access data from any computer, anywhere theres an Internet connection. Prices are based on how much storage you need, and can rise quickly. But for those who travel a great deal or just want the assurance of additional backup, online storage is a compelling option.</p>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> 
<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CHIQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fsbd%2Fcre%2Fmarketing%2Fcarbonite-online-backup%2Findex.html&amp;amp;ei=9HMFUIL4HqqB0QHw4cCgCA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEGe1NNPB1ba3lGScVBnAs9niZFdQ&amp;amp;sig2=pPspHKbBzHoGU7f1NKbqqQ">Carbonite</a> offers a free trial for its service and has plans available for both home users and small business users. The company also provides tutorials on file backup and data recovery.</p>

<p>Staples offers Carbonite backup products in our stores and online at Staples.com as well. With our help, we can set up Carbonite products for your home office or small business.</p>

<p>Once you choose a backup option and your data is safe, then you can move on to other activities  like reminding everyone else to back up their data, too.</p>

<p>Your data disappeared. Deleted. Zapped. Mysteriously vanished. Whatever the case may be, you know you need help. Start here. Entry-level data protection advice, direct from our experts.</p></blockquote>

<p>You are at your PC finalizing a report and open a program. Your screen freezes, then flickers and dies. You lose the rest of the day trying in vain to find a fix. Then you spend the night tossing and turning as you mull over how much youve just lost. Files, contacts, family photos, research, financial data, passwords and so on.</p>

<p>Dont be that guy (or gal). Data backup is about creating and preserving a copy of your PCs content to guard against a virus, crash or other disaster. In other words, making sure the stuff that matters most on your PC is always secure and accessible.</p>

<h2>Storage: Where Backup Files Live</h2>

<p>Backup devices  the hardware that stores the actual data  take many forms, including:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Online backup services: </strong>Storing your backup files with an online service is a simple and increasingly popular option  especially if you travel a lot and dont have a ton of data to back up. Most services allow you to store a limited amount of data at little or no cost; fees increase with the amount of storage you require.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>External hard drives: </strong>Todays external hard drives feature automatic backup and lots of storage. If you travel often, you can easily find portable devices that hold 60GB+.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Network attached storage (NAS): </strong>If you have multiple computers, at home or at work, NAS lets you back them all up to a single location. NAS also allows for network sharing of files and printers.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>USB flash drives: </strong>Small and portable, USB flash drives are great for backing up files on the road. However, most dont have the storage capacity to serve as your only backup system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Software: How Backups Happen</h2>

<p>The system you rely on for backups needs to support the degree and frequency of backups you need.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>One-click system backup </strong>lets you back up everything with a single click.</li>

<li>
<strong>Files-in-use backup </strong>lets you perform data backups while your computers still working.</li>

<li>
<strong>Complete system backup </strong>saves a copy of your hard drive, allowing you to restore your entire computer back to a given point in time.</li>

<li>
<strong>Incremental or </strong>
<strong>differential backups</strong> may be used in conjunction with complete system backups to limit the data  and time  involved with a backup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other features to consider in backup software include data compression to maximize storage space, filtering to identify certain files for backup and password encryption to protect against hacking. And make sure you understand how  and how quickly  youll recover files and programs after a loss.</p>

<p>Once youve found a backup system that suits you, be sure to use it and use it right. Test it every so often to be sure its working. And then look forward to a good nights sleep.</p>

<title>From A to B: Data Transfer 123</title>

<p>Everything you need to know to move all your files from one computer to another--so you don't lose precious photos, Grandma's best recipes, favorite jams and all the other important items you keep on your PC.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, getting a file from one machine to another can seem as easy as using carrier pigeons to pay your bills. Sure, the necessary documents might arrive on time and on target, but is it really worth the hassle?</p>

<p>Our answer: For bills, no. But for data, absolutely. (And no pigeons are involved.)</p>

<p>Knowing how to do data transfer allows you to back up important files (from photos and music to work documents) so that you have copies in case of computer failure or theft. The two main choices for data transfer are external drives and online backup. Each has pros and cons.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>External Drives</strong> (e.g., small flash drives and larger hard disk drives)
<strong>:</strong> Advantages include a large amount of storage space, affordability, portability and quick access to data. But they can also get lost or stolen, be affected by high humidity or flooding, and sometimes need software updates.</li>

<li>
<strong>Online Backup: </strong>Advantages include no risk of theft of a physical device, working in the background to save new documents as theyre created, tech support availability and access to data from anywhere you have an Internet connection. Disadvantages include the inability to access data if your Internet connection is down and higher pricing for some services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Think about whats most important to you, in terms of access. Do you need data in a format where you can slip it in your pocket via a flash drive, or is it better to be able to get your data from any computer, anywhere in the world?</p>

<h2>Preparing Files for Transfer</h2>

<p>When getting files ready, take a look at what you really need to save. Not every document is a keeper, and cleaning out your files will reduce the amount of time and effort spent in backup.</p>

<p>Also, for some online services, you can create an automatic backup system that pulls documents from only one folder on your hard drive. So, you may want to create a folder called current work or save to make it easier to know whats getting backed up.</p>

<h2>Making the Transfer</h2>

<p>Fortunately, when it comes to data transfer, technology is our friend. Online services and most external devices have setup functions that are easy to navigate. Just follow the steps they provide for saving files, and you should be good.</p>

<p>For external drives that dont have clear instructions, you can usually click on a document and slide it to the device icon, similar to physically putting a piece of paper in a drawer.</p>

<h2>Checking Your Work</h2>

<p>Once youve transferred your files, its important to make sure theyre stored properly. So take a minute to run a fire drill recovery. For example, pretend your favorite photos were destroyed on your hard drive and attempt to retrieve them from your service or external drive. If they come through fine, you know your strategy is working.</p>

<p>Data transfer and backup are often put off, and many people regard them as just another chore on a long to-do list. But making backup a priority will prevent loss in the future  and give you welcome peace of mind.</p>

The thing is, people dont always have their data backed up, or the backup is not current (I have been in this situation myself). The great news is there are some things you can do to increase the chances of data recovery.</p></blockquote>

<p>Its a stomach-dropping, adrenaline-producing moment: The computer screen goes dark, or an unfamiliar error message pops up announcing hard drive failure.</p>

<p>The outcome of these dramatic moments can be catastrophic or minor, and sometimes, its what you do during the crisis that can make the difference. Here are some valuable dos and donts:</p>

<p>
<strong>Actions to Take</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Determine whats causing the problem: a hard drive crash (also known as a physical failure) or a software issue (or, logical failure). Suppose the computer does an automatic reboot and you hear a grinding, whirring or clicking noise that sounds as if the computer is working much harder than it usually does. That probably indicates a hard drive failure, and you should consult a professional. If the drive sounds fine, most likely its a software problem.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>If the computer sounds fine and doesnt go through a reboot, then think about any recent changes to the peripherals, hardware configuration or software mix. Sometimes, compatibility issues crop up unexpectedly and create problems that can seem worse than they really are. It may be necessary to call tech support or a service professional for whatever new hardware or software you recently added.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Make sure it's not malware (i.e., software meant to harm users, installed covertly through accidental downloads). One recently discovered type of malware issues a system error alert telling users that a hard drive is about to fail. It offers a recovery tool thats actually a scam program that moves a users files into another location to create the illusion it's fixing the problem. Be cautious about any alert messages that lead to sites asking for money for recovery programs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Actions to Avoid</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>If those grinding and clicking noises are present on reboot, then stop trying to boot the computer. Also, dont reload the operating system. Unless you build hard drives for a living, your best move is to power down the computer and contact a professional data-recovery service such as 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/">Staples Tech Services</a>. They can guide you through the process of removing the hard drive or bringing the entire machine in for repair.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>If the issue isnt a major drive failure but instead the accidental deletion of a file, don't restart the computer, since the system may create temporary files that overwrite the original data. Instead, try using a data recovery program. Many options are available online and allow you to restore files, even if theyre deleted or corrupted. You can use this strategy with any type of suspected software issue.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Dont lose hope. Just because the computer might sound like its chewing on metal and eating up your data doesnt mean everythings gone. Data recovery is a very common strategy, and data thats seemingly lost often turns out to be fine.</li>
</ul>

<p>And remember: 
<em>Be sure to back up your data now</em>, well before any failure issues arise. That way, if disaster does strike, at least you know your data (and sanity) are safe.</p>

<title>Expert PC Speed &amp; Performance Enhancement Tips</title>

<p>Want a computer update, but not ready to shell out for a brand new computer?  Don't worry, there are other options to fulfill your PC's need for speed.</p></blockquote>

<p>Part of the allure of getting a new computer is the promise of more speed. Just think of it: files opening quickly and Internet browser windows loading faster than ever. But it's possible to get some of that zip while squeezing more mileage out of your current computer.</p>

<p>There are two basic options for souping up a PC: installing new hardware and/or new software. Here's a look at the advantages of each.</p>

<h2>Getting Speedy with Hardware</h2>

<p>Boosting performance through hardware enhancements is a quick way to increase speed. Options include adding random access memory (RAM) chips or a solid-state drive.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>RAM</strong> is similar to a physical workspace  when there's too much clutter, it can be difficult to work efficiently. Expanding the amount of space gives the computer more room to organize all your files and access them quickly. Also, some applications and games take up a chunk of RAM to operate, so having more RAM can make those programs faster in addition to increasing general computing speed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Usually, RAM is very affordable and can be easy to install, depending on your PC and its system. You can check current RAM usage by opening 
<strong>Windows Task Manager</strong>. Press 
<strong>Ctrl-Alt-Del</strong> and click the Performance tab. If the number next to "Available" under "Physical Memory" is close to zero, that means your PC could benefit from more RAM.</p>

<ul>

<li>Another option is using a solid-state drive (SSD). These drives use flash memory to operate, so there's less chance of failure than with a standard hard drive. Flash memory also brings significant speed enhancements and less power use. Plus, true to their name, SSDs have microchips instead of moving parts. This "solid state" means they're less susceptible to breakdown or other problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hardware tends to be more effective for increasing speed on a PC, but it can also be more expensive. Many people opt to try the software route first and then go with hardware for an extra boost of speed.</p>

<h2>Software Tune-Up</h2>

<p>
<strong></strong>Enhancing PC speed with software can be done through multiple tactics. You might do a "spring cleaning" to make things run more smoothly, removing large files like videos and photos that you no longer want.</p>

<p>As part of the cleaning, you can also remove software you no longer use or that seems to be hogging processing power. Not all software can just be trashed, though. Sometimes, you'll have to use an uninstaller program to de-gunk your applications.</p>

<p>Another software speed-up tip is to do deep virus and spyware cleaning. You can employ the 
<strong>Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool</strong> to eliminate infection or use security software that's already monitoring your system.</p>

<p>Disk fragmentation can slow overall performance, too. This happens when files "fragment" on the hard drive and the computer has to search for each piece to open the file. Using the 
<strong>Disk Defragmenter</strong> application consolidates these pieces so that start-up and operations are much faster. You can typically find it under 
<strong>All Programs &amp;gt; Accessories &amp;gt; System Tools</strong>.</p>

<p>Whichever way you go for speed enhancement  hardware or software  enjoy the rush!</p>

<p align="left">Out with the old, in with the Speed! Clearing your PC of unwanted programs, temporary files, and other buildup is no longer a daunting task with our helpful guide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">What do aging movie actors and PCs have in common? They can both be returned to their youth through clever engineering.</p>

<p align="left">Of course (and more seriously) its good to know when to retire or get a new computer. But before you give up on that aging PC just yet, we wanted to give you eight software-based solutions to make your hardware a star again.</p>

<p align="left">
<strong>Tip #1: Clean Out Your Hard Drive</strong></p>

<p align="left">A major cause of system slowdown is data that is no longer being used, such as old downloads and files. This includes programs that run background processes when you start your computer  even if you dont need them. You can edit your start-up programs using tools built into Windows 7 and remove unused files manually, but programs are available that quickly and easily clean your hard drive.</p>

<p align="left">The following programs can optimize your system and speed things up:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.glarysoft.com/products/utilities/glary-utilities/">
<strong>Glary Utilities</strong></a>
<strong>:</strong> This free program cleans out temporary files, edits start programs and streamlines your system for optimum performance. It not only cleans and defragments your drive, but it also seeks orphan programs and files and tries to re-link them or delete them, if they cant be linked to anything on your computer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner">
<strong>CCleaner</strong></a>
<strong>:</strong> This free program is smaller than Glary, so its popular with users who have very full hard drives and systems. It doesnt contain a defragmenting program.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/defraggler/features">
<strong>Defraggler</strong></a>
<strong>: </strong>A free, stand-alone defragmentation program by Piriform, CCLeaners manufacturer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.mydefrag.com/">
<strong>Mydefrag</strong></a>: A free and fast defragger that includes several ways to optimize your disks performance.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://tiny.cc/4hcwi">
<strong>Iolo System Mechanic</strong></a>: This is a commercial, dedicated diagnostic and repair program that automatically identifies and fixes problems that slow your computer down.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/tech_09/repair.html">
<strong>Staples PC Tune Up +:</strong></a> Wed be remiss if we didnt offer up our own expertise on this issue within our own article. Staples EasyTech offers a PC Tune-Up + service in a variety of locations, including in our stores, in your home or office, or even online.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left">
<strong>Tip #2: Defragment Your Hard Drive</strong></p>

<p align="left">Once your system is clean, you should defragment your hard drive to get optimal performance. Hard drives store data, but the data eventually gets spread out all over the drive. When this happens, you will notice a performance slowdown as your hard drive searches to piece the data together. A defragmentation program moves all the data for each program to a single location, so your hard disks read and write speeds are quicker.</p>

<p align="left">Windows 7 contains a 
<strong>Disk Defragmenter</strong> (located in 
<strong>System Tools</strong>), but third-party software provides more versatility, speed and deeper cleaning.</p>

<p align="left">Remember this? 
<a href="http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/tech-services/get-help-now/pc_tune_up/">Staples PC Tune Up +</a> service is a multifaceted one that also performs disk defragmentation. The service will clean out your unnecessary files, defragment your hard drive, perform a virus scan to detect spyware and malware, and check all your start-up programs to be sure your PC is operating at its peak level. As we mentioned earlier, Staples PC Tune Up + can be run at your home, office or remotely over the Internet.</p>

<p align="left">
<strong>Tip #3: Get Rid of Viruses</strong></p>

<p align="left">If you want to keep your computer in peak condition, be sure it doesnt pick up a virus. 
<a href="http://tiny.cc/3tfhr">Norton 360</a> is a general-purpose utility program that provides robust antivirus protection, tunes up your PC and performs basic defragmenting, cloud-based backups and other maintenance tasks. If you are already infected, Norton eliminates the virus, too.</p>

<p align="left">
<strong>Tip #4: Use Windows 7 ReadyBoost</strong></p>

<p align="left">Windows 7 ReadyBoost enables your software to use the empty space on a flash drive or card to increase your speed. You turn this feature on or off when you plug in a drive and the Autoplay dialog appears. Choose 
<strong>Speed up my System</strong> in 
<strong>General Options</strong>, and then choose the 
<strong>ReadyBoost</strong> tab in 
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>

<p align="left">Like a good Hollywood plastic surgeon, you can revive your PC and have a few more hits before its time to retire your computer for good.</p>

<p>Don't make the mistake of believing your antivirus software will protect you from all threats! No program in the world can override the user if he or she wants to click on or install something new.</p>

<p>One popular email scam is known as phishing, which is email that appears to come from your bank or credit institution, and fishes for confidential information like account numbers and Social Security numbers. Always open your browser and type in the address of the bank manually, to be sure it connects to the correct location.</p>

<p>Some newer browsers block certain sites automatically with pop-up warnings that you may be about to open an infected website. Heed these warnings!</p>

<p>Even emails from your closest friends can be scams sent by a worm. If an email looks fishy to you in any way, always write back to confirm the source (in a blank new message window; dont hit Reply) before you click on any links or attachments.</p>

<p>Cars arent the only things with aftermarket accessories, additional PC accessories can improve performance and add extended capabilities to your laptop or desktop.</p></blockquote>

<p>Accessorizing your computer can sometimes be like putting lipstick on a pig: No matter how much lipstick you put on, its still a pig. But there are some cards, devices and drives that will boost your performance or extend your computers capabilities.</p>

<h2>Internal Hard Drives</h2>

<p>If youre looking to add an internal hard drive to your PC, we recommend a solid-state drive (SSD). An SSD is more reliable than a conventional hard drive, because it has no moving parts. Additionally, they run five to six times faster than a standard hard drive.</p>

<p>SSDs are most often used as internal drives since their speed will significantly increase your computers performance. Solid-state drives have limited storage capacity  currently reaching (and exceeding) 480GB  so theyre much better suited for running system software, games and applications, rather than for archiving data. Staples can install an SSD into your computer.</p>

<h2>External Hard Drives</h2>

<p>Conventional external hard drives are ideal as backup devices. Theyre easy to use and small enough to fit on your desk. Over the past few years, their prices have dropped and their capacity has grown.</p>

<p>Flash and card drives are ideal for moving data between devices, but have slow data-transfer rates and are prone to getting lost. Some flash and card drives can encrypt and password-protect your data, so if you lose the drive you probably wont lose your job! New flash drives that use USB 3.0 will transfer data ten times faster than those with USB 2.0.</p>

<h2>Video Cards</h2>

<p>Most high-end computers come with good graphics cards already installed, but older or less-expensive computers can see a performance improvement by adding a new video card. It takes processing pressure off of your computers central processing unit (CPU), and handles everything needed to generate visuals and support high-definition displays and multiple monitors. A video card increases the rendering and performance of most computer games and graphic-oriented programs.</p>

<h2>Webcams, Tablets and Going Wireless</h2>

<p>With the rise of free video-chat software such as Skype and MSN Messenger, webcams (cameras) are becoming more popular. Many newer PCs come with cameras and microphones built into them, but usually they are neither high definition (HD) nor high quality. For better sound and picture quality, many users prefer a third-party webcam.</p>

<p>Pen tablets, which allow you to use a pen-shaped stylus in place of a mouse, are common additions for graphic artists computers, but non-artists are using them as a mouse substitute. People with carpal tunnel syndrome or other hand/wrist issues may find using a pen to be much less stressful to use than a mouse, though the learning curve for switching to a new input device can be stressful at first.</p>

<p>Wireless keyboards and mice are also in demand today. This combo can be used to navigate and watch Internet TV, as well as operate your PC.</p>

<p>Today's Internet is a hall of wonders. In the wrong hands, though, it can quickly become a house of horrors. Invasive software known as malware can quietly infect your PC at any time, threatening to destroy your computer's speed, your financial security and even your identity.</p></blockquote>

<p>The good news is that malware is usually avoidable. PC makers and software geeks have spent years refining their systems to prevent unwanted attacks, and today most malware cannot simply install itself.</p>

<p>The bad news? Hackers and criminals have become adept at exploiting something far more reliable: user error. Click the wrong link or open a bad email, and you could find your PC surrendering to an invading army in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>The only sure way to avoid such threats is to know thy enemy. With that in mind, here's a list of the top malware threats:</p>

<h2>Viral Villains</h2>

<p>The virus remains the godfather of all malware. These little snippets of code attach themselves to the programs running on your PC. When you open the program, the virus runs. What it does from there is often anyone's guess: it could do something as innocuous as making copies of itself, or as nasty as searching your computer for credit-card information.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Viruses and their host programs must be opened to run. If you've downloaded any software from a site you've never heard of, run a scan first using your antivirus software. You should stick with software vendors you know and trust.</p>

<h2>Wicked Worms</h2>

<p>One especially aggressive kind of virus is the worm. Unlike a traditional virus, which requires a program to be opened, worms can do their dirty work without any assistance at all. You could be off the PC and out of town, and that worm will continue to tunnel into your computer's files, make copies of itself, and worse. Like viruses, worms can perform all kinds of evil tasks, from sending infected emails to your friends to installing special software (known as a keylogger) that records everything you type.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Worms tend to infect computers through risky activities such as opening dangerous Web sites or clicking links in spam emails. Avoiding these threats should keep your PC free of creepy crawlies.</p>

<h2>Terrible Trojans</h2>

<p>Trojans, or Trojan Horses, are without doubt the most deceptive member of the group. What makes Trojans especially insidious is how they get into your PC in the first place. Trojans arrive disguised as legitimate software. That software may have the same name and icon as a familiar program, which can make it difficult to distinguish real from fake. But open it up, and you'll feel like you've opened Pandora's box. Suddenly a new bad guy has been set loose on your files and privacy.</p>

<p>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Trojans must be downloaded and installed by the user, so never install software from anyone other than a legitimate vendor. When in doubt, check the address at the top of your browser to make sure you're on the site of, say, Staples (not Stapels).</p>

<h2>Caution Counts</h2>

<p>The best way to fight malware of every stripe is simply to avoid the tricks that malware programmers love: spammy Web sites, fake emails, bogus financial documents and suspicious links on the Web. Stay within the good neighborhoods of the Web, double-check all emails and financial notices, and click only when confident.</p>

<p>The bottom line when it comes to the modern malware threat? Education remains the best security system around.</p>

<title>So You Say Your Data Was Deleted</title>
<description>Accidentally deleting data can make for some unnervingly anxious moments, but the good news is that there's likely a chance you'll be able to get it back if you take the right steps.</description>

<p align="left">Accidentally deleting data can make for some unnervingly anxious moments, but the good news is that there's likely a chance you'll be able to get it back if you take the right steps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">If you do so, there is an excellent chance your data can be easily recovered. This first step to data recovery is also true for digital cameras and flash drives: Turn them off after you make an accidental deletion and perform data recovery as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 align="left">
<strong>Why Wait?</strong></h2>

<p align="left">The reason this is so important is because of the way hard drives save data. When you delete a file, it doesnt get immediately erased. Instead, the operating system places a question mark in its file name. The question mark flags the operating system that this file is eligible to be overwritten (which, by the way, is why you should not use question marks in your file names). If you delete a file, then start work on a new document and save it, theres a good chance your system will overwrite the deleted file and make it unrecoverable. However, by just stopping and closing everything down, you stand a greater chance of getting your data back.</p>

<h2 align="left">
<strong>Do-It-Yourself Data Recovery</strong></h2>

<p align="left">For those users that are comfortable using diagnostic software, some commercial products are available. However, if you dont know what youre doing, you may make things worse, especially if the problem is being caused by pending hard drive failure.</p>

<p align="left">You can tell when your hard drive is failing by listening for these sounds consistently coming from it: whizzing, whirring or clicking. If you hear them, the chances are your drive is dying and you need to get the drive to a technician.</p>

<h2 align="left">
<strong>Staples In-Store Data Recovery</strong></h2>

<p align="left">Despite what Microsoft says, deleted files can be recovered. After you shut down your computer, take it to a Staples store and let technicians  who know what theyre doing and have all the proper tools  handle your data recovery.</p>

<p align="left">If Staples cant recover your files in the store, they will send it to a professional data-recovery laboratory. If the data cant be recovered in the store or the lab, there is no charge to you.</p>

<h2 align="left">
<strong>Data Recovery Laboratory Services</strong></h2>

<p align="left">In certain circumstances, such as hard drive failure, water damage, a hard fall or if the above methods havent worked, you can pay for a professional recovery service to retrieve the data. These services are like a CSI forensics lab, only for computers.</p>

<p align="left">The recovery technicians work in a clean-room lab, dressed to prevent dust and dirt from getting into any electronic parts. They take the physical drive apart and, if possible, piece together your deleted data. If your data is recovered, it will be returned to you  depending on the size of the files  on DVDs, a flash drive or a new hard drive.</p>

<p align="left">The bottom line: Choose your data-recovery options wisely, and your deleted files can be brought back.</p>
