<p>
The Twitter Navigator is based on the <strong><a
href="http://www.infomous.com" target="_blank">Infomous</a></strong>
interactive text cloud technolgy. This cloud provides a visual summary of Tweets.

<p>Word size indicates relevance; the larger the word, the more relevant
it is to stories posted on the site throughout the day. Only the 40 or
so most relevant words appear. Related terms and concepts are linked
together with lines.</p>

<p>Click a word to show links to relevant stories on the site. Click
any link to open that link in a new page. Click anywhere to close the
list. Double-click on a word to focus content around it. Focus mode
places that word in the center of the screen and rearranges the rest
of the cloud so that only those words related to the focus word remain
in view. To exit focus and return to overview mode, click the pushpin
icon. </p>
