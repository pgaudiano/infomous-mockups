interactive text cloud technolgy.</p> 

<p>Word size indicates relevance; the larger the word, the more relevant
it is to stories posted on the site throughout the day. Only the 40 or
so most relevant words appear. Related terms and concepts are linked
together with lines.</p>

<p>Hover your mouse over a word to show links to relevant stories on the
site. Click on a word to focus content around it. Focus mode places
that word in the center of the screen and rearranges the rest of the
cloud so that only those words related to the focus word remain in
view. To exit focus and return to overview mode, click that word
again. </p>
